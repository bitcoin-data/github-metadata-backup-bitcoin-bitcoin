    "body": " _Originally posted by @plebhash in [#33899](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33899#issuecomment-3568788623)_\n\n> we are getting reports of out-of-memory crashes on https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-apps/pull/59#issuecomment-3568252007\n> \n> initially I suspected there could be thread-related issues similar to what I reported on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33923, but it turns out it was the VPS running out of it's 2GB available RAM, which only happened after long (12h+) running sessions\n> \n> so I leveraged [`psrecord`](https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord) to observe how Bitcoin Core (a14e7b9dee9145920f93eab0254ce92942bd1e5e from `30.x` branch) was consuming RAM across time (connected to `mainnet` for high mempool activity, for about ~1h to have enough chain tip updates)\n> \n> this is RAM consumption of Bitcoin Core with the Rust code from https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-apps/pull/59 (more specifically SRI Pool at https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-apps/pull/59/commits/57576e083e82fb5acd5dbad75e8b4de7158a3d61) connected to it:\n> \n> <img width=\"640\" height=\"480\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/452a8246-9fdb-490c-b1d1-57a51ebb7c92\" />\n> \n> there's a clear upwards trend in RAM consumption, which made me wonder if we were doing something wrong on the Rust code\n> \n> so then I ran it alongside [`sv2-tp`](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-tp) for a comparison:\n> \n> <img width=\"640\" height=\"480\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edf8fbf0-c05e-43ad-8883-ba76fb43138b\" />\n> \n> which shows a similar upwards trend that never gets throttled down\n> \n> ---\n> \n> I don't know whether the root cause for this is related to template memory management, but there's a chance it is, so I'm reporting it here rather than opening a new issue \n\n _Originally posted by @Sjors in [#33899](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33899#issuecomment-3569959628)_\n\n> I'm planning to make similar plots for #33922 (without CPU and ideally with marks to indicate where blocks were found).\n> \n> If you're measuring the process memory instead of only the template memory (which #33922 enables), you'll want to hold the mempool itself constant. E.g. by picking some value for `-maxmempool` and waiting for it to fill before starting the measurement. You also want to set `-dbcache` to its minimum, because that's also accuring  \n\n _Originally posted by @Sjors in [#33899](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33899#issuecomment-3570523079)_\n\n> @plebhash it looks like you found a real bug. Because `BlockTemplate::createNewBlock` doesn't have a context param, it looks like its destroy method is not invoked until sv2-tp disconnects. So the node keeps holding on to templates even though the Template Provider already pruned them.\n> \n> I'll open a PR to fix that.  \n\n _Originally posted by @plebhash in [#33899](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33899#issuecomment-3570541428)_\n\n> that's good to know!\n> \n> but do we have to explicitly call `destroy` or is it sufficient to drop the reference from memory on the client side?\n> \n> from my understanding of capnp, I believe it should be sufficient to drop it from memory, but on the other hand there must be a reason for `destroy` to exist? \n\n _Originally posted by @Sjors in [#33899](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33899#issuecomment-3570785658)_\n\n> @plebhash IIUC libmultiprocess does this automatically, but only `sv2-tp` uses that library. So it probably depends on how the rust capnp library is implemented. It might be worth testing how that library behaves out of the box, with and without the fix here. Just look for the `IPC server destroy` messages on the Bitcoin Core side (preferably tested against master). \n\n\n\n",

Because `BlockTemplate::createNewBlock` doesn't have a context param, it looks like its destroy method is not invoked until sv2-tp disconnects.\n\nI can imagine there's a bug causing the block template not to be freed until the disconnect happens, but I don't think `createNewBlock` method having a context parameter would affect this. Having a context parameter just allows the method to run on an asynchronous thread without blocking the event loop, instead of running on the event loop thread. But which thread the block was created on should not affect how it's destroyed",

This is most important if objects have nontrivial destructors, or if it matters what order objects get destroyed.\n\nBlock templates using a lot of memory in a memory-constrained environment could be another reason to call `destroy` explicitly. But if adding `destroy` calls to the client fixes a memory leak, this does sound like a bug, because memory should be freed soon after references are dropped even without explicit `destroy` calls.\n\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33899#issuecomment-3570523079\n\n> its destroy method is not invoked until sv2-tp disconnects\n> \n> The reason `destroy` wasn't called by sv2-tp was not because of a missing `context` param, but because of an unrelated regression.\n\nI was looking into this to remind myself what current behavior is. It actually changed sort of recently, but before the 30.0 release in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/commit/949573da84112388f68d1893f55aae0ca7f12d0c from https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/160. The commit mention there mentions \"this change causes the ProxyServer::m_impl object to be freed shortly after the client is freed, instead of being delayed until the connection is closed.\"\n\nBefore that change, libmultiprocess would only delete server objects if the client explicitly called a `destroy` method, or when the connection was cleaned up. But currently it should delete them immediately even if a `destroy` method is never called. The previous behavior didn't matter very much for libmultiprocoess c++ clients call which `destroy()` internally in their own destructors, but could matter for rust and python clients which don't do that.",

      "body": "here are some insights from the experiments I’ve been running over the past few days.\n\nWhen I first reported this issue (https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-apps/pull/59#issuecomment-3568252007), my server was also running a few utility tools that I typically use during long test sessions.\n\nTo eliminate the “maybe it’s something else eating the memory” hypothesis, I started a fresh session with **only** the following running:\n\n* `sv2-apps`\n* Bitcoin Core v30 (mainnet)\n* The essential system processes\n  *(no extra utilities, no accessories)*\n\n**Server specs (VPS):**\n\n* 2 vCPUs\n* 2 GB RAM\n* Ubuntu 24.04 LTS\n\n  ```bash\n  Distributor ID: Ubuntu\n  Description:    Ubuntu 24.04 LTS\n  Release:        24.04\n  Codename:       noble\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## Baseline Start\n\nAt startup, with the full SV2 stack running (two apps using IPC), the total memory usage hovered between **800 MB and 1 GB**, with some expected minor spikes.\n\nAfter letting it run overnight, the total VPS RAM usage sat around **1.5 GB**.\n\nDuring that same period:\n\n* Bitcoin Core increased by roughly **160 MB**\n* But the *rest* of the increase could not be explained by Bitcoin Core alone\n* This made me suspect the `sv2-apps` were also growing over time\n* A few hours later, @plebhash confirmed with `psrecord` that the apps were indeed growing as well\n\n<img width=\"2336\" height=\"1420\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63bc97da-a902-47d1-a89f-595c5d060f1d\" />\n\n---\n\n## Next 8 Hours\n\nOver the next 8 hours, total RAM usage climbed from **1.5 GB → 1.6 GB**.\n\nSince I had a bit of headroom left, I decided to stress things slightly.\n\n---\n\n## Adding More Load\n\nAlongside the already-running apps, I launched **three more pool instances** (also using IPC).\n\nWithin ~3 hours:\n\n* Bitcoin Core’s RAM usage increased (expected because of more IPC traffic, I think)\n* Total RAM climbed to **1.75 GB**\n\nI then shut down the extra pool instances.\n\nHowever:\n\n* **Bitcoin Core did *not* release the memory**\n* Even by the next morning, RAM usage was still between **1.69–1.75 GB**\n* So it seems Bitcoin Core doesn’t reduce its memory footprint after clients disconnect\n\n<img width=\"2268\" height=\"1420\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1ec3bb7-04b2-4235-b714-3baa0bac41a3\" />\nThe screenshot is half an hour after I closed the extra pool instances.\n\n---\n\n## Final Incident (Today)\n\nSince the VPS was close to running out of RAM again, I repeated the test:\nI spun up one more pool instance using IPC. RAM usage jumped to **~1.82 GB**.\n\nI closed the pool instance and waited to see if memory would drop. It didn’t.\n\nA few hours later, the OS killed Bitcoin Core:\n\n```bash\nTue Nov 25 14:51:01 2025] Out of memory: Killed process 2763434 (bitcoin-node) total-vm:13471820kB, anon-rss:1302224kB, file-rss:2916kB, shmem-rss:0kB, UID:0 pgtables:19496kB oom_score_adj:0\n```\n\nSo at the moment, Bitcoin Core ends up consuming about **1 .3GB** of RAM and never seems to shrink back down.\n\n## Why I’m Reporting This\n\nI’m sharing these observations because they might help narrow down the behavior we’re seeing, both in Bitcoin Core and the SV2 apps.\n\nI’m also willing to run another clean testing session.\nIf you have recommendations for specific instrumentation or profiling tools to run, I can set them up.\nRight now, I avoided using things like `psrecord` during the run so I could rule out secondary tools affecting the memory footprint.",

That's the equivalent of how v30.1 will behave when it comes out.\n\nBuilt Bitcoin Core at commit **a14e7b9dee9145920f93eab0254ce92942bd1e5e**:\n\n```bash\nroot@srv-f20833:~/Projects/bitcoin/build/bin# git log\ncommit a14e7b9dee9145920f93eab0254ce92942bd1e5e (HEAD -> 30.x, origin/30.x)\nMerge: d0f6d9953a ae63cc4bf2\nAuthor: merge-script <fanquake@gmail.com>\nDate:   Thu \n```\nRan the same stress test again (spawning multiple IPC-heavy apps).\n\n**Observed differences:**\n\n* Core feels noticeably more tolerant. Baseline RAM usage is ~100 MB lower. I could spin up more apps simultaneously without Core hitting big spikes, looks like it’s using less memory per connected app.\n* However, after disconnecting the extra pool I used for stress testing, the RAM **doesn’t drop back down** to the original baseline (the level seen when only the SV2 apps + Core were running). It stays elevated, as if it’s still serving several pool apps.\n\nEven when disconnecting all the apps. It does not return to its ~700MB of consumption\n\n<img width=\"1980\" height=\"1362\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b111e0a-2c2b-4446-b3c4-5dabffa64841\" />\n\n",

      "body": "Thanks the the updates! If I'm understanding correctly, it seems like memory usage increasing 160MB overnight and 100MB over next 8 hours, and this would be pretty consistent with block templates not being freed. I think there are two key unknowns here:\n\n- We don't know whether the client is holding onto the block template references. If it is, then the memory usage going up would be expected and this is client bug, otherwise it is a server bug.\n- We don't know if server is failing to release block templates when the client disconnects. The fact that RSS number does not decrease when the client disconnects suggests that server is failing to release memory, but it's not a reliable indicator, because it only show much memory has been allocated by the OS to the process, but not how much memory is actually in use by the process. When the C library frees memory, it's normal for it to hold onto the pages that were in use and not return them to the OS. It's possible to see how much memory is actually in use using a tool like [heaptrack](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/heaptrack)\n\nProbably a good next step would be to add log statements to `BlockTemplateImpl` constructor and destructor and write a python test program creating a template, and seeing if the destructor is actually called on sudden disconnect, or when calling the `destroy` method, or when just deleting the reference with `del template; await asyncio.sleep(0)`. This could indicate if there's an obvious problem with the IPC server. It does seem like there is a real leak here, but it's not clear if it this is caused by a bug on the client side or server side.",

It's probably also a good idea to have the client emit a log message when it discards a template. If the client waits until disconnect you'll see a flood of destroy methods at that point.\n\nIf the latter isn't happening, that could suggest a bug where Bitcoin Core doesn't release the memory after the client disconnects. As suggested by @ryanofsky adding logging to `BlockTemplateImpl` and `~BlockTemplateImpl` should reveal this.",

It's probably also a good idea to have the client emit a log message when it discards a template.\n\nI just did some tests with:\n- Bitcoin Core v30 binary downloaded from official website\n- `mainnet` (for frequent template updates)\n- SRI Pool from commit https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-apps/commit/ecf5f258766ac9e08bd8aaaa53b45b1c1bf961d8 (and also `RUST_LOG=debug` for extra

      "body": "Following up on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33940#issuecomment-3578402033, I added log statements to the `BlockTemplateImpl` constructor and destructor and wrote a python test creating a block template object and calling the destroy method or not (`DESTROY` variable), and deleting the python template variable or not (`DEL` variable). As soon as either of these things were done, I could see the `~BlockTemplateImpl` destructor being called. I could also see the destructor being called just disconnecting regardless of whether these things were done. I tested with current bitcoin master and with the v30.0 tag and saw the same behavior in both.\n\nThis test would seem to indicate that the leak is happening on the rust client side, and that when the bug happens, the client is probably not dropping references to all old templates or calling `destroy` on them, since doing either of these things should be sufficient to free memory on the server. It is possible there is a more subtle bug on the server side, and not a problem on the client, but so far I haven't seen behavior that looks like a problem. The test program looks like:\n\n<details><summary>test-destroy.py</summary>\n<p>\n\n```diff\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport asyncio\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport shutil\nimport capnp\n\nSRC_DIR = \"/home/ryanofsky/work/bitcoin/src\"\nSOCK_PATH = \"/home/ryanofsky/.bitcoin/regtest/node.sock\"\nDESTROY = 1\nDEL = 1\n\nclass IPCInterfaceTest:\n    def main(self):\n        if capnp_bin := shutil.which(\"capnp\"):\n            capnp_dir = Path(capnp_bin).resolve().parent.parent / \"include\"\n        else:\n            capnp_dir = Path(capnp.__path__[0]).parent\n        src_dir = Path(SRC_DIR)\n        mp_dir = src_dir / \"ipc\" / \"libmultiprocess\" / \"include\"\n        imports = [str(mp_dir), str(capnp_dir), str(src_dir)]\n        self.capnp_modules = {\n            \"proxy\": capnp.load(str(mp_dir / \"mp\" / \"proxy.capnp\"), imports=imports),\n            \"init\": capnp.load(str(src_dir / \"ipc\" / \"capnp\" / \"init.capnp\"), imports=imports),\n            \"echo\": capnp.load(str(src_dir / \"ipc\" / \"capnp\" / \"echo.capnp\"), imports=imports),\n            \"mining\": capnp.load(str(src_dir / \"ipc\" / \"capnp\" / \"mining.capnp\"), imports=imports),\n        }\n        print(\"Running mining test\")\n\n        async def async_routine():\n            ctx, init = await self.make_capnp_init_ctx()\n            mining = init.makeMining(ctx)\n            opts = self.capnp_modules['mining'].BlockCreateOptions()\n            opts.useMempool = True\n            opts.blockReservedWeight = 4000\n            opts.coinbaseOutputMaxAdditionalSigops = 0\n            template = await mining.result.createNewBlock(opts)\n            print(\"Created template\")\n            if DESTROY:\n                template.result.destroy(ctx)\n                print(\"Destroyed template\")\n            if DEL:\n                del template\n                await asyncio.sleep(0)\n                print(\"Deleted template\")\n            await asyncio.sleep(1000)\n\n        asyncio.run(capnp.run(async_routine()))\n\n    async def make_capnp_init_ctx(self):\n        connection = await capnp.AsyncIoStream.create_unix_connection(SOCK_PATH)\n        client = capnp.TwoPartyClient(connection)\n        init = client.bootstrap().cast_as(self.capnp_modules['init'].Init)\n        threadmap = init.construct().threadMap\n        thread = threadmap.makeThread(\"pythread\").result\n        ctx = self.capnp_modules['proxy'].Context()\n        ctx.thread = thread\n        return ctx, init\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    IPCInterfaceTest().main()\n```\n</p>\n</details>",

One thing I'm not sure about is why exactly the rust client is keeping 84 block template references. Is this because of lack of `interruptWait` method and inability to delete templates before `waitNext()` returns? Or are the references being kept because the blocks might need to be submitted? Or maybe some other reason?\n\nI guess from looking at the rust code, it is currently designed to hold onto all templates and then free them when the tip changes. If so, this seems reasonable and should hopefully not use too much memory since the blocks should contain many of the same transactions. I guess the logs also indicate that rust code is able to trigger blocktemplate deletions on the server side, so this also seems good. If I'm understanding correctly, your logs here seem to show the rust client behaving well and deleting the templates it doesn't need.",

I've been experimenting with the v0.1.0 pool_sv2 app on regtest with a python script to generate transactions & connect blocks quickly to make a memory leak happen without needing to wait a long time.\n\nSo far, behavior has been mostly as expected, where generating lots of transactions without connecting new blocks causes block templates to accumulate and memory usage to go up, but when a new block is connected, the templates get released by the mining client.\n\nOne thing I saw that was surprising was that if the python client connected blocks too quickly, the mining client seemed to fall behind and only release templates after a delay. Like the mining client would be calling `destroy` method on the template from block height 5000 when block height 5015 was being connected. But pausing the python script would cause the mining client to catch up.\n\nI guess I need to try letting the code run a longer time to see if memory usage will accumulate. But I think a slow & gradual leak could be pretty difficult to debug and fix. So if there's anything that can be done to trigger a leak quickly, it will make this debugging this issue a lot easier.\n\n<details><summary>test/functional/test-generate.py</summary>\n<p>\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom test_framework.authproxy import AuthServiceProxy\nfrom test_framework.address import create_deterministic_address_bcrt1_p2tr_op_true\nfrom test_framework.messages import (\n    CTxOut,\n)\nfrom test_framework.script import (\n    CScript,\n    OP_RETURN,\n)\nfrom test_framework.util import (\n    get_auth_cookie,\n)\nfrom test_framework.wallet import MiniWallet\nfrom random import randbytes\n\nSRC_DIR = \"/home/ryanofsky/work/bitcoin/src\"\nDATADIR = \"/home/ryanofsky/.bitcoin\"\nSOCK_PATH = \"/home/ryanofsky/.bitcoin/regtest/node.sock\"\n\nINIT_BLOCKS = 200\nBLOCKS_TO_MINE = 300\nTXS_PER_BLOCK = 100\nTX_BYTES = 50000\n\ndef main():\n    rpc_u, rpc_p = get_auth_cookie(DATADIR, \"regtest\")\n    host = '127.0.0.1'\n    port = 18443\n    url = \"http://%s:%s@%s:%d\" % (rpc_u, rpc_p, host, int(port))\n    node = AuthServiceProxy(url)\n\n    print(f\"Generating {INIT_BLOCKS} blocks without transactions\")\n    node.generatetoaddress(1, create_deterministic_address_bcrt1_p2tr_op_true()[0])\n\n    print(\"Creating wallet\")\n    wallet = MiniWallet(node)\n\n    print(f\"Generating {BLOCKS_TO_MINE} blocks with transactions\")\n    for i in range(BLOCKS_TO_MINE):\n        bheight = node.getblockcount()\n        bhash = node.getblockhash(bheight)\n        print(f\"block{i} height={bheight} hash={bhash}\")\n        for j in range(TXS_PER_BLOCK):\n            tx = wallet.create_self_transfer(fee_rate=0)[\"tx\"]\n            tx_data = [randbytes(TX_BYTES)]\n            tx.vout.append(CTxOut(nValue=0, scriptPubKey=CScript([OP_RETURN] + tx_data)))\n            tx.vout[0].nValue -= tx.get_vsize()  # simply pay 1sat/vbyte fee\n            txid = wallet.sendrawtransaction(from_node=node, tx_hex=tx.serialize().hex())\n            assert txid == tx.txid_hex\n            print(f\"  {bheight=} {bhash=} {tx.txid_hex=}\")\n            assert tx.txid_hex in node.getrawmempool(True)\n        node.generatetoaddress(1, create_deterministic_address_bcrt1_p2tr_op_true()[0])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>diff</summary>\n<p>\n\n```diff\n--- a/src/node/interfaces.cpp\n+++ b/src/node/interfaces.cpp\n@@ -858,11 +858,24 @@ class BlockTemplateImpl : public BlockTemplate\n public:\n     explicit BlockTemplateImpl(BlockAssembler::Options assemble_options,\n                                std::unique_ptr<CBlockTemplate> block_template,\n+                               std::atomic<int>& count,\n                                NodeContext& node) : m_assemble_options(std::move(assemble_options)),\n                                                     m_block_template(std::move(block_template)),\n+                                                    m_count(count),\n                                                     m_node(node)\n     {\n         assert(m_block_template);\n+        int c = ++m_count;\n+        uint256 hash{m_block_template->block.hashPrevBlock};\n+        CBlockIndex* block{WITH_LOCK(cs_main, return chainman().m_blockman.LookupBlockIndex(hash))};\n+        LogError(\"==== CONSTRUCT BlockTemplateImpl() ptr=%p count=%i height=%i\", this, c, block ?

      "body": "> if the python client connected blocks too quickly, the mining client seemed to fall behind and only release templates after a delay\n\nThere's a hardcoded 10(?) second grace period where the Template Provider (both implementations) hold on to templates after a new tip is connected. It's there for two reasons:\n\n1. Trying to relay the block anyway (requires further node changes, since we currently honour the first-seen rule even when that means \"our\" block loses)\n2. Giving pools a chance to verify the template (via JDS) and award shares (especially in [schemes that reward both hash power and total fees](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/pplns-with-job-declaration/1099)) \n ",
