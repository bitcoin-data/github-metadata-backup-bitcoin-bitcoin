    "title": "MyPy, Next Steps",
    "body": "MyPy was added in #18210, allowing for static type checking of type hints in our testing framework.  However, there is still some work to be done before we can take advantage of these new capabilities. 🚀 \r\n\r\nRight now, `lint-python.sh` runs MyPy with the `--ignore-imports` flag.  This is done primarily to ignore the lack of type hinting for `zmq`, but it hides many errors in our own code too.\r\n\r\nTo begin to see what's needed, first run `mypy test/functional`.  You'll see two sets of errors.  One complains about `Skipping analyzing 'zmq'`.  This one can be ignored for now by changing the identified `import zmq` lines to `import zmq # type: ignore`.  \r\n\r\nThe other states that it `Cannot find implementation or library stub for module named 'data'`.  Remember that for a second.\r\n\r\nNow **go into** `test/functional/test_framework` and run `mypy mininode.py`.  Observe two more `Cannot find implementation or library stub for module` errors, now for `test_framework.messages` and `test_framework.util`.\r\n\r\nWhat's happening here is that MyPy is failing to handle importing our `test_framework` package.  We'll need to do a few things to fix this.\r\n\r\n- [ ] MYPYPATH and/or mypy_path\r\n    - Using either the environment variable MYPYPATH or the config file option `mypy_path` we need to tell MyPy where to find our `test_framework` package.\r\n  * <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#finding-imports>\r\n- [ ] Stub Files\r\n  * We need to create stub files (ending in `.pyi`) for the modules in `test_framework`\r\n  * <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-type-hints-for-third-party-library>\r\n  * <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubs.html#stub-files>\r\n  * This can be made much easier with [stubgen](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html), and possibly [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or [PyAnnotate](https://github.com/dropbox/pyannotate)\r\n- [ ] Remove --ignore-missing-imports and add `# type: ignore` to `import zmq`\r\n  * `--ignore-missing-imports` simply hides too many errors.\r\n\r\n#### Resources \r\n\r\n* <https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/4542>\r\n* <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/existing_code.html>\r\n\r\n#### Important Notes\r\n\r\nOur minimum supported python version is 3.5, so any changes must be compatible.  In particular this means that we must use type comments, as opposed to type hinting, in variables that aren't function parameters. (i.e. `foo # type: int` as opposed to `foo: int`). This will complicate the use of MonkeyType, as it doesn't support type comments. It may be useful to make a scripted diff between type comments and type hints.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nMyPy experience\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",

This is the minimum amount of work needed to get mypy running in the linter, after which annotations can be added to scripts in `contrib/` and `test_framework/` to get the full benefit of running mypy in the linter.\r\n\r\n## special notes\r\n\r\nThis also involved updating PyZMQ per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19389#issuecomment-850092152 .\r\n\r\n## how to test\r\n\r\nafter making these changes, I ran `./test/lint/lint-python.sh` and verified no errors. \r\n\r\nTo be sure mypy would actually catch type errors when they existed, I added the following lines to `contrib/devtools/symbol-checker.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef check_imported_symbols(filename: str) -> bool:\r\n    test = filename + 1\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, `filename` needed to be annotated as str, or else mypy treats it as `Any` and `Any +1` is allowed. After annotating `filename: str` and adding an illegal operation, running ./test/lint/lint-python.sh` returned the following error:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncontrib/devtools/symbol-check.py:170:5: F841 local variable 'test' is assigned to but never used\r\ncontrib/devtools/symbol-check.py:170: error: Unsupported operand types for + (\"str\" and \"int\")  [operator]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## next steps\r\n\r\nWhere we do have mypy annotations, they are often incomplete. This causes mypy to evaluate arguments as `Any` (see example above with `symbol-checker.py`). I propose a follow-up PR adding annotations. At a minimum, annotations should be added for everything in `test_framework/`, which can be done fairly easily with `monkeytype`. The benefit of this is, now that we are running without `--ignore-imports`, mypy can detect errors in the functional tests even if they don't have annotations, so long as all of the files in `test_framework/` are fully annotated.",

It is not like color formatting in the test framework output is any critical feature.\r\n\r\n> UPD: for the ignored imports the description suggests generating stub files\r\n\r\nI am not sure if we want to maintain stub files for third party python packages that we use. Is the effort going to be worth the additional checks? `jinja2` is only used to print logs, a feature that is know to be working and unlikely to break. `lief` I am not sure. An alternative would be to just wait for the upstream project to add the annotations and do nothing here?",
