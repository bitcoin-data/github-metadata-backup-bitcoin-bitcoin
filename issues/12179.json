    "body": "commit 45cf8a03cb57b8639a8d47323bde46ba22d9eeaf\r\n\r\nI recently made a transaction with too-low fees. I was in a hurry to get it confirmed, so I clicked \"increase transaction fee\" a bunch of times. Each time I clicked it, it added an extra transaction to the transactions tab.\r\n\r\nEventually one of the transactions confirmed, and all the others were marked as \"conflicted\". I right-clicked each of the conflicted transactions in turn and selected \"abandon transaction\". That caused them to disappear from the transactions tab.\r\n\r\nWhen I restarted the client, all the conflicted transactions reappeared. I was hoping they would be gone permanently.\r\n\r\nAm I misunderstanding what \"abandon transaction\" should do, or is it not working correctly?\r\n\r\nEdit: two related points from this experience:\r\n\r\n1) I wanted to double the fee, but \"increase transaction fee\" didn't give me any way to say how much to increase it by, so I had to click it maybe 20 times to get to the fee I wanted.\r\n\r\n2) I was able to select all the conflicted transactions at once, and right-click the group. When I selected \"abandon transaction\" on the group, it only deleted one transaction from the display, not all of them. Why let me select multiple transactions if the right-click menu only operates on one of them anyway?",
