Can't it just download the amount of necessary and most recent data or a method developed for it and to speed up adoption of pruned nodes that will never keep all that amount of data ?\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nRelated to the incredibly long time that takes to sync the whole blockchain. It also contributes to waste bandwidth for data that will never be kept locally and delays the time for starting using the node that may take a whole week to finish a sync.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nDevelop a method for a node when configured to run in pruned mode to only download the necessary data enough to run the pruned node and keep validating new blocks.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "Thanks @maflcko\r\nThe point perhaps it to find the proper way to implement this that doesn't cause trouble to these scenarios where a pruned node can be used and older stuff may almost never need to be accessed, and if so can be fetched as necessary.\r\n\r\nI consider this is an issue given the very long time it takes to sync the whole blockchain, the amount of bandwidth wasted for something that could be simplified and improved greatly. This can also contribute to more adoption for people to run their own nodes much easier and quicker (not having to wait for the entire and perhaps unnecessary sync) and contribute further to the network.\r\n\r\nThese other tools are not for requests, but more informal tools to discuss stuff freely where information can easily get lost and not always captured properly. The issue tracker allows the directly involved people to discuss and find out the proper solution to an existing issue.",
