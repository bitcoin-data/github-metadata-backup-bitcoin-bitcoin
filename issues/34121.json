    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nI run the lightning node SilentBob and recently nuked my Bitcoin chainstate or blocks database while trying to fix my issues with running out of disc space.\n\nResyncing turned out to take many days, even on modern hardware. In fact, I'm still waiting two days later with the estimated time remaining constantly switching between many hours, many days or even many weeks at times (13th gen i7 10 core CPU, super fast NVME 2TB SSD, 16 gig ram, 12 gig reserved for bitcoin... 500 Mbit cable connection).\n\nLuckily @C-Otto saved me by providing me with his blocks and chainstate directories and he mentioned that he might be able to provide the same service to others if there is any demand.\n\nSo I thought I should bring this up here and inquire if there is any interest in reviving bootstrapping again, as it has existed until 2014: https://bitcoin.org/bin/block-chain/README.txt\n",

      "body": "> Resyncing turned out to take many days\n\nDo I understand you correctly that this was a full Initial Block Download (i.e. no prior state locally) or was it a `-reindex` or `-reindex-chainstate`?\n\n> 12 gig reserved for bitcoin\n\nCan you please share the exact configs you have started the node with? Using a dbcache that large can sometimes result in memory swapping which dramatically slows down execution. We found that there's rarely a need to go beyond 3GB dbcache.\n\n> 500 Mbit cable connection\n\nThat should suffice, but if it's over TOR, it can often take days.\n\nLastly, which Core version were you using? Older ones have a low `assumevalid` which forces script (re)validation which can slow down simple devices a lot. Core v30 can do IBD 200% faster than e.g. v25 - make sure you use the latest.\n\nAlso, we're working on parallelizing part of the validation work (block input fetching for example), it should result in another 30-50% speedup, see: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31132. Even on simple Umbrel and Raspberry 5 devices we're getting validation speeds of 7-10 hours with that.",

      "body": "> So I thought I should bring this up here and inquire if there is any interest in reviving bootstrapping again, as it has existed until 2014: https://bitcoin.org/bin/block-chain/README.txt\n\nIt won't help you. If synchronization takes days, it's not the downloading that's the bottleneck, but validation. Validating a bootstrap.dat would take just as long. (Unless of course your network connection somehow is that slow, but in that case downloading the bootstrap.dat file will just be as long)\n\nThe bootstrap.dat approach was abandoned because it's generally faster to just sync from the network since Bitcoin Core 0.12, as it downloads and validates in parallel. If you use bootstrap.dat, you need to first download the whole file, and only then validate it.",

Feel free to continue conversation in here after close, if you like :)\n\nAs mentioned above, assumeutxo is still bottlenecked on validation speed, and therefore not comparable to a \"trusted datadir clone\" in terms of \"sync\" performance, but if you do want to try it out and find the torrent files unreliable or slow, I host some of the more recent snapshot files at https://utxo.download/ for direct download.",
