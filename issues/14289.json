    "title": "Unbounded growth of scheduler queue",
    "body": "In `validation.cpp`, both `ConnectTip` and `DisconnectTip` invoke a `GetMainSignals()...` callback, which schedules a future event though the CScheduler interface.\r\n\r\nThese functions are called in 3 places:\r\n- `ActivateBestChainTipStep`\r\n- `InvalidateBlock`\r\n- `RewindBlockIndex`\r\n\r\nThe first of these 3 prevents the scheduler queue from growing unboundedly, by limiting the size to 10 in `ActivateBestChainTip`. The other two however do not, and @Sjors discovered that doing a giant `invalidateblock` RPC call will in fact blow up the node's memory usage (which turns out to be caused by the queue events holding all disconnected blocks in memory).\r\n\r\nI believe there are several improvements necessary.\r\n\r\n1. (short term symptom fix) If this issue also appears for `RewindBlockIndex`, we must fix it before 0.17, as this may prevent nodes from upgrading pre-0.13 code. I think this is easy, as this function is called prior to normal node operation, so it can easily be reworked to release `cs_main` intermittently and drain the queue.\r\n\r\n2. (long term fix) The use of background queues is a means to increase parallellism, not a way to break lock dependencies (as @gmaxwell pointed out privately to me, whenever a background queue is used to break a dependency, attempts to limit its size can turn into a deadlock). One way I think is to have a debug mode where the background scheduler immediately runs all scheduled actions synchronously, forcing all add-to-queue calls to happen without locks held. Once everything works in such a mode, we can safely add actual queue size limits as opposed to ad-hoc checks to prevent the queue from growing too large.\r\n\r\n3. (orthogonal memory usage reduction) It's unfortunate that our `DisconnectBlock` events hold a shared pointer to the block being disconnected. Ideally there is a shared layer that only keeps the last few blocks in memory, and releases and reloads them from disk when needed otherwise. This wouldn't fix the unbounded growth issue above, but it would reduce the impact. It's also independently useful to reduce the memory during very large reorgs (where we can't run callbacks until the entire thing completed).\r\n",

It should not be used to break locking dependencies. Any uses of the queues for the exclusive purpose of breaking locking dependencies should be probably be removed because by definition every one of those cases results in \"unbounded\" memory usage.  (technically there may be a \"bound\" but the resulting bound is impossible to reason about without consider the total behaviour of every lock touched by every piece of code that takes the lock(s) in question-- e.g. the entire codebase).  Effectively proving that the memory usage isn't unbound is equivalent to proving that multiuse contention of the lock without the unbounded queue couldn't deadlock.\r\n\r\nAlso, as we've learned elsewhere the queue is actually pretty slow. So it may not be a suitable tool for improving performance through concurrency in many applications. It certainly shouldn't be deployed as such without benchmarks that show that it actually improves performance.",

          "body": "This PR makes a number of improvements to the InvalidateBlock (`invalidateblock` RPC) and RewindBlockIndex functions, primarily around breaking up their long-term cs_main holding. In addition:\r\n* They're made safely interruptible (`bitcoind` can be shutdown, and no progress in either will be lost, though if incomplete, `invalidateblock` won't continue after restart and will need to be called again)\r\n* The validation queue is prevented from overflowing (meaning `invalidateblock` on a very old block will not drive bitcoind OOM) (see #14289).\r\n* `invalidateblock` won't bother to move transactions back into the mempool after 10 blocks (optimization).\r\n\r\nThis is not an optimal solution, as we're relying on the scheduler call sites to make sure the scheduler doesn't overflow. Ideally, the scheduler would guarantee this directly, but that needs a few further changes (moving the signal emissions out of cs_main) to prevent deadlocks.\r\n\r\nI have manually tested the `invalidateblock` changes (including interrupting, and running with -checkblockindex and -checkmempool), but haven't tried the rewinding (which is probably becoming increasingly unnecessary, as very few pre-0.13.1 nodes remain that would care to upgrade).",

It adds a Travis job that runs the functional test suite with this flag enabled.\r\n\r\nYou can verify that the flag works as intended by applying this diff\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/test/validation_block_tests.cpp b/src/test/validation_block_tests.cpp\r\nindex 44432cd0a1..bb4046f119 100644\r\n--- a/src/test/validation_block_tests.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/test/validation_block_tests.cpp\r\n@@ -27,6 +27,7 @@ struct TestSubscriber : public CValidationInterface {\r\n \r\n     void UpdatedBlockTip(const CBlockIndex* pindexNew, const CBlockIndex* pindexFork, bool fInitialDownload) override\r\n     {\r\n+        SyncWithValidationInterfaceQueue();\r\n         BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(m_expected_tip, pindexNew->GetBlockHash());\r\n     }\r\n```\r\nrebuilding with `./configure ...

And if it did work while showing me a timeout, why did the sync restart after the block was invalidated?",

Luckily, #9014 makes this a bit eaiser to fix - dont keep more than a few blocks around in shared_ptrs, just re-read them from disk after the reorg is complete when you need to call signalers. This may be complicated due to pruning, but it should be doable.\n",
