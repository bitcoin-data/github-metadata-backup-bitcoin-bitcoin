    "body": "Add an EffectiveSan (Effective Type Sanitizer) CI job to detect sub-object overflows (bounds errors within the same object) and type errors (accessing memory using the wrong type).\r\n\r\n* [EffectiveSan tool](https://github.com/GJDuck/EffectiveSan)\r\n* [EffectiveSan paper](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gregory/papers/pldi18types.pdf)\r\n\r\n> **Q: Why do we need EffectiveSan when we already have AddressSanitizer?**\r\n> \r\n> AddressSanitizer is a popular tool for detecting memory errors such as bounds overflows and use-after-free errors. EffectiveSan can also detect these kinds of errors, as well as other classes of error that AddressSanitizer cannot detect, such as:\r\n> \r\n> * **Sub-object overflows**: Bounds errors within the same object. AddressSanitizer can only detect overflows that escape the bounds of the allocation; and\r\n> * **Type errors**: Accessing memory using the wrong type.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I'm swamped with way too much non-Bitcoin non-crypto development work for the foreseeable future so realistically I won't have time to add it myself, but I thought I could add an issue for it at least and hope that someone with more Bitcoin Core time can run with the idea :)",
