    "title": "avoid using invalidateblock to directly test reorg behavior",
    "body": "### Motivation\n\nWhile working on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32516 I found that for testing mempool entry from reorged blocks, directly using invalidateblock to trigger the reorg has at least a couple behaviors that don't match real reorgs:\n\n1) Only allows 10 deep reorg before it stops trying to re-enter things into the mempool\n2) doesn't respect descendant chain limits(Sets of PreChecks isn't run once per reorg but once per block, letting longer chains slip in)\n\nthe code paths greatly diverge from normal re-orgs, which makes this problematic for actual testing.\n\nThe setup being used:\n1) build blockchain of stuff you want re-entry for\n2) invalidatblock to the desired fork off point\n\nOne example to look at would be https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3f83c744ac28b700090e15b5dda2260724a56f49/test/functional/mempool_ephemeral_dust.py#L350 or any other tests in `mempool_*.py` that use invalidateblock to simulate reorgs and mempool re-entry.\n\n\n### Possible solution\n\n\nWe should make sure that in our reorg/mempool tests spread across the codebase that we don't do it this way and instead:\n\n1) Prep fork chain of sufficient length\n2) invalidate the fork chain\n3) do normal test setup\n4) reconsiderblock the previously invalidated chain\n\nThis appears to match the intended test coverage.\n\n### Useful Skills\n\nUnderstanding of python test suite\n\n### Guidance for new contributors\n\nWant to work on this issue?\n\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\n",

      "body": "> ### Motivation\n> While working on [#32516](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32516) I found that for testing mempool entry from reorged blocks, directly using invalidateblock to trigger the reorg has at least a couple behaviors that don't match real reorgs:\n> \n> 1. Only allows 10 deep reorg before it stops trying to re-enter things into the mempool\n> 2. doesn't respect descendant chain limits(Sets of PreChecks isn't run once per reorg but once per block, letting longer chains slip in)\n> \n> the code paths greatly diverge from normal re-orgs, which makes this problematic for actual testing.\n> \n> The setup being used:\n> \n> 1. build blockchain of stuff you want re-entry for\n> 2. invalidatblock to the desired fork off point\n> \n> ### Possible solution\n> We should make sure that in our reorg/mempool tests spread across the codebase that we don't do it this way and instead:\n> \n> 1. Prep fork chain of sufficient length\n> 2. invalidate the fork chain\n> 3. do normal test setup\n> 4. reconsiderblock the previously invalidated chain\n> \n> This appears to match the intended test coverage.\n\nThanks @instagibbs for identifying the issue, I have opened a draft PR to address this. Will notify once its ready for review!\n\n",
