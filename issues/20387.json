    "title": "Bitcoind to use RPC authentication cookie from file",
    "body": "I'm running bitcoind 0.20.1 inside a Docker container and would like to access its RPC interface from another container.\r\n\r\nDocker has a way to manage secrets like the RPC authentication cookie and safely pass them between containers. Effectively, it mounts the secret as a file like `/run/secrets/rpc_cookie`. I'd like bitcoind to use the cookie from that file.\r\n\r\nI tried `-rpccookiefile=/run/secrets/rpc_cookie`, but bitcoind tries to write to that file and fails. Of course, it's read-only.\r\n\r\nAlternatives: Docker doesn't support to insert secrets (which can be any data, including binary) into configuration files or to pass it as a command line argument (which would leak the cookie  anyway, I guess).\r\n\r\n**Proposal:** I propose adding a mode in which bitcoind reads the authentication cookie from file, rather than trying to create a new one. That mode could be auto-enabled if the specified cookie file exists on startup and is read-only.\r\n\r\nSide note: Because of at least one consumer of the RPC API (electrs) only supports reading cookies from file (both command like arguments and environment variables are deemed insecure), I will now have to define the same secret at two places – which I think has a higher risk to leak the secret.",

      "body": "This seems like a good thing to support, but maybe it would be cleaner to use password authentication instead of cookie authentication here. Cookies being secrets chosen by the server, and passwords being secrets chosen externally. But if not getting caught up in cookie/password semantics, we could add a `-rpccookiegenerate`/`-norpccookiegenerate` boolean option defaulting to true, to toggle between either generating the cookie internally or allowing a cookie value to be specified externally. I think adding an option to use external cookies would be better than automatically trusting read-only cookie files, which might be created unintentionally or maliciously.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion to solve the immediate problem of using bitcoin and electrs with docker secrets: maybe you could have docker generate `/run/secrets/bitcoin_password` and have a startup script include it in electrs and bitcoind configurations (bitcoin `-includeconf` option might be useful here).\r\n",
