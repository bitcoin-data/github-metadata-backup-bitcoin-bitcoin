I type ./bitcoind -daemon and start the server again. however it stop, I run the \"top\" in the termination and watch, the progress of bitcoind just show for a while, and then disappear.\r\n\r\nI delete all the data inside the ~./bitcoin folder, and start over. this time, the phenomenon happened again when the datachain size reach around 65G.\r\n\r\nI don't know why this happened, And I don't know whether this happened in others computer. I cannot find the answer on the internet, like goole or baidu [a web search engine in China], most of the results I searched via the goole or baidu are how to make money with bitcoin or how to do a wish vestment with bitcoin, very few tech answer about my problem.\r\n\r\nSo. it is very appreciated if someone can help me with it!!",
