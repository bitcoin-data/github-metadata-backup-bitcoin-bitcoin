    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nI will describe bitcoins main security issue of wallets and its security standard 1/2^256 valid possiblity. if anybody or any organisation can successfully make a quantum or a photonic processor they can brute force wallets private keys and they can move the coins. they can lock the coins, they can cause transaction losses and bitcoin will be over. \r\nAs blockchains nature coins are created from nothing and sent to the wallet address of miner and blockchain record wallet address and coin together. \r\ni recommend people to connect the receiving wallet address to transmitting wallet address of users.  bitcoin user should add a bridge to double check and verify it by passing coins from their receiver wallet address and secondly transmitter wallet should transmit blockchain tx to bitcoin nodes. so receiver wallet addresses should be locked to only one transmitter address. \r\n\r\nto improve bitcoin what should add to bitcoin full node database\r\ntransmitter wallet should be created first and receiver wallets should take first sats from it. master transmitter wallet should have a flag as master, master wallet should have ability to change and to create wallets with /master or /slave flags. \r\nin this point master address can make a buffer wallet and use it for sending bitcoins and it can hide behind One time Used wallet.\r\ntransmitter wallet address should have random encoded nonce in its address.\r\n\r\nfor example if somebody trying to brute force master(transmitter wallet) its record on blockchain will have nonce and this address will be seen as one of random fake addresses created using public key of master wallet.\r\n\r\nreceiver wallets must use first transaction sender as a single valid tx address. receiver wallets should have slave flags.\r\nso we can align some wallets together with blockchain verified order. \r\n\r\nwhy this come to my mind?\r\ni am using 100+ bitcoin wallets and i need to check the balances etc daily. i want to make hierarchy for wallets.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nits not seem as a problem now but we need it for a better future.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
