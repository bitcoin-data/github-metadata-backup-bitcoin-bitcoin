With this change, there's _only_ static by default, so default configs continue to only build one set of objects.\r\n> \r\n> With this commit, if you want shared libs/dlls, you'd need to configure with `--enable-shared`, which will _then_ build everything twice. For a project that's mostly about executables, that seems reasonable to me. (Also, amazingly `--enable-shared --disable-static` does the right thing and also builds a single copy of everything for shared libs)\r\n> \r\n> This also means we don't have to special-case the Windows case in this pr. We'll just know that `--enable-shared` is busted on windows (and maybe warn as such for that config?)\r\n> \r\n> The only downside I can think of is that devs aren't going to be linking the lib every day as part of their typical workflows so link problems may show up around release time. IMO that's a reasonable trade-off.",

Other workarounds see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/10a626a1d6776447525f50d3e1a97b3c5bbad7d6/configure.ac#L61-L68) and [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/10a626a1d6776447525f50d3e1a97b3c5bbad7d6/configure.ac#L690-L692).\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids using Libtool for the `libunivalue` library at all. After bitcoin/bitcoin#22646 the `libunivalue` library been built not using its own build system. In such a context it will never be a shared library. Therefore, no need to use Libtool, and the `libunivalue` library could be a non-Libtool convenience library.\r\n\r\nBtw, I strongly believe such an approach could also solve bitcoin/bitcoin#19772.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFWIW, while working on this PR I found a more concise fix:\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/Makefile.univalue.include\r\n+++ b/src/Makefile.univalue.include\r\n@@ -4,3 +4,6 @@ LIBUNIVALUE = libunivalue.la\r\n noinst_LTLIBRARIES += $(LIBUNIVALUE)\r\n libunivalue_la_SOURCES = $(UNIVALUE_LIB_SOURCES_INT) $(UNIVALUE_DIST_HEADERS_INT) $(UNIVALUE_LIB_HEADERS_INT) $(UNIVALUE_TEST_FILES_INT)\r\n libunivalue_la_CPPFLAGS = $(AM_CPPFLAGS) -I$(srcdir)/$(UNIVALUE_INCLUDE_DIR_INT)\r\n+if TARGET_WINDOWS\r\n+libunivalue_la_LDFLAGS = -static\r\n+endif\r\n```\r\n",

And it fails, for example, for https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f58c1f1a446716a245ca204e2ac1a219455f1340/src/util/strencodings.h#L58-L59\r\nwhen building `libbitcoinconsensus-0.dll` which [in turn](https://www.sourceware.org/autobook/autobook/autobook_137.html)\r\n> effectively consists of two parts; the DLL itself which contains the shared object code, and an import library which consists of the stub functions which are actually linked into the executable, at a rate of one stub per entry point.\r\n\r\n## Third benefit\r\n\r\nThe resulted binaries got smaller because a linker only extracts from a convenience library those object files that are _actually_ referenced in the code being linked (that could be easy to verify by comparing `nm` outputs):\r\n\r\n- master

We shall see.\r\n\r\nI don't see why we should be refactoring our code, that works everywhere else, and adding more libraries, to work around a problem that occurs for a single OS, and in some part, only in certain build configurations. Especially if we know that it's libtool that is \"broken\", it'd seem better for us to just use a single, well documented, scoped to the Windows use of libtool workaround, as opposed to changing our source code to accommodate its quirkiness.\r\n\r\nNote that #24994 alone seemingly doesn't fix all the issues, i.e #24972, so even if we went ahead with either/both changes, we're still going to continue to carry the windows-only libtool workarounds we've already got in our build system, which I'd say is the worst of both worlds (code refactoring + still having windows libtool workarounds). I'd rather add one more (well documented) libtool workaround to the pile, and hope that this may all become a moot point some time into the future (cmake 🦆s).

      "body": "I'm not sure I understand the discussion about nested librarries, or avoiding libtool. This problem has nothing to do with libtool except that libtool is the one guilty of adding the problematic define.\r\n\r\nPlease note also that any library could be causing this problem. It just happens to be libpthread. It could equally be libevent or libzmq.\r\n\r\nAlso please note that `DLL_EXPORT` is not any kind of magic define or token. It's a convention used by libtool, similar to autoconf's `HAVE_CONFIG_H`. In this case though, there's a clash of uses.\r\n\r\nHere's the snippet we're dealing with in pthread.h:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#if defined DLL_EXPORT\r\n#ifdef IN_WINPTHREAD\r\n#define WINPTHREAD_API __declspec(dllexport)\r\n#else\r\n#define WINPTHREAD_API __declspec(dllimport)\r\n#endif\r\n#else\r\n#define WINPTHREAD_API\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's part of the explanation I provided in the patch to upstream:\r\n\r\n> \r\n> When building a libtool lib, libtool automatically defines \"DLL_EXPORT\" for objects intended to be linked into a shared library.\r\n> \r\n> Applications are then intended to also define \"DLL_EXPORT\", which has the effect of importing the functions from the exported dll.\r\n> \r\n> However, this goes bad when a downstream user is itself a libtool lib which is attempting to statically link in libpthread. libtool sets \"DLL_EXPORT\" for itself as expected, so that the downstream lib can export its own symbols. HOWEVER it also has the effect of trying to _import_ the libpthread symbols, which doesn't work because libpthread is being linked statically rather than as a dll.\r\n\r\nSo the problem is that we're trying to import when building a dll. [From the Microsoft docs:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/importing-function-calls-using-declspec-dllimport?view=msvc-170)\r\n\r\n> You only want to use __declspec(dllimport) when calling DLL functions from outside the DLL itself. Don't use __declspec(dllimport) on functions inside a DLL when building that DLL.\r\n\r\nThe fix is thus to avoid doing the dllimport when building our own dll.  The nice way would be to have a define that could be set to avoid it. This is the [fix I've proposed upstream.](https://sourceforge.net/u/theuni2/mingw-w64/ci/cf09b48dae24316b06fee83b23eb0af574bb5f14/)\r\n\r\nBarring that, we just need to avoid having `DLL_EXPORT` defined in any file that ends up including pthread.h. Libtool appends this by default. The configure change I've proposed above prevents libtool from doing that, thereby fixing the problem.\r\n\r\nAnother solution might be to add `-UDLL_EXPORT` to AM_CPPFLAGS, overriding libtool's define.\r\n\r\nEdit: In case it isn't clear/obvious, upstream winpthreads itself is build using libtool, which is why they use that define and why it's colliding with ours.",

Linking dependencies of a dynamic library into it statically can also make sense, but can cause problems because this can leave you with multiple instances of the same static library having to coexist inside the same process, each with their own separate global variables, and possibly inconsistent function definitions. This is ok if libraries are high level, and you aren't trying to share pointers or handles between the different library instances. I don't think we know if this applies to pthreads, but Cory's upstream patch should let us find out.\r\n",

I explored this a little bit today because I agree a single dll may or may not be how we want to ship in the end.\r\n\r\nIn fact, to your point, libstdc++ currently still gets linked dynamically. This can be fixed as usual (I did a quick check) by adding `-static-libstdc++` to the dll link flags, but it definitely begs the question: do we want to ship a few dll's instead?\r\n\r\nI think at least in the beginning we should try to lump everything into a single dll. By controlling our exports (I think) we should be able to avoid leaking out symbols like `pthread_create` which would obviously be problematic.\r\n\r\nBut I agree it's very possible we run into startup problems or handle collisions or something that forces us to switch to multiple dll's. Something like an app  interacting with `thread_local` vars on a thread spawned by the dll... I could see that going sideways.\r\n\r\n",

ASLR was functioning for the rest of our binaries, mostly by accident, because:\r\n> [All other Windows binaries that we distribute (bitcoind, bitcoin-qt,\r\nbitcoin-wallet, bitcoin-tx and test_bitcoin) do not suffer this issue,\r\nand currently having working ASLR. This is due to them exporting\r\n(inadvertent or not) libsecp256k1 symbols, and, as a result, the .reloc\r\nsection is not stripped by ld.](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18702)\r\n\r\nUpstream, libsecp256k1 has recently made a change to [no-longer export symbols in static libraries](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1105) (see related discussion in #25008). This would mean that on the next subtree update, anyone building using an older binutils (< 2.36) would be (silently) producing Windows binaries with non-functioning ASLR. Our release binaries would not be affected, as in our Guix environment we currently use binutils 2.37.\r\n\r\nTo prevent users building with older binutils from silently losing ASLR on Windows, this PR applies our work around (export `main`) to the rest of our binaries, and updates the associated documentation to mention the affected binutils versions, so we know when it can be dropped.\r\n\r\nI've included both the libsecp256k1 subtree update, and the ASLR related changes in this PR. Happy to split the changes up if reviewers would prefer.\r\n\r\nGuix Build (x86_64):\r\n```bash\r\n24fa1053fa3d310c4274f0700ac36f3c6e5b4486dc7f1aa7b2a5ded6937cf2b6

          "body": "Here are some benefits of using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) in the Bitcoin Core project:\r\n- an opportunity to drop the `build_msvc` subdirectory from the repo altogether (being a cross-platform tool, CMake is able to [create](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) input files for a wide range of build systems, including Unix Makefiles and Visual Studio project files)\r\n- no hacks required to build `dll`s for Windows, even with `DEBUG=1` (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19772)\r\n- better maintainability (say _bye_ to global variables)\r\n- easy integration with [Qt 5](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/cmake-manual.html)\r\n- easy integration with [Qt 6](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/cmake-manual.html) in the nearest future (also see bitcoin/bitcoin#24798 and bitcoin/bitcoin#25191)\r\n\r\nMore Qt-specific details see below.\r\n\r\nAlso there is a non-technical/social benefit. Over time, the Autotools community shrinks, but CMake community grows. New contributors, who join this project in the future, will readily support a CMake-based system rather an Autotools-based one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Native building has been tested on the following OSes:\r\n- Ubuntu 22.04 (`x86_64`, `aarch64`~, backward compatible with Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 using adjusted invocation~)\r\n- macOS Monterey (`x86_64`, `arm64`)\r\n- FreeBSD 12.3\r\n- OpenBSD 7.1\r\n```sh\r\ncmake -S . -B build\r\ncd build\r\nmake\r\nmake check\r\nmake install  # optional\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Native building on Windows (MSVC + vcpkg)\r\n\r\nDependency packages are provided by the [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io) package manager (\"Mandatory ASLR\" in Windows Security must be disabled to install `qt5-*` packages):\r\n```cmd\r\nvcpkg --triplet=x64-windows-static install pkgconf boost-multi-index boost-process boost-signals2 boost-test libevent berkeleydb sqlite3 miniupnpc zeromq qt5-base qt5-tools\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo build on Windows with Visual Studio, a proper [generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#visual-studio-generators) must be specified for a new build tree.\r\nThe following example assumes using of \"Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022\" and CMake v3.21+.\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\ncmake -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static -S . -B build\r\ncmake --build build --config Release\r\n```\r\n\r\nHINT.

A similar [PR](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1113) has been open in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe plan is to have it in the repo shortly after branching `24.x` off, and make CMake-based build system a drop-in replacement of Autotools-based one during the next ~2 or 3~ release cycle~s~.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Qt-specific details\r\n\r\n## What happened before?\r\n\r\n- https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6-build-system:\r\n> CMake is the build system for Qt 6\r\n\r\n- https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-and-cmake-the-past-the-present-and-the-future:\r\n> We made a big decision to start using CMake to build Qt 6 one and a half years ago.\r\n\r\n- https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qt6-buildsystem.html:\r\n> The Qt 5 build system was built on top of [qmake](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.2/qtquick-deployment.html#qmake). In Qt 6, we ported the build system to CMake.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that CMake has extensive [support](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-qt.7.html) for Qt, including Qt-specific tools such as MOC, RCC, UIC.\r\n\r\n## Why Qt 6 build system does matter if the Bitcoin Core GUI uses Qt 5?\r\n\r\nFor release builds we use Qt 5.15.5 LTS, the latest Qt 5 version available under a free-software license.\r\n\r\nFor dynamic linking users can use Qt 5.11.3+, which allows them to use packages provided in Debian Buster and Ubuntu Focal.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Qt 6 packages are available in the following systems/package managers:\r\n- [Ubuntu Jammy](https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/qt6-base-dev)+\r\n- [Debian Bullseye](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye-backports/qt6-base-dev)+\r\n- [Fedora 35](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/qt6-qtbase/qt6-qtbase/)+\r\n- [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qt)\r\n\r\nAs long as Qt GUI is a part of Bitcoin Core, it is inevitable to embrace Qt 6 support, sooner or later.\r\n\r\n## Can we just adjust our current build system to handle Qt 6?\r\n\r\nThe main problem with integration of Qt 6 into the current build system is lacking of pkg-config `*.pc` files for static builds (please note that a patch from [QTBUG-86080](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-86080) works for non-static builds only).\r\n\r\nTo handle Qt 6 with our current build system we need to:\r\n- patch Qt, which looks like a non-trivial task, or\r\n- apply some [nasty hacks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24798#discussion_r854001982) to our own build system\r\n- keep in our repo the required `*.pc` files\r\n\r\nAll approaches imply maintaining burden for a long time. And last two are pretty ugly :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Autotools -- CMake Feature Parity Table\r\n\r\nAutotool-based build system (AT) features being listed according to the `./configure --help` output. \r\n\r\n| AT feature | CM feature |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| `--prefix` | `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` |\r\n| `--enable-c++20` | `-DCXX20` |\r\n| `--enable-shared` | `-DBUILD_SHARED` |\r\n| `--enable-static` | `-DBUILD_STATIC` |\r\n| `--disable-wallet` | `-DENABLE_WALLET` |\r\n| `--enable-usdt` | `-DWITH_USDT` |\r\n| `--enable-upnp-default` | `-DENABLE_UPNP_DEFAULT` |\r\n| `--enable-natpmp-default` | `-DENABLE_NATPMP_DEFAULT` |\r\n| `--disable-tests` | `-DBUILD_TESTS` |\r\n| `--disable-gui-tests` | TBD |\r\n| `--disable-bench` | `-DBUILD_BENCH` |\r\n| `--enable-extended-functional-tests` | TBD |\r\n| `--enable-fuzz` | `-DFUZZ` |\r\n| `--enable-fuzz-binary` | `-DBUILD_FUZZ_BINARY` |\r\n| `--disable-hardening` | `-DHARDENING` |\r\n| `--enable-reduce-exports` | `-DREDUCE_EXPORTS` |\r\n| `--disable-ccache` | `-DCCACHE` |\r\n| `--enable-suppress-external-warnings` | N/A |\r\n| `--enable-lcov` | TBD |\r\n| `--enable-lcov-branch-coverage` | TBD |\r\n| `--enable-threadlocal` | TBD |\r\n| `--disable-asm` | `-DASM` |\r\n| `--disable-zmq` | `-DWITH_ZMQ` |\r\n| `--enable-multiprocess` | `-DMULTIPROCESS` |\r\n| `--disable-man` | `-DINSTALL_MAN` |\r\n| `--enable-debug` | `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` |\r\n| `--enable-gprof` | TBD |\r\n| `--enable-werror` | `-DWERROR` |\r\n| `--enable-external-signer` | `-DWITH_EXTERNAL_SIGNER` |\r\n| `--enable-lto` | TBD |\r\n| `--enable-util-cli` | `-DBUILD_CLI` |\r\n| `--enable-util-tx` | `-DBUILD_TX` |\r\n| `--enable-util-wallet` | `-DBUILD_WALLET_TOOL` |\r\n| `--enable-util-util` | `-DBUILD_UTIL` |\r\n| `--enable-experimental-util-chainstate` | `-DBUILD_UTIL_CHAINSTATE` |\r\n| `--with-seccomp` | `-DWITH_SECCOMP` |\r\n| `--with-sqlite` | `-DWITH_SQLITE` |\r\n| `--without-bdb` | `-DWITH_BDB` |\r\n| `--with-miniupnpc` | `-DWITH_MINIUPNPC` |\r\n| `--with-natpmp` | `-DWITH_NATPMP` |\r\n| `--with-qrencode` | `-DWITH_QRENCODE` |\r\n| `--with-libmultiprocess` | N/A |\r\n| `--with-mpgen` | `-DMPGEN_PREFIX` |\r\n| `--with-sanitizers` | `-DSANITIZERS` |\r\n| `--with-utils` | individual options |\r\n| `--with-libs` | individual options |\r\n| `--with-experimental-kernel-lib` | `-DBUILD_BITCOINKERNEL_LIB` |\r\n| `--with-daemon` | `-DBUILD_DAEMON` |\r\n| `--with-gui` | `-DWITH_GUI` |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIRC meeting discussions:\r\n- https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-08-18#844420;",

          "title": "build: Add CMake-based build system (1 of N)",
          "body": "This is split from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797 which is a full implementation with an Autotools feature parity and has more than 80 commits.\r\n\r\nA bit [rehashed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797#issue-1330985812) list of benefits of a CMake-based build system over an Autotools-based one:\r\n\r\n## General benefits\r\n\r\n1. [Integration](https://www.kitware.com/static-checks-with-cmake-cdash-iwyu-clang-tidy-lwyu-cpplint-and-cppcheck/) with developer tools like clang-tidy, IWYU etc.\r\n\r\n2. CTest tool with a bunch of useful features, including coverage analysis, integration with sanitizers and memory check tools like valgrind.\r\n\r\n3. [CPack](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Packaging%20With%20CPack.html), a powerful packaging tool.\r\n\r\n4. Integration with IDEs.\r\n\r\n5. The concept of a \"target with assosiated properties\" is better than Autotools' global variables in many ways (robustness, readability, maintanability).\r\n\r\n6. _[social]_ A great community. CMake is actively developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Bitcoin Core specific benefits\r\n\r\nA preliminary note. Two arguments (a) \"nobody cares about X platform\" and (b) \"nobody cares about Y binary\" are out of this PR scope, as long as the X platform is promised to be supported by the Bitcoin Core project, and the Y binary is a part of the Bitcoin Core project.\r\n\r\n7. Native Windows support. No longer need to maintain `build_msvc` subdirectory.\r\n\r\n8. Correctness with Windows DLLs out-of-the-box. In comparison, the current build system has 3 ([three!](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25008#issuecomment-1113964111)) hacks of libtool. And it is still broken:\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19772\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25008\r\n\r\n9. CMake is a native build system of [Qt 6](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/cmake-manual.html).\r\n\r\n10. _[social]_ It is [expected](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797#issuecomment-1408772481) that more current and new developers are/will be able/willing to review/contribute/maintain CMake code rather Autotools stuff.\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\nThere are two goals:\r\n- merge all CMake code by v25.0 and test it\r\n- switch to the CMake-based build system by v26.0\r\n\r\n## Implementation details\r\n\r\nIn particular, this PR establishes the minimum required CMake [version](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/CMake-Versions-on-Linux-Distros). As it looks non-productive to support Ubuntu Bionic as a build platform, version [3.13](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.13.html) has been chosen. Benefits of v3.13 over v3.10 which affect our CMake code directly are as [follow](https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/blob/220807-cmake/CMakeLists.txt):\r\n```CMake\r\n#  - 3.11: add_library() and add_executable() commands can now be called without any sources\r\n#          and will not complain as long as sources are added later via the target_sources()\r\n#          command.\r\n#  - 3.11: The target_*() commands learned to set the INTERFACE properties on Imported Targets.\r\n#  - 3.12: The add_compile_definitions() command was added to set preprocessor definitions\r\n#          at directory level. This supersedes add_definitions().\r\n#  - 3.12: If the CONFIGURE_DEPENDS flag is specified, CMake will add logic to the main\r\n#          build system check target to rerun the flagged GLOB commands at build time.\r\n#  - 3.12: The target_link_libraries() command now supports Object Libraries.\r\n#  - 3.12: A new $<TARGET_EXISTS:...> generator expression has been added.\r\n#  - 3.12: A new FindPython3 module has been added to provide a new way to locate python\r\n#          environments.\r\n#  - 3.13: The install(TARGETS) command learned to install targets created outside the current\r\n#          directory.\r\n#  - 3.13: The target_link_options() command was created to specify link options for targets\r\n#          and their dependents.\r\n#  - 3.13: The target_link_libraries() command may now be called to modify targets created\r\n#          outside the current directory.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Notes for reviewers\r\n\r\nTo configure a build system, one can run in their local repo root:\r\n- on Linux / *BSD / macOS:\r\n```sh\r\ncmake -S . -B  build\r\n```\r\n- on Windows:\r\n```cmd\r\ncmake -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -A x64 -S . -B build\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo re-configure, it is recommended to use the clean build tree, for example:\r\n```sh\r\nrm -rf build\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor now, the only artifact we explicitly create in the build tree is a `bitcoin-config.h` header:\r\n```sh\r\ncat build/src/config/bitcoin-config.h\r\n```",

      "body": "@TheCharlatan symbol visibility is really complex, but it boils down to 2 main choices on our side, see here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25008#issuecomment-1113661684\r\n\r\nWe can either ship a bunch of dll's (kernel, libsecp256k1, libstdc++, libpthread, etc)\r\n_or_\r\nWe can roll everything up into 1 dll and have it just work.\r\n\r\nFor now, I propose we do the latter. However, this means we need tight control over our symbol visibility. If you're not familiar, see here for the canonical primer: https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility\r\n\r\ntl;dr: We set everything to \"hidden\", then manually mark the functions that are meant to be visible.\r\n\r\nI've pushed up a branch that defines our _current_ api as used by bitcoin-chainstate here: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commits/fix-dll-exports2 . This includes #27144 as a bugfix if you wouldn't mind reviewing.\r\n\r\nNote that this branch is just a test to see how we're currently looking. At the moment we're exporting random functions and globals all over the place. Obviously that's not ideal, but at least this helps us to see where we are.\r\n\r\nThis can be checked by building a shared bitcoin-chainstate.exe. If any of the `EXPORT_SYMBOL`s are removed, bitcoin-chainstate.exe will fail to link.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo answer your question about secp.. It is not marked as exported by libkernel (we fixed that in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1105). This means that libkernel can use secp _internally_, but any exe that links against it can't see those functions. Just like it can't see pthreads/libstdc++/etc. If exe's saw those functions, they'd collide with their _own_ toolchain functions and things would get weird.\r\n\r\nHowever, this introduces the possibility of having libkernel and bitcoin-chainstate using different secp versions. For this reason, we may decide to ship multiple dll's instead. But either way, we'll want to define our function visibility in order to build the smallest possible binaries.\r\n\r\nHope that thought-dump helps, I'd be happy discuss further in realtime.",
