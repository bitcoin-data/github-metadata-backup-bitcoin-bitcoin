    "title": "Increase # of block-relay-only connections ",
    "body": "## tldr:\r\nBlock-relay-only connections help improve partition resistance on the bitcoin network by increasing connectivity while obfuscating the network graph. To be conservative and reduce chances of unexpected network effects, initially 2 outbound block-relay-only connections per node were introduced. Since then, we have improved resource utilization and network behaviors to work towards increasing that number. Now, let’s try and do it!\r\n\r\nThis is joint work with mzumsande. #28463 proposes a specific implementation to increase the number of inbound slots for block-relay-only connections, which is a prerequisite to later increase the outbound slots. This issue is a place to discuss any conceptual questions or concerns.\r\n\r\n## History & Context: \r\nIn 2019, PR [#15759](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759) introduced 2 outbound block-relay-only connections for bitcoind nodes. The primary motivation of introducing these connections was to help obfuscate the network graph, since leaked information could help an adversary execute a partition attack. \r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, there was open questioning around how many block-relay-only connections we should add. More increases robustness but effects to consider include resource utilization and addr relay implications. Introducing 2 extra connections was evaluated to be a good first step that balanced tangible benefits with potential risk. gmaxwell mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-480400958), “ultimately I'd like to optimize memory usage for both inbound and outbound blocksonly links, then at least double the inbound connection limit for blocks only links, and make 8 blocks only links.” @sdaftuar expressed agreement with this direction [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-480868516).\r\n\r\nAt the time, there were a few different mechanisms that would be a cause for concern if the number of block-relay-only connections were increased. Many have been resolved since and we have highlighted one significant question that needs to be evaluated in the context of this proposal. Additionally, reviewers should consider if there may be any other undesirable side effects. \r\n- Addrman interactions (fixed) [PR #20187](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20187): There were a couple of nuanced interactions between block-relay-only connections and addrman that were addressed in this PR. The changes fix a privacy leak, ensure block-relay-only addresses are recognized as reliable connections, and fix a pre-existing addrman bug around active connections. \r\n- Addr relay implications (fixed) [PR #21528](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528): As @ajtowns described in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-527012757), introducing block-relay-only connections initially degraded the propagation of addr messages on the network. [PR #21528](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528) reduces addr blackholes by improving the behavior for honest nodes. The default behavior was updated to not treat inbound connections as addr relay peers until they indicated interest by initiating an address related p2p message. \r\n- Memory utilization (fixed) [PR #22778](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22778): block-relay-only connections do not require as much memory as transaction relay peers. They don’t need a `TxRelay` data structure, which is significant because the tx relay bloom filter uses approximately 500kb per peer. [PR #22778](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22778) allowed nodes to identify whether an inbound peer might ever relay transactions over the lifetime of the connection, and stop initializing the TxRelay data structure when unnecessary. \r\n- Netgroup limitation (fixed) [PR #27374](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27374): In certain circumstances, the logic to diversify netgroups of our outbound connections was limiting the total number of connections permitted by the node. This PR fixed this issue by applying separate logic for clearnet peers vs privacy network peers. \r\n- Number of available connection slots on the network (OPEN): available connection slots are a shared and limited network resource. Increasing the defaults for outbound connections should be carefully calibrated against the expected values for inbound slots over time. The next section shares context for how numbers have been selected for our proposal, and this is an area where we are very interested in reviewer feedback. \r\n- Is there anything else we are missing? \r\n\r\n\r\n## Availability of Connection Slots: \r\n#### Context \r\nThe patch in #28463 proposes values based on observing network statistics & calculating expected memory utilization. This section provides more reasoning behind selecting those numbers, so reviewers can evaluate the methodology.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental question is: how much do we need to increase inbound capacity to accommodate for increasing the number of outbounds from 10 to 16. This is tricky to answer with precision because (1) estimating the number of non-reachable nodes is hard and (2) these numbers will inevitably change over time, and we want to accommodate for fluctuations. \r\n\r\nThere is no way to guarantee sufficient connection slots - if all users disabled inbounds, the network would fail. However, we can still observe network behaviors to build confidence around projecting likely proportions that would be maintained over time. After all, the default number of 8 outbound connections dates back to [satoshi code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/94cfec07fd302c9ff9b6a80c47418d4fe56596ae) from 2010, and has successfully held up over the years 🙂\r\n\r\n#### Estimating the number of reachable clearnet nodes (per sept 2023)\r\nStatistics from various services: 6155 ([bitnodes](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/)), 8509 ([KIT](https://www.dsn.kastel.kit.edu/bitcoin/data/churn0-v.gpd)), 3862 ([Luke Dashjr](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html))\r\nQuality of data: The bitnodes number is verifiable because peers can be queried, and a random sampling has demonstrated a high probability of successfully connecting. Luke Dashjr reports significantly lower than the other two, but the methodology is not disclosed. \r\n\r\n#### Estimating the number of non-reachable clearnet nodes \r\n50956 ([Luke](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html), sept 2023, unknown methodology and included networks)\r\n32300 ([KIT Addr Spam Paper](https://www.dsn.kastel.kit.edu/publications/2022-Bitcoin-Degree.pdf) 07/21, estimated from the degrees calculated from observed addr spam)\r\n27000 - 35000 ([KIT Monitoring Paper](https://fc22.ifca.ai/preproceedings/114.pdf) 12/21, estimated from the number of gossip addrs received)\r\nBoth KIT methods don’t take into account nodes that don’t self-advertise (e.g. listen=0, or SPV clients) but do permit inbound slots. \r\n\r\n#### Extrapolating numbers\r\nLet’s use rough estimates of 8,000 reachable clearnet nodes & 40,000 non-reachable nodes. \r\n\r\nEstimated slots required for each increment to the default number of outbound connections: 48,000. \r\nRequired additional inbound slots for each increment to default outbounds: 48000/8000 = 6.\r\n\r\nWith the current network estimates, we would need at least 6 additional inbound slots for each increment to the default number of outbounds. To be more conservative, we should probably add ~8-10 inbound slots for each additional outbound. \r\n\r\nThis is all only clearnet. However, it seems likely that inbound capacity for privacy networks are higher in comparison, because unlike clearnet, there is no need to unblock ports, so accepting inbounds is the default behavior. While node operators are able to easily disable those inbounds, we’d anticipate that to happen less frequently than on clearnet where the reverse effort is required. \r\n\r\n## Future work: \r\nWe need users to adopt the changes to increase the default for inbound block-relay-only connections before we can safely increase the default for outbounds. #28463 proposes the increase in inbounds. If these changes are accepted, we would want to wait until the corresponding release is widely adopted, then have a future release update the outbound default.\r\n\r\nAnchors were implemented using block-relay-only connections to mitigate against restart-based eclipse attacks. For more context see [issue #17326](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17326) & [PR #17428](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428). If we increase the number of outbound block-relay-only connections, we will want to thoughtfully design the interactions with anchors. As sdaftuar mentions in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428#issuecomment-554073351), we will likely want to cap the anchors at 2, which entails selection logic. In [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213#issuecomment-1478551323), @brunoerg mentions the idea of having (at least) one anchor per network instead of just two generic ones. While discussing this in depth would be premature, we also want to keep these implications and options in mind as we advance the current work.",

      "body": "Good question @naumenkogs, I agree that understanding the memory usage is valuable, so I'm working on gathering more specific data. Off hand, the `m_tx_inventory_known_filter` is very large, and there's a significant worst-case amount of memory used for storing txs in the queue for sending to peers. Will report back with my findings once I get some numbers to at least roughly reconcile with each other :) \r\n\r\nOn a different note, when discussing this proposal in person, an idea came up for an alternate approach around handling allocating inbound capacity between block-relay-only and full-relay links. The idea is to identify a weight indicated the proportion of resources used by the two types of connections, and cap the amount of inbounds a node will accept based on a dynamic weighted calculation. \r\n\r\nFor example: \r\nLet's say we select a weighted score of tx-relay 5 to block-relay 1. The current configuration of 115 inbounds could map to 115 * 5 = 575 available. When running, the node would accept both types of connections, and decide if it needs to evict based on 5 * current-tx-conns + 1 * current-block-relay-conns. \r\n\r\nAn advantage of this approach is that the network would utilize inbound capacity more fully. In the current approach, especially when rolling out the increase, there would be unused slots because there's more offered for block-relay connections than the amount of outbound block-relay needed. \r\n\r\nA disadvantage of this approach is that it seems a bit tricky to communicate to node operators exactly what to expect. Also, selecting the ratio can only be a rough estimate because the different connections vary on expected/worst-case usage of memory, bandwidth & cpu. \r\n\r\nWhen changing this approach we would also want to update the inbound eviction logic to make sure that tx-relay connections cannot crowd out block-relay-only connections in a strained network environment.\r\n\r\nCurious to hear if reviewers have thoughts or preferences between the current approach (specific slots allocated to inbound-block-relay connections) or the alternate approach (have a weighted ratio to cap resource usage).",

Sometimes we're only at 6 outbound peers, would that leave more room for inbounds (say at the same time trying to always converge to 8 outbounds if that becomes possible)? Alternatively, if we have no inbounds, should that allow us to have more outbound tx-relay peers?\r\n\r\nAlso, when you say `resource usage`, should we include: memory AND bandwidth? I think @sipa thought about this approach some time ago.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a better way forward, so it's mostly a matter of dev effort allocation. It's a solid project!",

      "body": "> Should we consider outbound connections for weightening as well? Sometimes we're only at 6 outbound peers, would that leave more room for inbounds (say at the same time trying to always converge to 8 outbounds if that becomes possible)? Alternatively, if we have no inbounds, should that allow us to have more outbound tx-relay peers?\r\n\r\nhmmm, what are the intended benefits of this? \r\n\r\nfrom my POV, I think inbounds and outbounds are best treated separately. a couple reasons come to mind: \r\n- slots to connect to on the network are a shared, limited resource. we want to make sure there's sufficient inbound slots to service all nodes. this is already hard to reason about with opaque info from the network, but would be even more difficult if the amount of outbounds were variable for a node. \r\n- for a node, outbounds are selfishly necessary to ensure connection to the network. for the most part, offering inbounds is offering a service to the network more than individually benefitting (surface area of attack increases significantly) \r\n\r\n> Also, when you say resource usage, should we include: memory AND bandwidth? I think @sipa thought about this approach some time ago.\r\n\r\nyes I think we should evaluate memory, bandwidth, and even cpu usage (which can be more severe in certain network scenarios or worst-case situations) ",

I agree that we should be working to ensure that doesn't actually occur. however, in that circumstance having additional inbounds could potentially be more harmful because an adversary could slowly take over a greater percentage of connections, have more influence over the addrman, and eventually partition / eclipse the target node. so imo it makes sense to continue to treat inbounds and outbounds separately, and work on other mitigation factors to ensure this kinda scenario doesn't occur.\r\n- `\"(2) is rather a waste of resources than a benefit,\"` -> agree. the value of network inbound slots is significantly higher than the value of a specific node maximizing connections/CPU/bandwidth/memory...\r\n\r\n> \"A non-critical outbound connection\". \r\n\r\nthat's interesting. what information do you imagine makes a particular inbound slot more valuable to one node vs another? if there are available slots on the network, then there are some attributes (such as diversifying netgroup) that would value them differently, but how would a node anticipate its alternate available options?

      "body": "> Should we consider outbound connections for weightening as well?\r\n\r\nIf we're at ~100 inbounds and ~8 outbounds, the weighting doesn't make much difference -- it just means 108 inbounds vs 100, so under a 10% difference, and likely less. So I don't think it matters much either way -- if either way makes the code simpler, that would be a win, otherwise don't worry about it?\r\n\r\nOTOH, the reason we have ~8 outbounds and ~100 inbounds is because we figure ~10x as many nodes are going to be unreachable for one reason or another (behind a NAT/firewall, misconfigured, mobile and not having a consistent IP, behind an ISP that doesn't allow inbound connections). If that changed (due to increased tor/i2p usage, natpmp availability?) then it might make sense to target more of a balance between inbounds/outbounds. I think that would look more the other way though: ie, you'd be making more than 8 outbound connections if you had fewer than 30 inbounds, eg. I think that's all theoretical though, and we don't currently have a reason to change things along those lines.\r\n\r\nIMHO, YMMV, just my 2sats, etc",

My answer is — Whatever the initiator (inbound peer) says. If the peer says the connection is crucial for them, we prioritize them. Inbound slots are half-altruistic in the first place...\r\nWorst case: bad nodes always ask to prioritize them. Then, we're back to the status quo.",
