    "body": "Seen as part of this thread: https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/issues/341#issuecomment-2321282757.\r\n\r\nIt looks like CMakes https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CheckPIESupported.html check isn't quite the equivalent of what we used to do in Autotools (having `-pie` and `-fPIE` as part of our hardened flags), such that now, sometimes the user will need to manually pass flags like `-fPIE`. In this case, on a FreeBSD system.\r\n\r\nIt's not entirely clear if this is a bug in CMake, or something else, however, we should fix this, as users/developers should not need to manually pass `PIC`/`PIE` related flags for working compilation, aside from it being a missing hardening feature.",

CMake considers that `-fPIE` is not supported because it compiles the program without PIE and tries to link with PIE, which on FreeBSD only and only with `-fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping` fails to link (so the test prog fails to link, which means that the PIE test is negative, not that compilation of bitcoin core fails).\r\n\r\nIMO this is low impact and low severity.",

      "body": "> IMO this is low impact and low severity.\r\n\r\nRandomly missing (hardening) flags isn't that great. The fact that compilation still succeds (is there a warning the check failed?), also means the user is also unaware of the deficiency. We've identified  one time this happens, but there may also be others. Given the ambiguity, it may also just be easier to return to the previous behaviour of just always using the flags, rather than letting CMake guess, and sometimes get it wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there an issue open upstream?",
