    "body": "Perhaps we can consider creating different levels of net logging.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we could separate lower-frequency, important peer-level events (`netpeers`) from very high-frequency message-level passing (`netmessages`).\r\n\r\nCategories and naming suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\nOne further suggestion by @jnewbery was:\r\n> No objections. I'd take it ever further though, and add an (optional) logging severity (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR or similar) that can be added to all log messages. The user can then either choose what severity logs they want for each category (eg = -debug=net:warning,tor:debug etc), or have a logging post-processor that can filter by severity/category.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of optional logging levels (debug/info/warning/error) for each category, including the default debug log, but agreement on which events go into which level may be difficult to achieve.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I propose separating the net logging into at least two categories. Thoughts? Implementation suggestions?",

Someone will create a pull in x months to fix this for banlist.dat, then for peers.dat in y months. So finally we have 5 different error messages for the same condition.\r\n\r\n>  - Failed to read fee estimates from {}. Continue anyway.\r\n>  - Failed to open mempool file from disk. Continuing anyway.\r\n>  - Could not find anchors file {}\r\n>  - Could not find asmap file {}\r\n>  - ... Another message for banlist and peers?\r\n",
