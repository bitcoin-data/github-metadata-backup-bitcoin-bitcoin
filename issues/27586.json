    "title": "CPU DoS on mainnet in debug mode",
    "body": "I've been seeing 100% cpu usage on one of my bitcoind nodes recently, with transactions taking >60s to be accepted into the mempool. Digging into it, the problem seems to be `BOOST_MULTI_INDEX_ENABLE_SAFE_MODE`  which was introduced in #24395. That results in iterator destruction taking O(n) time (in the number of other active iterators on the same multi-index) in the worst case, rather than O(1) time, due to keeping the iterators in a [singly linked list](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/boost/multi_index/detail/safe_mode.hpp):\r\n\r\n```\r\n * Iterators are chained in a single attached list, whose header is\r\n * kept by the container. More elaborate data structures would yield better\r\n * performance, but I decided to keep complexity to a minimum since\r\n * speed is not an issue here.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpeed does become an issue here though, as we keep an iterator around for every mempool entry (in `vTxHashes`).\r\n\r\nThis isn't always a problem: presumably in the normal case new iterators are added to the head of the list then removed while they're still roughly at the head of the list, giving O(1) timing; but somehow having a full mempool (and hence TrimToSize actually doing things) triggers worst case behaviour?",

I run four public nodes (24.0.1) with different server hosts, and all four of them were spinning a CPU core at 100% and experiencing slowness with block/transaction handling when I checked them yesterday, two to the point where they started occasionally dropping connectivity to my private nodes. Like I mentioned, one 24.0.1 node which does not accept incoming connections (but is connected to untrusted nodes) did not have this issue. The other private nodes still run 23.0.0 and also do not have any issues, though these only connect through my own public nodes so they aren't directly exposed to untrusted nodes.",

I also verified that the mempool is not fully committed (usage is at 251217552).\r\n\r\nThere were around 15 peers with bytessent_per_msg.inv over 100000 without any received ones, but even after doing setban on them and verifying that they have been disconnected, the CPU usage did not drop noticeably if at all. This is probably because the node has 180 connected peers, and 140+ of those have both bytessent_per_msg.inv and bytesrecv_per_msg.inv over 100000, so disconnecting 15 of them for not sending any probably doesn't do much..\r\n\r\nBased on what you say about it being a different bug I assume that it is not an issue introduced with 24.0, but I reverted one of the nodes to 23.0 just to verify.",

Consider reducing maxconnections for now. And perhaps shrink maxmempool - may I ask why you are using 2048?",

This would show the CPU usage per thread, which could be interesting for further investigation, e.g.:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/91535/3b20748f-86db-4f4c-a185-496135d3b5ec)\r\n\r\n(FWIW I'm running a listening pruned node on some quite lame dual-core virtual server, have rarely seen more than 10-15% CPU usage the last few days; will tinker around with higher maxmempool/maxconnections settings to see if I can reproduce the issue reported above).",

In fact the highest counts on all of my public nodes is my private nodes, but not by much.\r\n\r\nA notable change happened yesterday (May 9th) around 14:25 UTC where the CPU load on all the public nodes dropped drastically at the same time, and they all look normal at present. The high-fee BRC-20 token spam we were seeing also appear to have quieted down a bit, so it seems likely that the issues were simply related to that. Unless it starts back up it might be hard to diagnose this further without artificially generating a similar traffic pattern.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the command originally provided by @ajtowns which lists the peer addresses with the inv numbers was:\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | jq -j '.[] | (.bytessent_per_msg.inv, \" \", .bytesrecv_per_msg.inv, \" \", .addr, \"\\n\")' | grep ' null ' | sort -n`\r\n\r\n(Remove the `| grep ' null '` part to show nodes that are also sending invs.)\r\n\r\nEdit: I misread your post, I see you are referring to the headers field. I'm not seeing any anomalous hits at present, and it doesn't seem consistent with the behavior I was seeing with gradual increase of CPU usage over time, but I'll check it to rule it out if the problem reappears.",

We found that when the Bitcoin wallet node processes the process message recently, the single-threaded CPU 100% causes block parsing delays, resulting in serious technical failures.\r\nOur version number is the latest version 24.0.1。\r\nNot only antpool, we also asked other mining pools and found this problem. This will lead to increasingly serious orphan blocks and forks.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nRun ProcessMessage with multiple threads to reduce the performance problem of CPU single-thread ProcessMessage.\r\nOr are there other configurations that can alleviate this problem?\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun the wallet, synchronize to the latest height, and then observe the CPU usage. You can see that there is a single-core CPU usage that remains at 100% for a long time\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv24.0.1\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 22.04 LTC\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",

Simple requests like 'getblockcount' time out.\r\n\r\nI tried running in gdb to see where the code was getting hung up. It was loading the mempool.dat file, spending lots of time in `CTxMemPool::addUnchecked()`, running this line:\r\n\r\n```vTxHashes.emplace_back(tx.GetWitnessHash(), newit);```\r\n\r\nand also in `CTxMemPool::TrimToSize()`.\r\n\r\nI added some LogPrintf() calls. It took 2380 seconds to load just 26 tx from the mempool.dat. That's 91 seconds per tx. Here's the relevant section of the [debug.log](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/11510059/debug.log).\r\n\r\nThe issue only happens when the `maxmempool` value is reached, but that's not enough to trigger it. The only time I've seen the issue happen is with the default 300 MB mempool limit. I tried using a 200 MB limit, but this issue didn't happen. Then I set it back to the default 300 and now I can't reproduce the issue.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI expect 'getblockcount' to be quick.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI'm not able to reproduce.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv25.0rc2\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nDebian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz\r\nSSL disk\r\nCable internet",

See\r\n27586 and the [boost docs](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/boost/multi_index/detail/safe_mode.hpp) for more information.\r\n\r\nRe-enable it on the CI builds which previously had it enabled.\r\n\r\nRe-enable it on the msan fuzz task so that we have fuzz tasks testing\r\nwith it enabled and disabled in this repo.",
