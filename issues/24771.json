    "body": "I think after having it integrated for a whlie (see #20487) it's time to reflect on the status of the experimental syscall sandbox.\r\n\r\nIt was worth a try, but personally I have come to the conclusion that it's unmaintainable, I don't think this is something we can ever enable by default for end users.\r\n\r\nIn practice it's haphazard whack-a-mole any time a syscall comes up and a crash happens. There's no structure or plan to it, nor an end in sight. See e.g #24659 #24369 #24340  #23555 #23299 #23255 #23208 #23179.\r\n\r\nThe whole idea of a syscall sandbox is fundamentally a layer violation. It's untenable when dynamic linking is involved, or dependencies we don't know A to Z, with evolving user-kernel space APIs. See also discussion here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24758#issuecomment-1088507575\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure it addresses relevant risks in our case. The P2P thread communicates with the outside world and the scope of an exploit to gain full RCE can ostensibly be restricted by sandboxing it. However there are bigger risks within the bitcoind/-qt process itself: messing with consensus code, stealing wallet keys. A thread-based sandbox provides only minimal protection here.\r\n\r\nIt's also single platform (Linux x86_64), and all the work would basically be duplicated for each platform added as the syscalls differ subtly.",

And I think it should be pretty easy to sandbox normal libraries we use like zmq or leveldb. But Qt is a special case and a massive library that can't be reasonably sandboxed by aborting every time an unexpected syscall is made. A more reasonable approach to sandboxing Qt would be to return -1 for disallowed syscalls and log them, instead of aborting the application. It would also be reasonable to just not restrict what syscalls the GUI thread can make and rely on higher level sandboxing (bubblewrap, etc)",

It would be fine to leave it up to the OS, or distribution, firejail, bubblewrap, apparmor, etc. What I'm less convinced of is having this in bitcoin core.\r\n\r\n> And I think it should be pretty easy to sandbox normal libraries we use like zmq or leveldb. \r\n\r\nMaybe on some OSes. Linux has a huge number of system calls, though, and it's completely unclear to me what is used when. It also varies over glibc versions, with some existing only for compatibility, for example.\r\n\r\n> If we whitelisted whole groups of syscalls like firejail (https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/blob/master/etc/templates/syscalls.txt) instead of individual syscalls\r\n\r\nSure, that's the idea, the problem is that it's a moving target.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if people want to keep maintaining this as an experimental feature that's fine with me. But I'd really not like to enable it by default, it would create many more issues than it would solve, I definitely don't want to handle crash issues or network DoS issues created by someone forgetting to add the zillionth syscall.\r\n\r\n",

For example: having multiple D/QT wallets running and if one is malicious/has-bug and process has access to user files, it could lead not only to loosing all wallet dat, also revealing some more sensitive data. As I was more and more interested in using direct wallet-to-wallet atomic-swap trading/exchange platforms, so securing those wallets was crucial, not only sandboxing wallets from each other also protecting users privacy. So im trying to create scripts that securely(sandbox)/privately(tor) way would be able to build wallets, manage wallets, run wallets, also create and manage atomic-swap based liquidity pools. Still working on finalization/tests to upload also source. For now only readme/overview and two pdfs presentations. https://github.com/nnmfnwl7/cc.setup.helper.debian   ",
