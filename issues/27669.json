    "title": "Use muhash for assumeUTXO snapshot ",
    "body": "Currently `dumptxoutset` uses `hash_serialized_2` for its `txoutset_hash`. The proposed `loadtxoutset` (#27596) then checks this against the hash we hardcode in `CChainParams`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the only way to check this hash, if you're not using it yourself, is to rollback the chain to the assume-utxo snapshot height, call the (slow) `gettxoutsetinfo` and then replay to the tip. This process is slow and potentially wreaks havoc on your lightning node if you forget to shut it down first.\r\n\r\nIf we used the MuHash instead then any user with `-coinstatsindex` can verify it with a simple `gettxoutsetinfo muhash HEIGHT`.\r\n\r\n~For good measure we should also modify `gettxoutsetinfo` so it can calculate the muhash for the current UTXO set without relying on the index. This would help users with pruned nodes (and without the index) to verify a newly proposed snapshot (if they haven't pruned beyond it).~ (we already do this)\r\n\r\nI think this can be changed after #27596 is merged. It would just require offering two snapshots for download for a while.",

Not sure if this is a huge problem, but one funny side-effect of this would be that for a chainstate with _n_ coins, there are in theory _n!_ different serializations possible that all would pass as valid (compared to just one for `hash_serialized_2`), since the order of coins doesn't matter for muhash. \r\n\r\n> For good measure we should also modify `gettxoutsetinfo` so it can calculate the muhash for the current UTXO set without relying on the index. This would help users with pruned nodes (and without the index) to verify a newly proposed snapshot (if they haven't pruned beyond it).\r\n\r\nI think calculating the muhash of the current chainstate without relying on coinstatsindex is already possible today by omitting the `hash_or_height` parameter, i.e. simply `gettxoutsetinfo muhash`? (If you want to try it out, I recommend passing `-rpcclienttimeout=0`, as the calculation takes quite long and could RPC-timeout with the default setting).",

      "body": "> However, a rolling UTXO set hash is incompatible with assumeutxo commitment schemes that involve chunking snapshots (discussed below) and so the resulting assumeutxo value might have to be a tuple consisting of `(rolling_set_hash, split_snapshot_chunks_merkle_root)`.\r\n\r\nThis is what I was getting at above. You just need a second hash that _is_ order dependent, which could be the sha256 hash of the `.dat` file, a torrent hash or the `split_snapshot_chunks_merkle_root`. I don't think that needs to live in the consensus code. It's more of networking detail (potatos, potatos since it's still an extra thing to set and review for each release).",
