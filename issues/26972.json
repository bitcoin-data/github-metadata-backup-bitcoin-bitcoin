This is especially useful for kernel, as it means that our deep serialization code no longer requires bitcoin-config.h.\r\n\r\nI apologize for the size of the last commit, but it's hard to avoid making those changes at once.\r\n\r\nAll platforms now use our internal functions rather than libc or platform-specific ones, with the exception of MSVC.\r\n\r\nSadly, benchmarking showed that not all compilers are capable of detecting and optimizing byteswap functions, so compiler builtins are instead used where possible. However, they're now detected via macros rather than autoconf checks.\r\n\r\nThis[ matches how libc++ implements std::byteswap for c++23](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/__bit/byteswap.h#L26).\r\n\r\nI suggest we move/rename `compat/endian.h`, but I left that out of this PR to avoid bikeshedding.\r\n\r\n#29057 pointed out some irregularities in benchmarks. After messing with various compilers and configs for a few weeks with these changes, I'm of the opinion that we can't win on every platform every time, so we should take the code that makes sense going forward. That said, if any real-world slowdowns are caused here, we should obviously investigate.",

As mentioned above, this should allow us to confidently remove the include from any file where it's no longer needed as in #29263",
