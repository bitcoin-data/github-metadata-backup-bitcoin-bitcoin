    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nbitcoind sync gets very, very slow on Augst 2023 in BTC chain (maybe 2/3 progressed or something like that)\n\nEarlier (e.g. first sync in 2024), it was faster, but i also used another version there. the version i use now, is v30.99.0-0ffb20dee178 (self-compiled from master branch)\n\nAND: i also changed my HW: From SSD SATA on LSI SATA-3 controller to a Seagate video SATA-33 HDD on UBS 2.0 controller (because it can bypass the to VM on VirtualBox 7.2.x on MS Window$ (maybe on Linux, i would be able to bypass PCI SATA devices or VHD files in a raw mode - but on Windows, PCIE SATA bypass is not supported and VHD file raw mode is not cleanly implemented. So i need to use USB drives to bypass it completely/in a raw mode)\n\n(But i don't think that is the problem TBH)\n\n**Currently, it needs ~1 day for 1 day in block chain:** On 2026-02-06, on blockchain it was on 2023-08-05 and now we have 2026-02-16 and blockchain sync is on 2023-08-19. **Which means, it will result in an infinite process** \n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nShould be synced in maybe 2-3 weeks maximum so i think, similar to the last sync (2024 when i remember right? But it was another version, don't know that's the reason or not?).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nbitcoind sync gets very, very slow on Augst 2023 in BTC chain (maybe 2/3 progressed or something like that)\n\nEarlier (e.g. first sync in 2024), it was faster, but i also used another version there. the version i use now, is v30.99.0-0ffb20dee178 \n\nAND: i also changed my HW: From SSD SATA on LSI SATA-3 controller to a Seagate video SATA-33 HDD on UBS 2.0 controller (because it can bypass the to VM on VirtualBox 7.2.x on MS Window$ (maybe on Linux, i would be able to baypass PCI SATA devices or VHD files in a raw mode - but on Windows, PCIE SATA bypass is not supported and bypass file raw mode is not cleanly implemented.
