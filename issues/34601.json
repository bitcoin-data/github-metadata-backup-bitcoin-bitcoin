    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nbitcoind sync gets very, very slow on Augst 2023 in BTC chain (maybe 2/3 progressed or something like that)\n\nEarlier (e.g. first sync in 2024), it was faster, but i also used another version there. the version i use now, is v30.99.0-0ffb20dee178 (self-compiled from master branch)\n\nAND: i also changed my HW: From SSD SATA on LSI SATA-3 controller to a Seagate video SATA-33 HDD on UBS 2.0 controller (because it can bypass the to VM on VirtualBox 7.2.x on MS Window$ (maybe on Linux, i would be able to bypass PCI SATA devices or VHD files in a raw mode - but on Windows, PCIE SATA bypass is not supported and VHD file raw mode is not cleanly implemented. So i need to use USB drives to bypass it completely/in a raw mode)\n\n(But i don't think that is the problem TBH)\n\n**Currently, it needs ~1 day for 1 day in block chain:** On 2026-02-06, on blockchain it was on 2023-08-05 and now we have 2026-02-16 and blockchain sync is on 2023-08-19. **Which means, it will result in an infinite process** \n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nShould be synced in maybe 2-3 weeks maximum so i think, similar to the last sync (2024 when i remember right? But it was another version, don't know that's the reason or not?).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nbitcoind sync gets very, very slow on Augst 2023 in BTC chain (maybe 2/3 progressed or something like that)\n\nEarlier (e.g. first sync in 2024), it was faster, but i also used another version there. the version i use now, is v30.99.0-0ffb20dee178 \n\nAND: i also changed my HW: From SSD SATA on LSI SATA-3 controller to a Seagate video SATA-33 HDD on UBS 2.0 controller (because it can bypass the to VM on VirtualBox 7.2.x on MS Window$ (maybe on Linux, i would be able to baypass PCI SATA devices or VHD files in a raw mode - but on Windows, PCIE SATA bypass is not supported and bypass file raw mode is not cleanly implemented.

The other low-hanging fruit could be to disable `txindex` and see if that speeds it up (and re-enable after you are synced). But I suspect without addressing other bottlenecks you might still not have a great time.",

      "body": "OK, thx, firstly, my ideas was to use it for another device, but when formated it with \"low level format tool\" (on a usb 3 adapter on laptop), i saw that it only reaches ~40mb/s (adapter and/or laptop should not be the problem here). Usually, SSDs reach 300mb/s or something like that on that usb 3.0 adapter... so the SSD seems to be \"used\". \n\n**So i will buy a new one ASAP.** BTW: What is future-proof , maybe for the next ~5y? What do you think? 3TB is OK or better 4? (maybe difficult to say haha). And a \"small card size\" USB 3.0 adapter too.* \n\n\n\n*Maybe another detail, but it's not relevant i.m.o.: The adapter on the server where VirtualBox BTC node VM is has ONLY usb 2.0 ports, but the adapter i used is USB 3.0. (USB 2.0 speed in both cases..)",
