Currently more than 99% of addresses advertised are unreachable and I foresee that we need to add better logic for pruning these unreachable addresses. I have various ideas in mind, but once this code is added then this would cause addressed from whole networks to be lost between nodes due to them not being able to determine that the node itself is not connected to the network (e.g. IPv6). The node therefore needs to be able to distinguish between whether the node it's trying to connect to is down, or whether it's unable to connect to all types of that address.\n",
