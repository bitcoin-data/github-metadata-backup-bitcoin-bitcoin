    "body": "`LimitMempoolSize` always try to remove transactions from the mempool whose age has passed the mempool expiry time limit, which is 336 hours (i.e., two weeks) by default.\n\nThere might be a case where you evict something that might be mined next. For example, the mempool was cleared and some low feerate transaction that has been in the mempool and has not confirmed in a long time due to having a low feerate is now at the top of the mempool.\nHowever, when we want to limit the mempool size, we will evict such transactions.\n\nWe can limit the harm of this by only expiring when the mempool is full now then post Cluster mempool, in addition to the transaction entry time, it would be possible to keep track of how many times you expect the transaction to confirm and it has not. If it has reached some threshold and the expiry time of the tx has been reached, then drop the transaction from the mempool because you know the transaction is likely deliberately ignored by miners (On the assumption that the node policy rules is sane and miners use tx fee as incentive for selection of transaction into their block template) hence no need to save it in the nodes mempool.\n",

Without the expiry time, you can dos a mempool with 1 single attack.",

      "body": "@davidgumberg I like the idea of expiring based on how many times a transaction was expected to be mined, but wasn't. E.g. every block, or every 10 minutes, or on a Poisson timer, run the block building code and increase a counter in the mempool for every transaction in the template. Whenever the counter reaches a certain configurable value, expire. Note that that may well mean that nothing ever expires, if everything gets mined once it's spent enough time near the top of the mempool - but that may be ok, if it's a sign there is no persistent policy difference between your mempool and miners'.\n\nOne potential issue I see that whenever we expire, we also need to expire all descendants. What if you have a very old transaction that isn't confirming (for whatever reason) but it has a very recent child? Should the child be permitted to keep its parent alive longer? This might matter in CPFP settings, if the child somehow helps the parent getting confirmed.\n\nAlso thanks for digging up the history for expiration; I was wondering if it predated RBF, eviction, and CPFP, but it looks like all those things were added roughly around the same time. I can imagine one other reason for expiration, which probably didn't exist at the time it was added: allowing transactions to be replaced for free (e.g. without the incremental relay fee, as a counter to the pinning that's caused by that). But I'm guessing that the 2-week timeout currently doesn't really help with that anyway.",

I can imagine one other reason for expiration, which probably didn't exist at the time it was added: allowing transactions to be replaced for free (e.g. without the incremental relay fee, as a counter to the pinning that's caused by that).\n\nI'll add that, back in the day, expiry would have been the only way to \"replace\" (i.e. get rid of) a non-signaling transaction that wasn't confirming.",
