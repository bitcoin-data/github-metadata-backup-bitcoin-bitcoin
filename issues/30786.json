    "title": "Testnet4 consensus failure due to timewarp related \"softfork\"",
    "body": "#30647 was effectively a soft-fork on testnet4 with no activation plan.\r\n\r\nIt reduced the timewarp mitigation allowance from 7200 to 600 seconds.\r\n\r\nIt's enforced by folks running v28.0rc1 and recent master, but not by miners.\r\n\r\nThis causes new nodes to be stuck at block 42,335: https://mempool.space/testnet4/block/00000000542792e54a720567ba66157d48cdae7bfd01c1b678d0f07a2ed56e99\r\n\r\nAs observed on BitcoinTalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5499150.msg64488234#msg64488234 and pointed out by @garlonicon in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30614#issuecomment-2324516655\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution would for a majority of testnet4 hash power to upgrade to the release candidate and call:\r\n* `bitcoin-cli -testnet4 invalidateblock 00000000000000263393ce5f648afd53676f13d360cc9f264b89351623bf1242`\r\n* `bitcoin-cli -testnet4 reconsiderblock 00000000000000263393ce5f648afd53676f13d360cc9f264b89351623bf1242`\r\n\r\nThis would cause a 16+ hour reorg for any older testnet4 node that's not stuck. Users who upgraded their node _after_ this block was created, and accepted by their node under the old rules, can either wait for this reorg to happen, or also use the above commands.",

      "body": "I think there is a small risk, that we will see a huge double-spending attempt in testnet4, because after block 00000000000000263393ce5f648afd53676f13d360cc9f264b89351623bf1242, there are transactions in the old chain, which are not picked by nodes, mining the new chain. Which means, that suddenly, when the deep reorg will revert hundreds of blocks, all of those transactions will suddenly become unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nSo, if anyone has any coins, which were received after block number 42335, then they can be easily double-spent on the new chain, by anyone, just because all of those transactions will vanish. Which means, that as long, as the chain is not yet reorged, people can submit their double spending transactions to the new chain, get them confirmed, and successfully reverse a payment, which had hundreds of confirmations, when a huge chain reorg will kick in.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is some incentive to download transactions from old node, and pass it secretly to the new node (without broadcasting to the network), because in this way, a miner can get bigger coinbase amount, than other miners.",
