    "body": "The predecessor tracking issue for this topic can be found here: #28794 This was closed since there seemed to be just one main PR left but I am reviving a topic issue for asmap because recently a few PRs have spun out of the main PR and related discussions. Aside from the somewhat tangential changes the main embedding PR is split into a series of three as of now.\n\n- Embedding implementation series\n  - [ ] #33026 \n  - [ ] #33878 \n  - [ ] #28792\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33386\n  - [ ] #33631 \n  - [x] #33632 (alternative approach to above which was abandoned) \n  - [ ] #33770 \n\n",
