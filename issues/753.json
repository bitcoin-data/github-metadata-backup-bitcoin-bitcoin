    "body": "I understand the argument for making sync start from zero at restart— otherwise most users would only ever see very high numbers, which isn't exactly useful.\n\nHowever, we have a real and obvious usability problem with the current behavior.  New users, already frustrated by how long the sync takes shutdown and restart when they get to 80% or whatever, and when they start again it goes to 0.  They believe that its going to take 18 hours to sync every startup and they give up in disgust.  Sometimes they come and rant at us in IRC,  it's even difficult to convince them that it's not really starting from zero.\nThere are probably a number of ways to handle this, any of them would be better than the current behavior.\n",
