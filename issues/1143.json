Nodes which are not listening join only one channel and get off irc after they have collected peers and have connections.\n\nIf anyone else likes this idea I can go ahead and merge it—  I was last working on it when we decided to just turn off IRC... with IRC off it seemed less important.\n",

It's complicated a bit by the fact that it only allows joining 25 channels per connection, he has some local patch that connects multiple times.\n\nThought thats not quite enough— for some reason the lfnet ircservers don't return all clients in the /who result — and nodes only /who once on connect.  The actual join messages are the only way to get noticed by everyone in the room. So even if your goal is to just be in all the channels, you're still better off joining just half and randomly hopping.\n\nJoining more or less based on something wouldn't take much work, I just don't know if we have anything great to base that decision on.\n",
