    "title": "release: ship codesigned MacOS arm64 binaries",
    "body": "[Since MacOS 11.0.1](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11_0_1-universal-apps-release-notes#New-Features), the operating system enforces that any executable must be signed before it’s allowed to run.\r\n\r\nWhen a user downloads and tried to run a MacOS arm64 binary (e.g. for [26.0](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-26.0/bitcoin-26.0-arm64-apple-darwin.tar.gz)), the first interaction they get is the error that `“bitcoind” is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Bin.`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"260\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/69010457/97ed147e-aa74-484c-a56e-1c3014aedaf4\">\r\n\r\nEven though this is quickly resolved by running `codesign --sign - ./bitcoind`, the error message does not provide any such directions, and is quite confusing for users.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that we, in order of my preference:\r\n1. ship codesigned binaries by default, and keep unsigned binaries available at https://bitcoincore.org/bin/ for those that need/want it\r\n1. include a README.txt in the tar.gz with codesigning instructions (which cli users should be reasonably used to / familiar with anyway). An install shell script would be an option too but is probably more controversial.\r\n1. add clear instructions on bitcoincore.org and bitcoin.org\r\n\r\nI'm unsure if any similar issues exist for the Windows binaries, but if so, we should probably take a similar approach there (if anyone with a Windows machine can confirm this, that would be great).",

I am a [macOS codesigner](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-detached-sigs/pull/34) and was able to sign a guix-built `bin/bitcoind` release as well as create a detached signature like we do for the gui. However I did so with the Apple-blessed tools (OS keychain and `codesign` command). I was also unable to re-attach that signature to the binary which would be required for guix attestations. So the work involved here would mostly be patching https://github.com/achow101/signapple by @achow101 to operate on flat binaries in addition to bundled packages like Qt, and then in this repository, just updating the guix build/sign/release docs with a few extra steps.",
