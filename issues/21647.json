This seems to create an incomplete wallet state representation, especially in scenarios where pruned nodes need to reconstruct historical wallet activity.\n\nWould extending support to spending transactions require additional validation logic to ensure consistency with existing UTXO tracking and wallet state management?\n\nI am currently exploring how wallet transaction metadata is handled internally, particularly how imported transactions are reconciled with the UTXO set.\n\nAny clarification on the intended architectural constraints around `importprunedfunds` would be very helpful.",
