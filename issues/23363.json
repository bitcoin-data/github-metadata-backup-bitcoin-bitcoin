    "title": "Discussion: Upgrading to C++20",
    "body": "(Previous discussion (C++17): https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16684)\r\n\r\nWith package managers shipping newer versions of compilers and older releases of operating systems going EOL, it occurs that at some point in the future it will be almost uncontroversial to switch to C++20.\r\n\r\nSee the new features here: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support#cpp20\r\n\r\nI think noteworthy are:\r\n\r\n*  <strike>Lambdas in unevaluated contexts: It will be possible to use `Assert(...)` (a lambda) inside another lambda. </strike> (Already fixed by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24714 )\r\n*  <strike>Designated initializers: Named arguments for constructors, see also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20487#discussion_r721997392 </strike> (Already fixed by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24531)\r\n*  std::span: Replacing our `Span`, see also #23226 \r\n* <strike>Epoch for std::chrono: Being able to remove `ChronoSanityCheck` from #21110 </strike>\r\n* <strike>Remove gmtime, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27233#discussion_r1146019853</strike>\r\n* <strike>Some better deduction guides (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/16d698cdcf3c4ef34bae4ccd616d0ddc4a7165d4/src/util/overloaded.h#L18 )</strike>\r\n* \"Key equivalence stuff\" (?) from #19677\r\n* <strike>consteval https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26960#issuecomment-1403565628</strike>\r\n* <strike>concepts https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27927#discussion_r1246430456</strike>\r\n* <strike>https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27401</strike>\r\n* <strike>https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28065#discussion_r1262934214</strike>\r\n* serialize changes: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25284#discussion_r1315550841 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25284#discussion_r1307803451 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23363#issuecomment-1688191282\r\n\r\nOverall this doesn't look like massive improvements, so switching to C++20 is probably low(est) priority.",

      "body": "Given the new build process, it is fairly easy to use a newer compiler, while still targetting older systems, right?\r\n\r\nIf so, I think it makes sense to fairly early on have an optional C++20 mode, and have it enabled in one of the CI targets. This makes sure the source code is C++20 compatible, and perhaps use some C++20 features where possible. It could also be enabled for releases, *if* there is a significant benefit.\r\n\r\nI don't think we want to migrate to have the code _depend_ on C++20 features very soon, as self-compilation on non-cutting-edge systems should remain supported.",

Even if we only want designated initializers, we can't restrict gcc/clang to _only_ permit those, so you could end up in a situation where inadvertently someone introduces a dependency on a C++20 feature that happens to be supported in all compilers used in CI, but not in all compilers we want to support.\r\n\r\nRegarding ranges... yes, but that kind of feature doesn't give us much. Having conditional code that either uses ranges or a fallback, sounds like it'd generally be more complex and error-prone than just not using the ranges interface at all.",

      "body": "> Right, seems fine to keep the assert. I was just thinking that it would be nice to drop it if the compiler can prove it isn't needed. Currently that only works for std::array or `[]` types. However, it doesn't seem to work out of the box for array wrappers, like uint256, whose extent is known at compile time.\r\n\r\nSo, number one, I think you need an helper to implicitly convert a uint256 to a constant-extent span or you'll have to be explicit everywhere:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nclass base_blob\r\n{\r\n...\r\n    constexpr operator std::span<unsigned char,WIDTH>() { return std::span<unsigned char,WIDTH>{*this}; }\r\n    constexpr operator std::span<const unsigned char,WIDTH>() const { return std::span<const unsigned char,WIDTH>{*this}; }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's enough to let you pass a uint256 to something that expects a 32 uchar span:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid foo(std::span<const unsigned char,32> data);\r\nvoid foo_u256(const uint256& num)\r\n{\r\n    foo(num);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Then, to be able to pass a dynamic extent span to the function you probably want a helper to avoid having to repeat the type:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate<size_t N, typename T>\r\nstd::span<T,N> StaticSubSpan(const std::span<T,std::dynamic_extent>& dynspan)\r\n{\r\n    assert(N == dynspan.size());\r\n    return std::span<T,N>(dynspan); // undefined behaviour if N != dynspan.size()\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid foo_var(std::span<const unsigned char> vardata)\r\n{\r\n    assert(vardata.size() == 32);\r\n    // foo(vardata); // NOT OK\r\n    // foo(vardata.subspan(32)); // NOT OK\r\n    // foo(vardata.subspan<32>()); // NOT OK\r\n    foo(StaticSubSpan<32>(vardata)); // OK\r\n    foo(std::span<const unsigned char, 32>(vardata)); // OK; risks undefined behaviour if vardata.size() != 32\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting back on track, if you want to assign a uint256 to a span, you can do that if you're explicit about it being a fixed extent:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nuint256 a_u256{};\r\n\r\nstd::span<const unsigned char,32> b_u256_2{a_u256};\r\nstatic_assert(b_u256_2.extent == 32); // OK\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if you want it to be implicit like it is for `std::array`, then I think you need a deduction guide:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nnamespace std {\r\nspan(uint256& ) -> span<unsigned char, 32>;\r\nspan(const uint256& ) -> span<const unsigned char, 32>;\r\n}\r\nstd::span b_u256_1{a_u256};\r\nstatic_assert(b_u256_1.extent == 32);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I think adding a deduction guide for `std::span` on a custom class is undefined behaviour? https://stackoverflow.com/a/63424897 Maybe there's some way to do that properly? Otherwise, being explicit doesn't seem so bad, especially if we swapped `unsigned char` for `uint8_t`...",
