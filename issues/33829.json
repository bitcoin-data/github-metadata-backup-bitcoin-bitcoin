    "title": "Submission of a Historical & Experiential Report on the Creation of Bitcoin — Request for Dialogue",
    "body": "\nHello Bitcoin Core contributors and community,\n\nMy name is Richard Krause. I’ve prepared a detailed document that combines a historical overview of the birth of Bitcoin and my firsthand account of parallel spiritual and computational frameworks of decentralization, sovereignty, energy circulation, and value.\n\nThe document is titled “Parallel Origins: A Personal Reflection on the Creation of Bitcoin and the Hidden Architecture of Energy and Trust.” It explores the overlap between technological innovation (blockchain, anonymity, decentralization) and an internal system I developed for energy, awareness, and value circulation.\n\nI believe this work could provide an additional layer of insight to the community:\n* into the challenges of anonymous creators instituting systems of value,\n* into how spiritual/energetic models correlate with distributed systems,\n* and into how decentralization both enables freedom and presents vulnerabilities of attribution, control, and legacy.\n\nI would welcome your feedback, any pointers to public discussion threads, or suggestions for how best to present an executive summary or redacted version for broader community review.\nThank you for your time, and for your invaluable work on the protocol.\n\n[Report on Satoshi Nakamoto and the Creation of Bitcoin.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23434945/Report.on.Satoshi.Nakamoto.and.the.Creation.of.Bitcoin.pdf)\n[Parallel Origins- A Personal Reflection on the Creation of Bitcoin….pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23434944/Parallel.Origins-.A.Personal.Reflection.on.the.Creation.of.Bitcoin.pdf)\n[Statement of Testimony.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23434946/Statement.of.Testimony.pdf)\n\nRespectfully,  Richard Krause\n",
