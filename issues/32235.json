      "body": "> If your node is public (probed) then it seems to be too late to hide.\n\nWait. It is not that simple. I guess here you assume that if a node is \"public\" you mean \"is accepting inbound connections\". So, if a node is accepting inbound connections on a clearnet IPv4 address and on a an `.onion` address, then it could have been that a spy has correlated and linked the IPv4 address and the `.onion` address as belonging to the same node. That is true, it is too late to \"hide\" as in un-correlate those.\n\nBut. Tor connections do not have a source address, so the connections made by a node are not linked to its listening `.onion` address. Those outbound connections made by the node, even if without a source address could still be linked to the node (i.e. its IPv4 and `.onion` listening addresses) if the node leaks some information at the application level. Most blatant example is if the node is using a custom user agent string, e.g. \"Jonny's node\" and sends that as the greeting over the IPv4, inbound and outbound Tor connections.\n\nSo, outbound Tor connections are pretty anonymous at the network level (no source address) and if we are careful not to leak information at the application level then it is good for sending our own transactions. Best way to avoid application level leakage is to exchange the bare minimum of messages for sending the transaction - don't send anything extra and ignore incoming messages not related to the transaction send.\n\nIn addition it may happen that the transaction is sent to an adversary. They can hold it and start probing nodes' mempools to see which one has the transaction. So the current behavior of putting the transaction in the mempool upfront has to be changed.\n\nSo, have dedicated broadcast connections that do not leak info at the application level and don't put the transaction in the mempool upfront. This is exactly what https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415 does.\n\n> overengineered mess\n\nThank you for looking into https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415! Concrete ideas into how to simplify things are very much welcome!",

      "body": "@learnwayback, yes, that is what https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415 tries to do, roughly. Now, some details could be different from what you describe, but they are up for discussion and improvement. For example what you describe is to send the transaction to 1 peer whereas https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415 sends to 3 peers \"at once\", right away, without waiting for an outcome. Then it waits to see if the transaction will enter the mempool from the outside and if not, then it retries after 10-15 minutes. These numbers \"3 peers\" and \"10-15 minutes\" are more or less arbitrary, it works with them, will probably work with others as well.\n\nIn my experiments (on mainnet) the transaction comes back in 2-3 seconds, sometimes before the node has completed sending it to all 3 initial peers. In that case, the e.g. 3rd connection is closed by the node before sending the transaction over it because it is not needed anymore. For these \"happy\" scenarios maybe it would be more optimal to send to 1 (or 2?) peer(s), wait a short period of time, e.g. 30 seconds and if not received back then retry to more peers, e.g. 5. That is, start small, optimistic and if it does not work, then increase the number of peers to send to during the retries. This would cause a delay in an \"unhappy\" scenario where the single recipient drops the transaction and does not resend it to the network for whatever reason (they are broken, or malicious or something else).",

In that case, the e.g. 3rd connection is closed by the node before sending the transaction over it because it is not needed anymore\n\nThat is called a side channel information leakage, while it may seem improbable that it could get exploited better not to do it.\n\nDo not alter privacy sensitive behavior based on immediate feedback. Sending twice instead of three times may get correlated with a particular node getting a particular transaction for example.\n\nI would recommend sending to 1 random peer at a time and waiting a random number of seconds before sending it again if it did not come back (while other transactions did).\n\n",
