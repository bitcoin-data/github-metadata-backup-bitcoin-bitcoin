    "title": "Unusual \"Wallet requires newer version\" Error with wallet.dat on macOS, Even with Older Client",
    "body": "### Motivation\n\nI am encountering a persistent \"Wallet requires newer version of Bitcoin Core (code -4)\" error when trying to open my wallet.dat file on macOS. This issue occurs even when attempting to open the wallet with Bitcoin Core version 0.21.0.1, which the debug log from a later version (29.0) indicated was the last client version to interact with the wallet.\nEnvironment:\n * Operating System: macOS 15 \n * Bitcoin Core Version Initially Used: 29.0\n * Bitcoin Core Version Tested (Older): 0.21.0.1\nSteps to Reproduce:\n * Launch Bitcoin Core version 29.0.\n * Bitcoin Core attempts to load the wallet located at /Users/mac/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallets/wallet.dat.\n * The error \"Wallet loading failed. Error loading /Users/mac/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallets/wallet.dat: Wallet requires newer version of Bitcoin Core (code -4)\" is displayed.\n * As per troubleshooting suggestions, Bitcoin Core version 0.21.0.1 was downloaded and installed (after backing up the wallet1.dat file and uninstalling the newer version).\n * Launching Bitcoin Core version 0.21.0.1 resulted in the same \"Wallet requires newer version...\" error.\n * The -rescan command was attempted with version 29.0, and the blockchain synced successfully, but the error persists when trying to load wallet1.dat.\n * The -salvagewallet command was attempted with version 0.21.0.1, and it also resulted in the same \"Wallet requires newer version...\" error.\nRelevant Information from debug.log (from Bitcoin Core version 29.0):\n2025-05-18T05:53:16Z Using wallet /Users/mac/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallets/wallet1.dat\n2025-05-18T05:53:16Z init message: Loading wallet…\n2025-05-18T05:53:16Z [wallet.dat] Wallet file version = 10500, last client version = 210201\n2025-05-18T05:53:16Z [wallet.dat] Releasing wallet wallet.dat..\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe wallet should load successfully, especially with the Bitcoin Core version (0.21.0.1) that the log indicates last used it.\nActual Behavior:\nThe wallet fails to load with a \"newer version required\" error across multiple client versions, including the one that supposedly last used it.\nPossible Implications:\nThis behavior might indicate:\n * A bug in how Bitcoin Core handles certain types of wallet corruption or metadata.\n * An inaccurate reporting of the \"last client version\" in the debug log.\n * A fundamental incompatibility issue that isn't being correctly identified.\nRequest:\nCould the developers investigate this unusual behavior? The persistent \"newer version required\" error even with an older client version suggests a deeper issue that might affect other users in unexpected scenarios. Any insights or potential fixes would be greatly appreciated.\nAdditional Context:\n * The user (me) does not have any backups of the wallet.dat file or a recovery phrase.\n\n### Possible solution\n\nPossible update the qt framework to 6 and release a new version of Bitcoin core sooner than expected.\n\n### Useful Skills\n\n* Compiling Bitcoin Core from source\n* Running the C++ unit tests and the Python functional tests\n* ...\n\n\n### Guidance for new contributors\n\nWant to work on this issue?\n\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\n",

My recommendation would be to not use salvagewallet, unless you know you have no backups and you know that the wallet file is corrupt. Otherwise, it can create more issues than it fixes.\n\nGenerally, BDB wallets are deprecated anyway and you'll have to migrate them longer term, so my recommendation would be to try to `migratewallet` your wallet file (or any of the backups) to a descriptor wallet. Once that succeeds, check your transaction history, coins and balance and create a fresh backup, if everything matches your expectations.",
