    "title": "RFC: Replacing Boost Process",
    "body": "Boost Process is currently relatively poorly maintained; bugs are remaining unfixed for multiple Boost releases, the code and issue tracking is [confusingly](https://github.com/boostorg/process/pull/243) spread across multiple repositories, see https://github.com/boostorg/process/ and https://github.com/klemens-morgenstern/boost-process), which themselves each have different versions of the code.\r\n\r\nThere's been no recent \"modernization\" of the module, i.e an option use `std::filesystem` over `boost::filesystem`, like other Boost modules, which is why we no-longer support external signing on Windows, see #24065. \r\n\r\nIt's inclusion in our project is also a downside to our Boost consolidation / removal, i.e #24742, as Process's own dependencies (filesystem, system, win-api, + others) pull in even more Boost modules (i.e asio), which in turn pull in further modules..\r\n\r\nIf we are going to continue to use/expand our usage of it, I think we need some sort of plan, addressing the above, rather than leaving it ignored while we start accumulating workarounds, i.e #24523, in our own code to support it, and it's presence potentially blocks other project goals.\r\n\r\nOne potential alternative is https://github.com/arun11299/cpp-subprocess.",

      "body": "FWIW, I started working on replacing boost::process with cpp-subprocess on the following branch: https://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/tree/nuke_boost_process\r\nCurrently the unit tests (system_tests/run_command) and functional tests (rpc_signer.py, wallet_signer.py) pass on both Linux and OpenBSD, but compiling for Windows via g++-mingw-w64-x86-64-posix fails due to missing headers (`Windows.h`). The changes are not very invasive, most work was probably to change from passing a single string to a list of arguments.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is motivated to continue the work or maybe just want to evaluate if cpp-subprocess is a proper replacement candidate, feel free to take the commits. I'm currently not running any Windows system where I could even test the changes, the best I can do is to cross-compile (which as said above, doesn't even work yet) and run the unit tests via Wine. cpp-subprocess' README.md says:\r\n> Support for Windows is limited at this time. Please report any specific use-cases that fail, and they will be fixed as they are reported.\r\n\r\nso there are likely more changes needed to make everything work as expected.",

Only the final `WSACleanup` function call performs the actual cleanup. The preceding calls simply decrement an internal reference count in the WS2_32.DLL.\r\n\r\nThat is not the case for our unit tests because the `SetupNetworking()` call is a part of the `BasicTestingSetup` fixture and is invoked multiple times, while `~CNetCleanup()` is invoked once only, at the end of the test binary execution.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes Winsock DLL initialization and termination.\r\n\r\nMore docs:\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/initializing-winsock\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsastartup\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsacleanup\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28940.",

          "body": "It's come to light that Boost ASIO (a Boost Process sub dep) has in some\r\ninstances, been quietly  initialising our network stack on Windows (see\r\nPR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28486 and discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28940).\r\n\r\nThis has been shielding a bug in our own code, but the larger issue\r\nis that Boost Process/ASIO is running code before main, and doing things\r\nlike setting up networking. This undermines our own assumptions about\r\nhow our binary works, happens before we run any sanity checks,\r\nand before we call our own code to setup networking. Note that ASIO also\r\ncalls WSAStartup with version `2.0`, whereas we call with `2.2`.\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear why a feature like external signer would have a\r\ndependency that would be doing anything network/socket related,\r\ngiven it only exists to spawn a local process.\r\n\r\nSee also the discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24907. Note that the maintaince of Boost Process in general,\r\nhas not really improved. For example, rather than fixing bugs like https://github.com/boostorg/process/issues/111, \r\ni.e, https://github.com/boostorg/process/pull/317, the maintainer chooses to just wrap exception causing overflows\r\nin try-catch blocks: https://github.com/boostorg/process/commit/0c42a58eacab6a96b19196e399307bad8a938a27. These changes get merged in large,\r\nunreviewed PRs, i.e https://github.com/boostorg/process/pull/319.\r\n\r\nThis PR disables external-signer on Windows for now. If, in future, someone\r\nchanges how Boost Process works, or replaces it entirely with some\r\nproperly reviewed and maintained code, we could reenable this feature on\r\nWindows.",

I remember that Boost has something like this... ah, yes: [Boost::Process](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/doc/html/process.html); and perhaps there still other options.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if you could compare and contrast your library with these alternatives, to help users decide what's a better fit for them. Remember that many/most C++ developers don't have experience with Python 2.7's subprocess facilities/library, so we don't automatically know what's offered.\r\n\r\nThis would fit nicely inside the README, or possibly a Wiki page here on GitHub with a link from the README.",
