For example, it's not scalable or reasonable to configure backup tools or cache cleanup tools when each application takes it upon itself to decide on a unique place to put configuration, caches, or shared files. Users have either already gone out of their way to tell apps where they prefer things to go by setting the XDG environment variables, or they don't care and won't mind them going there by default.\r\n\r\nApps that respect the XDG standard allow me to say \"back up $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, a single directory, thereby ignoring binaries, shared files, or cached data that can be recreated by the app if it's not there\" instead of specifying a snowflake path for every application I use.\r\n\r\nThere isn't any downside to respecting users' preferences. If you personally want everything in `$HOME`, the standard allows you to do that, but I don't see why anyone prefers that except by sheer weight of historical momentum.",

      "body": "> I don't think anything in the datadir qualifies as \"cache\", so at most we could split it up between `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_DATA_HOME`.\r\n\r\nThis is a great place to start because Bitcoin-Qt already uses `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/{Bitcoin/Bitcoin-Qt.conf,autostart/bitcoin.desktop}`.\r\n\r\n> I see `db.log`, `debug.log`, ...\r\n\r\nThese go in `$XDG_STATE_HOME`.\r\n\r\n>The $XDG_STATE_HOME contains state data that should persist between (application) restarts, but that is not important or portable enough to the user that it should be stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME. It may contain:\r\n> - actions history (**logs**, history, recently used files, …)\r\n> - current state of the application that can be reused on a restart (view, layout, open files, undo history, …)\r\n\r\n> `.lock` and `.walletlock,` these could go on `XDG_CACHE_HOME`.\r\n\r\nThese go in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.\r\n\r\n> This directory is designed for storing runtime files such as sockets, named pipes, and lock files. The files in this directory are usually ephemeral and should be deleted when the user session ends.\r\n\r\n`XDG_CACHE_HOME` is for non-essential files that should persist restart. \r\n\r\n>maybe we should set [`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`], if it's not set so that that conf file goes into the bitcoin data directory too?\r\n\r\nNACK, Bitcoin-Qt needs to know where to look for a custom Data directory (on a removable drive for instance), if you move `Bitcoin-Qt.conf` to the custom Datadir it will ask for its location every start up.\r\n\r\n> if not, maybe we should mention this env var and conf file location in the docs somewhere.\r\n\r\nACK, we technically do (if you dig through the links) but not directly enough to quickly find all the default locations Bitcoin-Qt makes files from our `doc/files.md`.\r\n\r\n> `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`\r\n\r\nShould we capitalize `Bitcoin/` to avoid creating a new folder by matching capitalization of the existing folder Bitcoin-Qt?\r\n\r\n`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` is a great place to look for an unspecified -conf file. This would tidy up my systems quite a lot. As is, I have to make a ~/.bitcoin folder with my bitcoin.conf simply to direct the application to my custom datadir. Cluttering my home folder.\r\n\r\n`settings.json` also belongs in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bitcoin`\r\n\r\n> A question: should we use `$XDG_DATA_HOME` (`$HOME/.local/share`) or `$XDG_STATE_HOME` (`$HOME/.local/state`) for the datadir?\r\n\r\n`$XDG_STATE_HOME` is intended for storing state information that is specific to a user and should persist restarts...\r\n\r\n> but that is not important or portable enough to the user that it should be stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME.\r\n\r\nThe datadir goes in `$XDG_DATA_HOME` because it is portable and important: wallets.\r\n\r\n#### Regarding whether `blocks` and `chainstate` are` $XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `$XDG_DATA_HOME`:\r\n\r\n`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` is analogous to `/var/cache/` from FHS:\r\n\r\n> /var/cache is intended for cached data from applications. Such data is locally generated as a result of time-consuming I/O or calculation. The application must be able to regenerate or restore the data. Unlike /var/spool, the cached files can be deleted without data loss. The data must remain valid between invocations of the application and rebooting the system.\r\n>\r\n> Files located under /var/cache may be expired in an application specific manner, by the system administrator, or both. The application must always be able to recover from manual deletion of these files (generally because of a disk space shortage). No other requirements are made on the data format of the cache directories.\r\n\r\nI see the argument they can be recreated or fetched for `chainstate` but I do NOT see this argument for `blocks`. We would lose all our bitcoins if everyone deleted their `blocks` folder, since this is peer-to-peer software we all need to back it up. However, if everyone deleted their chainstate folder, a full node can recreate the data rather quickly.\r\n\r\n`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/bitcoin/chainstate` and `$XDG_DATA_HOME/bitcoin/blocks` is my vote. However for pruned nodes it should be `$XDG_DATA_HOME/bitcoin/chainstate` as the Software can no longer recreate this folder.\r\n\r\nAnd for AssumeUTXO with prune=0 put the snapshot chainstate in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/bitcoin/` and the snapshot blocks in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/bitcoin/.\r\n\r\n> The /var/cache directory contains cached files, i.e. files that were generated and can be re-generated any time, but they are worth storing to save time of recomputing them.\r\n>\r\n>Any application can create a file or directory here. It is assumed that files stored here are not critical, so the system can delete the contents of /var/cache either periodically, or when its contents get too large.\r\n>\r\n>**Any application should take into account that the file stored here can disappear any time, and be ready to recompute its contents (with some time penalty).**\r\n\r\nI believe chainstate belongs in  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` when `prune=0` it best fits these requirements. With `prune` set, it must go in `$XDG_DATA_HOME` as it cannot be locally regenerated.\r\n\r\n#### Should our subdir be `Bitcoin` or `bitcoin`?\r\n\r\n`Bitcoin` is consistent with the current `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Bitcoin/Bitcoin-qt.conf` but `bitcoin` matches our current `$HOME/.bitcoin` datadir and `.desktop` files and is easier to type.",
