    "title": "rpc: getrawtransaction lookup by witness txid",
    "body": "For Stratum v2 custom job declaration to be bandwidth efficient, the pool can request[^0] only the transactions that it doesn't know about.\n\nThe spec doesn't specify how this is achieved, but one method is to call `getrawtransaction` on each of the transaction ids listed in [DeclareMiningJob](https://stratumprotocol.org/specification/06-Job-Declaration-Protocol?query=DeclareMiningJob#644-declareminingjob-client-server) (or a subset if the pool software maintains a cache).\n\nUnfortunately this RPC only supports `txid`, not `wtxid`.\n\nI think the easiest change would be:\n- have `getrawtransaction` accept either `txid` or `wtxid` as the first _positional_ argument\n- add a `GetTransaction` that takes a `Wtxid`\n- try with `Txid` first, `Wtxid` if that fails\n- optionally add a \"hash_type\" argument: `txid`, `txid` or `*`\n\nSee also:\n- https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/issues/170\n\n[^0]: there's two reasons the pool requests these transactions: to approve the template and to broadcast the block if a solution is found (the miner will also broadcast via their template provider) ",

Having a method to do that without asking to the miner is very helpful.  The Job Declarator Server could use the IPC interface, but I don't see why this should not be possible trough the RPC interface. And as an implementor I prefer to use RPC for  Job Declarator Server since IPC is very new and I don't need it if I have this in RPC.\n\nhttps://stratumprotocol.org/specification",
