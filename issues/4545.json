    "title": "Comparison tool successor?",
    "body": "The current comparison tool tests network behavior that is too specific - in particular, it seems hard to adapt it to headers-first (which in some cases does not fetch blocks in the same order, e.g. because it already knows that it's invalid through the header, even though at every point it should have the same best block) - correct me if I'm wrong, @TheBlueMatt.\n\nOne of the reasons is that the current comparison both incorporates the scenario of comparisons to run, and the logic to compare it to (BitcoinJ full node code). This makes it hard to adapt.\n\nI propose writing a tool that does nothing but implement a testing scenario, and run it against 2 bitcoind's in parallel: an old trusted version, and the new version to be tested, and compares whether at every point in time (after synchronizing through a ping/ping) they agree on the best chain.\n\nThis could be as simple as a python node with an associated block database and block header tree, that can answer getdata/getheaders/getblocks, and runs through a scripted scenario, but doesn't do any validation itself.\n",

          "title": "Python P2P testing framework",
          "body": "Motivated by the discussion in #4545, I've been working on building a python testing framework that will allow us to write tests that exercise the p2p code in bitcoind, so that we can perform end-to-end testing and perform comparisons of behavior across bitcoind versions. This code builds on the existing RPC testing functionality, so that tests using both RPC calls and p2p messages can be written.\n\nI've split this pull into 3 commits to try to make this easier to review.\n\n1) The first commit adds a file called mininode.py, which I grabbed from jgarzik's mini-node branch of the pynode repository, and modified. This file does a few things:\n- Defines a class, NodeConn, which manages connectivity to a bitcoin node.\n- Defines a callback prototype, NodeConnCB, which is used for message delivery. The idea is that you can write a class that inherits from NodeConnCB and pass it in to a NodeConn object, and then be notified when events of interest arrive.\n- Defines all the data structures from bitcoin core that pass over the network, eg CBlock, CTransaction, etc.\n- Defines all the serialization/deserialization code.\n\nIt's possible to write (crude) tests using mininode.py alone, if you want. Also, mininode supports testing outside of regtest (it can communicate on testnet and mainnet as well), so that theoretically allows for a broader category of testing than we currently can do. All the tests I've been working on have been focused on regtest, however.\n\nAlso, in the first commit, I provide one example test (maxblocksinflight.py) that shows how you can use mininode. This is largely a proof-of-concept example, but it does test something useful: 0.10 used to fail this test until #5507 was merged.\n\n2) The second commit adds support for a comparison-tool style testing framework, similar to the comparison-tool framework that we use from bitcoinj in the pull-tester. The code in this commit is designed to add structure to test writing, so that tests are both easier to read and write (compared to the free-form structure of maxblocksinflight.py). I include in this commit one example test written using the framework, which tests the processing of two different types of invalid blocks.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that I use py-leveldb in blockstore.py, a file I introduced in this commit that provides disk-backed storage for blocks.  I think I had to manually install that package on my machine, so I wanted to flag this dependency in case others think this would be a problem.\n\n3) The third commit adds some script processing routines (script.py and its dependency, bignum.py -- the latter could probably be removed with a little work) which I have copied and modified from python-bitcoinlib. With these additional tools, I was able to write a test, script_test.py, which reads all the script tests from the unit test data directory (script_valid.json and script_invalid.json) and inserts them in blocks delivered to two nodes, and for each test case compares whether the nodes agree on whether the block containing the test transaction passes consensus checks. This test is very slow (perhaps 40 minutes to run), so this is largely a proof of concept that demonstrates the kinds of tests we ought to be able to write. (Unfortunately, this test makes use of RPC calls that only have existed since 0.10, so it is not possible to run this test in its current form to compare 0.9-or-older versions).\n\nIf this framework looks okay, then I think a future project would be to re-implement the pull-tester's comparison test in this framework.  \n\nI realize this is a lot of code, so if there's anything more I can do to aid in review please let me know.\n",

      "body": "Hello. Just FYI, I ended up poking around the Core code recently and saw the comparison tool. While poking around and trying to troubleshoot some stuff, I discovered that [comparison tool support seems to have been dropped from the forthcoming v0.14](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/commit/1eaf05cacf35ebdf8e716eb84f0d5d0c051b3398). For that matter, v0.13.6 doesn't work without a [one-line fix](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/issues/1236#issuecomment-202777012), and even then, I've seen an intermittent DB error that I can't reproduce right now.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to add that here in case this is still on anybody's radar. My Java experience is limited, and it sounds like nobody's really happy with the tool anyway, so I'm really not the right person to tackle this project. Besides, I don't think there will be a v0.13.7 release, so as things stand, the tool is completely broken.\n\n**EDIT**: [There might be a v0.13.7 after all](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/issues/1236#issuecomment-207735553). Not sure if the aforementioned fix would make it in but I'll ask for it.\n",

From https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4545#issuecomment-209938408:\n\n> Seems I'll just have to set a deadline: I'm going to remove use of the unmaintained java-based comparison framework after the 0.13 branch-off (projected  2016-07-06, see #7679). I hope the Python framework will be a full replacement by then, but as this is holding up progress in other areas, that will not affect the decision.\n\n@MarcoFalke worded it quite well too:\n\n> If they don't and no one knows how to fix, we can remove them right now. Because the only thing they'd be doing then, is slowing down travis.\n- The effort of porting the java comparison tool to Python is going very well, see e.g. #8141. If there is something left to do, I'm sure it can be resolved before the 0.14 release.\n- The test is blocking changes such as #7093 (Address mempool information leak and resource wasting attacks).\n- This test takes quite a while and is holding up enabling the tests for win32: #8227.\n-  [comparison tool support seems to have been dropped from the v0.14](https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/commit/1eaf05cacf35ebdf8e716eb84f0d5d0c051b3398) release of bitcoinj (discovered @droark)\n\nThis removes all the support for the tool, and removes it from depends (and hopefully all other references to it).\n\nNot to be backported to 0.13.\n",

The Java comparison tool was finally removed in #8504.\r\n\r\nThe python comparison test framework was originally intended to start multiple bitcoind nodes on different versions, send various blocks/transactions to those nodes, and compare that the nodes reach the same state. However, the tests are now usually run through the test_runner.py framework with only one node being run. The comparison part of the comparison test framework is not even used.\r\n\r\nTests written in the 'comparison' style make use of `TestManager` and `TestInstance` classes and yield statements throughout the test. The framework is overly complex and not flexible enough to be really useful. In addition, they're difficult to write, understand, update and troubleshoot. There are only 7 tests which use the comparison test style - we should rewrite them in the regular BitcoinTestFramework style.\r\n\r\n## subtasks\r\n\r\n- [x] Convert bip65-cltv-p2p.py to use the BitcoinTestFramework (#10695)\r\n- [x] Convert bipdersig-p2p.py to use the BitcoinTestFramework (#10695)\r\n- [x] Convert invalidtxrequest.py to use the BitcoinTestFramework (#11771)\r\n- [x] Convert p2p_invalid_block.py to use the BitcoinTestFramework (#11772)\r\n- [x] Convert feature_block.py to use the BitcoinTestFramework (#11773)\r\n- [x] Convert feature_csv_activation.py to use the BitcoinTestFramework (#11817)\r\n- [x] Delete redundant feature_bip9_softforks.py (#11818)\r\n- [x] Remove the ComparisonTestFramework code (#11818)",
