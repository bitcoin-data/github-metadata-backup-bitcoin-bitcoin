      "body": "> I'm not sure if `waitTipChanged` and `waitNext` can handle being interrupted before their timeouts yet, from either side\n\nThey are supposed to be handle it because they wait on `kernel_notifications.m_tip_block_cv` and `chainman.m_interrupt` which should both get signaled on shutdown.\n\nClient should also not need to do anything on shutdown and should just be disconnected.\n\nFrom the log it seems like ctrl-c is being processed, and shutdown is proceeding all the way up to the \"Shutdown down\" message, and then maybe the process is hanging? If so that's pretty interesting because there is no code after that in the Shutdown() function, and no code after that in the main() function calling Shutdown(), so it must mean there is some hang in some a destructor.\n\nMost useful thing to debug would be a stack trace, which you could get by running the process under GDB and running `thread apply all bt`. There was also another shutdown bug reported https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33387 and which my suggested patch could potentially address, or at least provide some more debug information. Other things to try might be running with `-debug=ipc` to log IPC calls and trying to stop the node with `bitcoin-cli stop` to see if the effect is the same as with ctrl-c\n\n",

It's also good to know the problem doesn't happen with waitNext, only waitTipChanged since we can look for differences between those methods.",

      "body": "Have been trying to reproduce this bug in python by calling waitTipChanged followed by a shutdown but so far no luck.\n\nWith no `await asyncio.sleep` after `waitTipChanged` and before `stop_node` I get a \"peer disconnected\" error. With `await asyncio.sleep(0)` I get a \"broken pipe\" error, and with longer sleeps I see a nullopt BlockRef returned from waitTipChanged(). \n\nThese results are all expected, and I didn't see a way to make the node hang on shutdown. Changes made to interface_ipc.py are shown in the diff below.\n\nI also tried to analyze the two posted log files. The first log file shows a waitTipChanged call being made and apparently never returning when the node shuts down. There is no \"IPC server destroy\" log line for the Mining interface object in the logs, and only the Init and BlockTemplate objects are shown to be destroyed. This is consistent with the Mining.waitTipChanged method hanging somehow and never returning.\n\nThe second log file seems to show the rust client calling waitTipChanged in a loop during shutdown, and waitTipChanged returning an empty response with the [`result: Common.BlockRef`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d41b503ae128ac36ef27e652d2935c6fe7981a79/src/ipc/capnp/mining.capnp#L19) field unset. This is expected because it just means the c++ waitTipChanged method returned nullopt during shutdown as [documented](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d41b503ae128ac36ef27e652d2935c6fe7981a79/src/interfaces/mining.h#L102).
