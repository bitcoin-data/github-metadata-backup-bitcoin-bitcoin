      "body": "> I'm not sure if `waitTipChanged` and `waitNext` can handle being interrupted before their timeouts yet, from either side\n\nThey are supposed to be handle it because they wait on `kernel_notifications.m_tip_block_cv` and `chainman.m_interrupt` which should both get signaled on shutdown.\n\nClient should also not need to do anything on shutdown and should just be disconnected.\n\nFrom the log it seems like ctrl-c is being processed, and shutdown is proceeding all the way up to the \"Shutdown down\" message, and then maybe the process is hanging? If so that's pretty interesting because there is no code after that in the Shutdown() function, and no code after that in the main() function calling Shutdown(), so it must mean there is some hang in some a destructor.\n\nMost useful thing to debug would be a stack trace, which you could get by running the process under GDB and running `thread apply all bt`. There was also another shutdown bug reported https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33387 and which my suggested patch could potentially address, or at least provide some more debug information. Other things to try might be running with `-debug=ipc` to log IPC calls and trying to stop the node with `bitcoin-cli stop` to see if the effect is the same as with ctrl-c\n\n",

It's also good to know the problem doesn't happen with waitNext, only waitTipChanged since we can look for differences between those methods.",

      "body": "Have been trying to reproduce this bug in python by calling waitTipChanged followed by a shutdown but so far no luck.\n\nWith no `await asyncio.sleep` after `waitTipChanged` and before `stop_node` I get a \"peer disconnected\" error. With `await asyncio.sleep(0)` I get a \"broken pipe\" error, and with longer sleeps I see a nullopt BlockRef returned from waitTipChanged(). \n\nThese results are all expected, and I didn't see a way to make the node hang on shutdown. Changes made to interface_ipc.py are shown in the diff below.\n\nI also tried to analyze the two posted log files. The first log file shows a waitTipChanged call being made and apparently never returning when the node shuts down. There is no \"IPC server destroy\" log line for the Mining interface object in the logs, and only the Init and BlockTemplate objects are shown to be destroyed. This is consistent with the Mining.waitTipChanged method hanging somehow and never returning.\n\nThe second log file seems to show the rust client calling waitTipChanged in a loop during shutdown, and waitTipChanged returning an empty response with the [`result: Common.BlockRef`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d41b503ae128ac36ef27e652d2935c6fe7981a79/src/ipc/capnp/mining.capnp#L19) field unset. This is expected because it just means the c++ waitTipChanged method returned nullopt during shutdown as [documented](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d41b503ae128ac36ef27e652d2935c6fe7981a79/src/interfaces/mining.h#L102). The client should probably handle this by shutting down itself.\n\n<details><summary>diff</summary>\n<p>\n\n```diff\n--- a/test/functional/interface_ipc.py\n+++ b/test/functional/interface_ipc.py\n@@ -124,8 +124,30 @@ class IPCInterfaceTest(BitcoinTestFramework):\n             assert_equal(len(newblockref.result.hash), block_hash_size)\n             assert_equal(newblockref.result.height, current_block_height + 1)\n             self.log.debug(\"Wait for timeout\")\n-            wait = mining.result.waitTipChanged(ctx, newblockref.result.hash, timeout)\n-            oldblockref = await wait\n+\n+            async def wait_tip_changed():\n+                return await mining.result.waitTipChanged(ctx, newblockref.result.hash, timeout)\n+\n+            wait = asyncio.create_task(wait_tip_changed())\n+            #await asyncio.sleep(0)\n+            #await asyncio.sleep(0.1)\n+            self.nodes[0].stop_node()\n+            try:\n+                oldblockref = await wait\n+            except capnp.lib.capnp.KjException as e:\n+                if \"disconnected: Peer disconnected\" in e.message:\n+                    self.log.debug(\"Success: peer disconnected\")\n+                    return\n+                if \"disconnected: message = [Errno 32] Broken pipe\" in e.message:\n+                    self.log.debug(\"Success: broken pipe\")\n+                    return\n+                raise\n+\n+            if not oldblockref._has(\"result\"):\n+                self.log.debug(\"Success: waitTipChanged returned nullopt\")\n+                return\n+            raise AssertionError(f\"Expected broken pipe not {oldblockref.result=!r}\")\n+\n             assert_equal(len(newblockref.result.hash), block_hash_size)\n             assert_equal(oldblockref.result.hash, newblockref.result.hash)\n             assert_equal(oldblockref.result.height, newblockref.result.height)\n```\n</p>\n</details>\n\nSince it seems not straightforward to reproduce this problem this makes me think it could be a race condition that the patch from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33387 is more likely to fix\n",

      "body": "Thanks! Output from LLDB shows what the problem is and suggests this should be fixed by the patch in #33387, which I will go ahead and make into a PR.\n\nIn the stack trace (which I annotated below):\n\n- Thread 1 is the bitcoin node main thread, and it is just waiting for the IPC event loop thread to exit.\n- Thread 3 is IPC event loop thread, and it is idle waiting for new I/O events.\n- Thread 38 is an IPC worker thread calling `WaitTipChanged`, which is stuck calling `kernel_notifications.m_tip_block_cv.wait_until()` waiting for shutdown to be signaled or the chain tip to change. This shows buggy behavior, because by this point thread 1 will have already destroyed the kernel notification and `m_tip_block_cv` objects.\n- Thread 39 is the IPC asynchronous cleanup thread and it is just idle, waiting for new cleanup callbacks to be added or for the event loop to exit.\n\nThe patch in #33387 should fix the problem with thread 38 using objects already destroyed by thread 1, by making the `disconnectIncoming()` call in Thread 1 wait for thread 38 to exit before proceeding further with shutdown. (Specifically, `disconnectIncoming` will delete the IPC server `mp::Connection` object associated with the client, and destroy the `ProxyServer<Thread>` object, waiting for the worker thread to exit in that destructor.)\n\nI am still unsure why I couldn't reproduce this problem with the python tests I tried to write https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33463#issuecomment-3330765943, and also why the problem did not seem to happen when you called stop RPC instead of using ctrl-c. I was looking more closely at shutdown code and think it may have to do with ctrl-c handler `HandleSIGTERM` only triggering the `g_shutdown` shutdown signal, not triggering `m_tip_block_cv` as the `stop` RPC seems to do via the `NodeContext::shutdown_request` callback. Knowing this could help write a test to reproduce the problem, which would be good because even if I think the patch in #33387 fixes it, it would be good to have confirmation.\n\n<details><summary>annotated stack

Like I mentioned previously, it's already outdated since I'm no longer making usage of `waitTipChanged` (and many other parts have also evolved).\n\nSo this repo is pretty much useless, only created for the purpose of reproducing the issue I reported here.\n\nhttps://github.com/plebhash/sv2-bitcoin-core",
