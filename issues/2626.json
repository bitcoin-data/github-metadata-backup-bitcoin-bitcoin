The result of someone hijacking github, controlling people's connections, or holding one of the developers with access at gunpoint could be very problematic. Of course, that problem exists now too, but without mechanism to explicitly push out new releases, such an attempt would be delayed significantly.\n\nThe plan for auto-updating involved requiring several independent signatures from developers (and perhaps others), including the ability to sign a message against a particular version. This would make such an attack much harder, but also complicates the implementation of an auto-update scheme.\n",

      "body": "@drak With your simple implementation there is the problem of bitcoin.org still not supporting HTTPS, so it would be trivial to MITM. This is not so much a problem for the version notice itself, but if you refer them to that site to download a new version they will download a potentially infected client from the attacker. \n\nI remember some FinFisher scandal in which they pushed fake updates (to some software already on the user's computer) to install malware, so this threat is not hypothetical.  And even with SSL it would still be relying on a single point of failure...\n\nFor any auto-update, the client has to do the downloading + dev signature verification at least. Installation should be left to the user voluntarily (ie, \"this is the list of changes, click here if you want to upgrade\") .\n\nMaybe we could use a form of signing that does not require a complete GPG to be packaged? Or is there some lightweight library that allows verifying GPG signatures?\n",

But without developers and \"bitcoin official\" private keys, hacked binaries will not get installed\n-> Someone could compromise a binary at sourceforge, etc. But it wont get installed because of invalid binary hashes.\n-> Someone changes local installed public keys (trojan) and also changes the RSS feed (by hacking the installed binary and changing the RSS URL or compromising the remote RSS Feed).\n\nMITM should not be possible (or at least they would need a lot of effort).\n\nDeployment:\n-> when having a final RC, the releasemanager could send the binary to different developers to get the signature in return. The signature then must be included in the RSS feed.\n\nProblems:\n-> The deployment process might gets more complex.\n",

If such a notification would be shown once per new version (ignoring RC) and assuming there is no large-scale version faking (from which no one would benefit) that alert would come up every 1-2 month (based on recent releases). Not that much of a nuisance I think.\n",
