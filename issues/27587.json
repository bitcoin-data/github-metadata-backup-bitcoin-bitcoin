    "title": "Bitcoin Kernel Library Project Tracking",
    "body": "#### Project Board for pull requests past and present: https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/projects/3\n\nThis is the tracking issue for the bitcoin kernel library (`libbitcoinkernel`) project.\n\nThe bitcoin kernel project extracts Bitcoin Core's consensus engine. The kernel part of the name highlights one of the key functional differences from the deprecated libbitcoinconsensus and in fact, most libraries: it is a stateful library that can spawn threads, do caching, do I/O, and many other things that one may not normally expect from a library.\n\n`libbitcoinkernel` could also be used as an internal library for `libbitcoin_node`. The desired library organization is shown in [doc/design/libraries.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/libraries.md). This is attempted in #28690. \n\nThe statefulness is necessary for the bitcoin kernel's decidedly incremental approach to extracting our consensus engine. This approach favors:\n\n1. Reusing existing code\n...which allows us to be continually integrated with Bitcoin Core and benefit from our extensive test suite\n\n2. Incremental decoupling instead of building from scratch\n ...which allows us to avoid having to prematurely optimize for a \"perfect\" boundary or API (tends to be highly subjective, non-obvious, may lead to unproductive bike-shedding before any meaningful work gets done)\n\n## Areas with open work\n\n### Developing an API for the library\n\nHeaders installed alongside the library should define a safe and stable interface for its users. Currently a C header provides support for validating scripts and blocks, as well as reading from the block store [bitcoinkernel.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.h). This should be expanded over time to provide more features and flexibility to users.\n\nThe headers have bindings in:\n* Python https://github.com/stickies-v/py-bitcoinkernel\n* Rust https://github.com/theCharlatan/rust-bitcoinkernel\n* Go https://github.com/stringintech/go-bitcoinkernel\n* Java https://github.com/yuvicc/java-bitcoinkernel/tree/master\n* C# / dotnet https://github.com/janb84/BitcoinKernel.NET/tree/main\n\nMore bindings would be desirable for the following categories:\n* Application developers and systems engineers (Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Zig, Haskell, Clojure, Javascript etc.)\n* Data analysis and research (R, Julia etc.)\n* Data queries (e.g. PostgreSQL external data etc)\n\nSome work has also been done for expanding the current API, including:\n* Script debugging: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commits/kernelApi_Script/\n* Header validation: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33822\n* Precomputed transaction data handling: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33891\n* Context-free block validation: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33908\n* Validating blocks without a chainstate: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/kernelApi_nochainstate\n* Context free transaction checks: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33796\n* Stateful transaction validation: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/kernelApiNode\n\nThe current API defined through the C header only has very rudimentary error handling. While it attempts to follow the philosophy that errors arising from unsanitized user input are programming errors, it does surface more concrete information on validation failures, as well as errors that arise from problems with the underlying system. These are referred to as fatal errors. The current Bitcoin Core code does not always surface these fatal errors to the caller. #29642 attempts to surface this error information directly.\n\nIt is also currently not possible to instantiate multiple kernel validation objects and distinguish between their log messages. The library currently only has a global logger. \n\n* A potential solution is #30342\n* There is also an issue for discussion: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/34062\n\n### Read-only kernel clients\n\nThe kernel library provides the functionality to read Bitcoin Core's data, like blocks, headers, and undo data, directly from disk without additional overhead. External applications like Electrs and Esplora parse block.dat files directly for index building. This is problematic because Bitcoin Core's block storage is internal and provides no guarantees for external consumers. Reading this data directly can give these guarantees, as well as improve performance, since the block store might contain invalid blocks, or blocks from dead forks.\n\nThe current drawback to this approach is that leveldb, which stores the block tree and the chainstate, does not allow for readers in parallel processes. Bitcoin Core therefore has to shutdown before an external process using the kernel library can read its data. A pull request moving the block tree database from leveldb to a simple hand-rolled format, which would allow reading the data in parallel, was opened in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32427.\n\nA summary of how the kernel library might be used for reading data is provided [here](https://github.com/alexanderwiederin/bitcoinkernel-blockreader). Applications building on #32427 could validate this architecture as well as provide benchmarks for this approach over using Bitcoin Core's existing interfaces to read block data.\n\n### Context-minimal validation\n\nThe current design of the library includes all the Bitcoin Core specific data storage methods. Alternative clients wishing to validate blocks therefore have to build the chain block-by-block and have to re-use the UTXO model.\n\nHowever there exist projects and proposed alternative data models like utreexo, [swift sync](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/a61a37d14182ccd78760e477c78133cd), [UHS](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CAApLimjfPKDxmiy_SHjuOKbfm6HumFPjc9EFKvw=3NwZO8JcmQ@mail.gmail.com/), and libbitcoin, that do not require a UTXO set for validation, but could still profit from re-using Bitcoin Core's Block validation code. [Floresta](https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta), a utreexo implementation, and a project working on swiftsync have voiced strong desire for these features.\n\nThere are a few possible directions to take here, including:\n* Abstracting data readers and writers (e.g. an abstract block store: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/blockstoreReaderWriter)\n* Making validation functions require less context (e.g. stop passing the utxo step to validation functions: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32317)\n* Reducing the `cs_main` lock scope (e.g. reducing locking during `AcceptBlock` https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/accept_block_reduce_lock)\n* Exposing more validation functions, like `CheckBlock`, `AcceptBlock`, etc.\n* Validation functions that only use the block tree, but don't persist chainstate and block data\n\nContext-minimal validation might also be interesting for SPV clients, which wish to re-use only a subset of validation.\n\n### `cs_main` split\n\nCurrently the `cs_main` recursive mutex protects not only the bulk of validation-specific mutable state, but also state in net processing. Ideally validation would have its own mutexes, that do not have to be shared with other functionality. Function calls requiring a lock to be held as a pre-condition to ensure consistent state transitions should be consolidated to allow internal locking. This could eventually allow users to process validation tasks and query for data in parallel with less locking contention. It also could allow parallel processing and better prioritization of network messages.\n\nSome draft work towards this goal has been started\n* Splitting the net processing mutex: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/net_processing_lock_split\n* Better handling of the last blockfile mutex: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/last_blockfile_mutex\n* Separate cuckoocache locks: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/lock_cuckoocache\n* Making CChain a copy-on-write data structure: https://github.com/alexanderwiederin/bitcoinkernel-proposals/blob/master/cchain-concurrency.md\n\n### Chainstate / ChainstateManager split\n\nThe Chainstate and ChainstateManager are currently tightly coupled, but need not be. In practice this means working with a single chainstate is often needlessly complicated. A draft split of the two classes has been attempted in https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/chainmansplit.\n\n### Compile targets for embedded, web assembly, and proof systems\n\nOne step further than context-free validation would be a kernel API that can compile to architectures with reduced capabilities, e.g. no support for threading, file systems, or atomics. Adding these capabilities could allow the library to be used in embedded environments, e.g. as part of a validating lightning signer or SPV wallet. Targetting riscv bare metal, or llvm IR, could allow re-use in ZK proof systems as well as formal specification languages.\n\nEventually the goal here should be to provide a fully \"sans IO\" version of the API.\n\nA PR adding a riscv bare metal CI job as opened in #31425.\n\n### Evicting the mempool / plug-able policy\n\nThe mempool and its policy rules are currently inside the kernel library, but won't be exposed in the initial API version. Ideally the library should not force its users to re-use the existing Bitcoin Core opinionated implementation, but allow them to either define their own mempool or at least define their own policy rules. A rough proof of concept for removing the mempool from the library is implemented in https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/mempoolout.\n\nThe mempool is currently also the only dependent on boost within the library. Having boost as a dependency makes it a bit harder to build, and makes using the C++ headers in the library directly more annoying.\n\n### Test vectors for the API\n\nThe project should provide test vectors to ensure language bindings around the header APIs are implemented consistently. \n\n### Evicting AssumeUTXO  / AssumeValid\n\nAssumeUTXO/Assumevalid are Bitcoin Core specific approaches to improving IBD speed. It is likely external users of Kernel will not want to be tightly coupled to Bitcoin Core specific processes, e.g., choosing the AssumeUTXO snapshots and assumevalid points. Philosophically, kernel should be as agnostic as possible and not tied to a particular implementation's decisions.\n\n### Isolated kernel repository\n\nEventually Bitcoin Core could itself depend on a standalone kernel repository. Bitcoin Core would likely end up pulling in this project as a subtree. Some open questions around this subject are:\n\n* How would the CI for this repository be set up?\n* How would its own fuzzing and unit test setup look like?\n* What does the release process look like?\n* What is the governance of the project? E.g., is it under Bitcoin Core?\n\nIn many ways, this could be similar to how the libsecp256k1 is maintained in its own repository. Some steps towards this goal have been taken:\n* Adding a dedicated internal kernel library that could be re-used directly by the project: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28690\n* Removing the clientversion dependency from the kernel: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32543\n* Pruning unwanted headers from the library: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/34079\n* Remove translation.h usage from the kernel library: https://github.com/sedited/bitcoin/tree/kernel_rm_translation\n* Having a separate kernel repo: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin-kernel\n\n---\n\n## Action Items\n\n1. If you have any questions, please post them below!\n2. If you have any ideas for the future directions of the project, or want to work on one of the open areas, I'd love to talk about them and support you!\n\n## Project-wide TODOs\n\nThese are suggestions for further cleanup and improvements that came up during review:\n\n* [ ] Various followups for [refactor, kernel: Decouple ArgsManager from blockstorage #27125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125)\n  * [ ] Martin's request for a follow-up fixing the docstring: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125#discussion_r1190350876\n  \n#### Other various items that arose during review and should be tracked\n* Cory's request for cleaning up the kernel interface functions of pointer and reference types: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1202937682\n* Marco's request for getting rid of exceptions in the `ArgsManager`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27491#discussion_r1189586654\n* Russell's request for eliminating the BlockNotify signal: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636#discussion_r1193904693",

Abstracting data storage and validation dependencies is a meaningful step toward broader adoption.\nStandalone repository plans — The goal of making the kernel independently usable and testable is compelling. \nI’d be interested in contributing to the CI setup or test framework design if needed.",
