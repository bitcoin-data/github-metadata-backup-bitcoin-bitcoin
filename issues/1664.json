      "body": "This also appears to happen when it simply has no nodes to connect to, even without -noconnect.  In my case I have a testnet node that has no addresses to connect to, so it keeps cycling through them and the \"bitcoin-opencon\" thread takes a lot of CPU time.\n\nIn my case, it keeps selecting the same peer every half a second (with a nonstandard port #, so after 50 tries), trying to connect to it:\n\n```\ntrying connection XX.XX.XX.XX:18334 lastseen=1542.8hrs\nconnect() failed after select(): Connection refused\n```\n\nNot yet sure why that takes so much CPU usage %, though, as the thread sleeps mostly.\n\nEdit: According to callgrind, most time is spent inside CAddrMan::Select(int), calling CAddrMan::Select_(int), calling GetRandInt(int). \n\nIs that random function so expensive? I think so, after changing to simply use rand(), putting at the top of addrman.cpp a hack\n\n```\n#define GetRandInt(x) (rand()%(x))\n```\n\nThe CPU usage dropped back to 4% only. Still significant, but not close to holding up a core. Using rand might be good enough here, as there is no need for cryptographically secure number here. See also issue #1057.\n\nAnyway, using something like exponential backoff in the connection thread is probably the real fix. Just wanted to know why peer selection was so expensive.\n",
