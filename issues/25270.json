    "title": "Allow groups of accounts to access the RPC cookie file",
    "body": "**Context**\r\nI have multiple accounts on the same box that need to run clients of bitcoind. In particular it's LND and electrs. Bitcoind itself runs in a separate account. I have other accounts that I don't want to have access to bitcoin: e.g. Grafana (graphs/charts web UI). So, the cookie file can be shared amount the relevant accounts via a group. On the file system a group read permissions can be set on each file.  I call the group \"bitcoinclients\". I setup a directory where new files will inherit the bitcoinclients group and will be created with the u=rw,g=r,o= permission. This means bticoin account can write the file, bitcoinclinets group can read it, and no one else has access.\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe problem is that when `bitcoind` is restarted it drops the group read permission on the cookie file so clients in other unix accounts can't read the file.\r\n \r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThere should be a config that allows controlling permissions of the cookie file. Just a boolean that sets the read permissions on the group would be sufficient.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI setup a [chronos workaround](https://github.com/alevchuk/minibank/blob/first/bitcoin/README.md#bitcoin-cookie) but I bet more people will have to re-invent this wheel as the cookie file gets wider adoption.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n[Cookie file](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/25ad2c623af30056ffb36dcd203a52edda2b170f/src/httprpc.cpp#L252) has [more security](https://github.com/Kixunil/security_writings/blob/master/cookie_files.md) over user+password auth. User+password auth is being deprecated in favor of the cookie file.",

      "body": "Agree it would be useful to set permissions on the cookie file, and this would be a simple feature to implement. But I don't think it would be right to say rpcauth is less secure than cookie auth.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage cookies have over RPC passwords is just their convenience. Other than being generated randomly each restart, they don't provide extra security. You could write a script to randomly generate new passwords for grafana each time bitcoin is restarted to get the same effect as using a cookie.\r\n\r\nRPC passwords also have an advantage over cookies because they are hashed. So if an attacker manages to get read access to the bitcoin directory, they can't easily use password hashes to connect to the server, while they could straightforwardly use the cookie file to connect.\r\n\r\nAlso it looks like depending on your setup you may be able control permissions of the cookie file in current versions of bitcoind by running `umask 0027` and passing `-sysperms` argument.",
