Since that wraps both bitcoind and bitcoin-qt, it looks like a similar problem would also happen with `bitcoind` and the `-conf` option. For example if user tried to use the flatpak with `-conf` argument and a configuration file containing `datadir=/some/path`, the configured datadir would be ignored because of the flatpak command line argument.\r\n\r\nMaybe a decent way to fix these issues across all the binaries could be to make [`GetDefaultDataDir`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/66e2d21ef203e422eea8f0a3c7029ac59b210668/src/util/system.cpp#L789) check for a `BITCOIN_DATADIR` environment variable, and change the flatpak to set `BITCOIN_DATADIR` instead of passing `-datadir=`\r\n\r\nHaving the wrapper create an initial `Bitcoin-Qt.conf` as suggested previously could also work to fix the GUI problem, but seems more awkward.",
