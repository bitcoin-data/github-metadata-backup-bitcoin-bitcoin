Since that wraps both bitcoind and bitcoin-qt, it looks like a similar problem would also happen with `bitcoind` and the `-conf` option. For example if user tried to use the flatpak with `-conf` argument and a configuration file containing `datadir=/some/path`, the configured datadir would be ignored because of the flatpak command line argument.\r\n\r\nMaybe a decent way to fix these issues across all the binaries could be to make [`GetDefaultDataDir`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/66e2d21ef203e422eea8f0a3c7029ac59b210668/src/util/system.cpp#L789) check for a `BITCOIN_DATADIR` environment variable, and change the flatpak to set `BITCOIN_DATADIR` instead of passing `-datadir=`\r\n\r\nHaving the wrapper create an initial `Bitcoin-Qt.conf` as suggested previously could also work to fix the GUI problem, but seems more awkward.",

          "body": "I've created an initial Flatpak manifest file and a script to create a local Flatpak bundle. The permissions are pretty much bare-bones at this point. Since the manifest doesn't give read/write permissions for the `$HOME` directory, the application fails to start after the initial setup done by the wizard. There are 3 ways to overcome this issue:\r\n\r\n1. Using a wrapper for setting the `datadir` to some predefined and sandboxed directory, just like [how Bitcoin-Core handles this issue](https://github.com/flathub/org.bitcoincore.bitcoin-qt/blob/master/install_wrappers.sh). This solution is pretty seamless and secure. However, it [restricts the user from choosing another directory](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24612), and feels like a dirty hack.\r\n2. Letting the application access the `$HOME` directory. This approach requires the least effort. However, it violates the sandboxing Flatpak provides, and might cause conflicts if there's also a native version of Gridcoin installed besides the Flatpak version.\r\n3. Using [the XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) for the default location of `datadir`, instead of using the `~/.GridcoinResearch` directory. Following the XDG specifications is considered the best practice on Linux in general, both for Flatpak applications and for other package managers. However, this would require some modification in the codebase.",
