    "title": "Nuke format linter",
    "body": "The linter is impossible to maintain, because it is not possible to parse C++ with a simple regex. When it produces nonsense, like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/runs/27958379841, it is mostly annoying, because the code is perfectly fine, but the red CI is a blocker for the pull request. Also, fixing it isn't trivially possible, so the only solution is to juggle with the code until the regex in the linter is pleased.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to write it as a clang-tidy plugin, however that isn't ideal either, because that will (normally) only run in CI and takes a long time.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it is implemented in `consteval` C++, directly in the source code. (Similar to Rust `std::fmt` or C++20 `std::format`, but they aren't available yet on supported compilers and would be a breaking change in all format strings anyway) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30386#discussion_r1684380835",

(Should there ever be a need to support them, the checks can be trivially side-stepped in that particular line of code by using the unchecked format function: `CheckedFormat(\"%s\", UncheckedFormat(std::string{\"%s\"}, 1))`.\r\n\r\nEdit: I checked the attribute and I couldn't get it to work.

The benefits would be unclear. If tinyformat was replaced with anything, it would probably be `std::format`.",

But yeah, migrating to fmt.dev temporarily to then migrate again to `std::format` is just extra churn anyway.\r\n\r\nWhile looking over #30546 I started to look for fmt.dev's `printf`implementation only to realize it might force me to include some extra copyright notice due to their (variant of?) MIT license. Didn't get to inspecting the actual code though.\r\n\r\n> C++20 `std::format`, but they aren't available yet on supported compilers and would be a breaking change in all format strings anyway\r\n\r\nWas surprised at first because I assumed all of C++20 was available. But comparing https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/20#C.2B.2B20_library_features \"Text formatting\" with /doc/(dependencies|build-windows-msvc).md does indeed show us coming up short. :\\",
