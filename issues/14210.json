    "body": "Our python functional testing framework is pretty limited for what kinds of p2p behaviors we can test.  Basically, we can currently only make manual connections between bitcoind nodes (using the `addnode` rpc), which are treated differently in our code than outbound peers selected using addrman.\r\n\r\nWhile we do have some unit-testing coverage of some of the components (like addrman, and parts of net_processing), I don't believe we currently are able to test the overall logic of how bitcoind uses those components (I recall this coming up when working on #11560, as a specific example).\r\n\r\nAnyway I am just mentioning this here as a potential project idea, as this is a material gap in our testing that I think would be valuable to work towards improving, and I wasn't sure how well known this is.",

      "body": "For background on what we should test, the paper by  @EthanHeilman e.a. explains how the P2P networking works and the kinds of eclipse attack defences that were recently added: \r\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2015/263.pdf\r\n \r\nIn addition to the problem @sdaftuar points to about the difference between manually adding nodes with `addnode` and spontaneous connections, there's two other problems.\r\n\r\n1. The regtest nodes are able to connect to each other via P2P on the same IP but with different ports. That's insufficient for thoroughly testing the behavior because net.cpp checks `IsLocal`, and because the connection buckets are IP based. There's also no DNS seed for regtest.\r\n\r\n2. The networking code relies on real time\r\n\r\nOne approach could be a combination of regtest specific tweaks to the networking code and a few regtest specific RPC calls. The former is always scary, the latter probably fine.\r\n\r\n**Regtest specific networking tweaks** \r\n\r\nThe test framework allows 5000 (`PORT_RANGE`)  distinct port numbers. We could divide those in groups of 1000 to represent `/16 IPv4` IPv4 ranges. Modulo 100 represents the IP address. That leaves 10 nodes max that a regtest node would still consider being local.\r\n\r\nThe cryptographic hash for bucket selection would be hard coded for regtest.\r\n\r\nThe DNS resolver code could have a regtest branch that fetches a fake result from a file (which tests can populate).\r\n\r\nAdd `SetTime()` to set the time which  `GetTime()` can read.\r\n\r\nSwitch the DNS 11 second delay from `sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(11)` to checking `SetAdjusttedTime` every 0.01 seconds until 11 \"seconds\" have passed.\r\n\r\nDitto for `CConnman::ThreadOpenConnections`; instead of the thread sleeping `std::chrono::milliseconds(500)` it could sleep much shorter and check the \"time\".\r\n\r\n**Regtest RPC calls**\r\n\r\n* `settime` calls `SetAdjusttedTime()`\r\n*  methods to get the various peer lists",

      "body": "@dongcarl and I discussed this today, and I wanted to chime in here because there's a good bit of history.\r\n\r\n> Obviously whoever writes the code and does the work gets to decide, but my personal preference would be a way of replacing the network interface with a faked out network interface so that:\r\n> \r\n>     1. A test could spin up a bunch of nodes,\r\n> \r\n>     2. assign them fake IP addresses,\r\n> \r\n>     3. and let them talk to each other without depending on any external systems or touching any network.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> It would allow mostly deterministic tests of all sorts of complex behavior and network failures.\r\n\r\nThis type of testing was almost the entire intention of the CConnman refactor, which got pretty close, and now @dongcarl has picked up lately. It is frustratingly close to being useful.\r\n\r\nThe idea, again, is to be able to run multiple networking instances inside of one bitcoind process.\r\n\r\nIt would be trivial to implement (I have it done in an ancient branch somewhere) the logic to spoof connection data inside of CConnman in order to simulate different test conditions. Phony IPs, fake latency, dropped packets, peer selection algorithm changes, etc. That's how these tests SHOULD work. Spinning up entire instances of bitcoind just to test net behavior is overkill.\r\n\r\nI really think that time and energy would be better spent on finishing up the isolated CConnman instantiation.",

      "body": "From my discussion with @theuni today, if we're going with the route that @EthanHeilman seems to be advocating for, we thought it best to center this work around a minimal, motivating test case that should make the rest very easy. Here's what we came up with:\r\n\r\n1. Instantiate a `CConnman` (let's call it `c1`) with a huge `nSendBufferMaxSize`\r\n2. Instantiate a `CConnman` (let's call it `c2`) with a tiny `nReceiveFloodSize`\r\n3. Start sending messages from `c1` to `c2` and ensure that the buffer size restrictions are honored.\r\n\r\nI believe being able to do this would have caught bugs like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12392. `CConnman` being instantiable like this would allow us to inspect why a `CConnman` instance might have stopped receiving data rather than just guessing based on pings and timing checks.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n> I love to be able to do this in unittests for net.cpp. In those environments the MockNetworkRouter would just be a shared object injected into the components that would be talking to each other. Not saying this is the best way, but just the way I've always thought about it.\r\n\r\nI believe that if we achieve instantiable `CConnman`, a `MockNetworkRouter` would be quite easy.",

This should work with the existing test setup. For instance InterruptibleRecv would be overridden in tests with a MockInterruptibleRecv.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b799ebcc17ea914b6e50f97f008f498ca31e0f36/src/netbase.cpp#L324",

      "body": "I played around with the ideas of @Sjors and @MarcoFalke in order to understand the challenges  for functional tests better and got a POC to work with very few code changes:\r\n* A python mininode sends our node an `addr` message with a couple of local addresses having different ports, and more mininodes are set up to wait for connections on these ports (some tweaks to mininode necessary in order for it to wait for incoming connection and handle the other side of the VERSION logic correctly)\r\n* Regtest-only: In `ProcessMessages` for `addr`, a (so far very crude) mapping from the local ports to external IPs is introduced, so that `addrman` is populated with mocked IPs that are non-local and belong to different /16 IPv4 ranges. Possibly, a more sophisticated mapping as suggested by @Sjors could be benefitial.\r\n* Regtest-only: In `CConnman::ThreadOpenConnections` (after the bucket-specific logic is finished based on the mocked IPs), `OpenNetworkConnection` is called using the original local IP (using `*pszDest` so that `isLocal()` checks are skipped). On the level of `CNode` nothing is mocked so that we don't need to mock networking calls.\r\n\r\nWith this, my test node will connect to up to 8 of the mininodes I set up and treat them as regular outbound peers. It will also attempt feeler connections and after 15759 is merged, blocks-only connections should be initiated, so that all kind of logic based on inbound/outbound behaviour can be tested.\r\n\r\nOf course it is a disadvantage we need to introduce some kind of flag for functional test mock mode and change the logic based on this in at least two places.\r\n\r\nDo you think that is an approach worth following further?",

          "title": "[tests] Allow outbound & block-relay-only connections in functional tests. ",
          "body": "The existing functional test framework uses the `addnode` RPC to spin up manual connections between bitcoind nodes. This limits our ability to add integration tests for our networking code, which often executes different code paths for different connection types. \r\n\r\n**This PR enables creating `outbound` & `block-relay-only` P2P connections in the functional tests.** This allows us to increase our p2p test coverage, since we can now verify expectations around these connection types.\r\n\r\nThis builds out the [prototype](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14210#issuecomment-527421978) proposed by ajtowns in #14210. 🙌🏽\r\n\r\nAn overview of this branch:\r\n- introduces a new test-only RPC function `addconnection` which initiates opening an `outbound` or `block-relay-only` connection. (conceptually similar to `addnode` but for different connection types & restricted to regtest)\r\n- adds `test_framework` support so a mininode can open an `outbound`/`block-relay-only` connection to a `P2PInterface`/`P2PConnection`.\r\n- updates `p2p_blocksonly` tests to create a `block-relay-only` connection & verify expectations around transaction relay. \r\n- introduces `p2p_add_connections` test that checks the behaviors of the newly introduced `add_outbound_p2p_connection` test framework function. \r\n\r\nWith these changes, there are many more behaviors that we can add integration tests for. The blocksonly updates is just one example. \r\n\r\nHuge props to ajtowns for conceiving the approach & providing me feedback as I've built out this branch. Also thank you to jnewbery for lots of thoughtful input along the way. ",
