    "title": "interfaces/wallet: replace raw receive-request string APIs with typed methods",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nAdd typed receive-request APIs to interfaces::Wallet so GUI code passes normal fields (address, label, message, amount, date) instead of serialized blobs.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nThe current interface uses raw strings for receive requests, and GUI code serializes/de-serializes RecentRequestEntry itself. That couples GUI code to wallet storage format and makes format changes risky. Gui actually crashes if it can't de-serialize the string.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd typed wallet methods for receive requests (list/save/delete). UI interfacing with the wallet should have clean types/objects so it knows exactly what to expect.\n\nThe wallet should likely also be responsible for assigning ids, handle legacy entries, and deal with compatibility.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nKeep the current string API and just harden GUI parsing. GUI still owns the storage format, though, and you just have to hope all of the user interfaces interacting with the wallet data are serializing the data in the same way.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
