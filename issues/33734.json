    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nBitcoin Core has a [DNS seed policy](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dnsseed-policy.md).\n\nThere are concerns about @luke-jr's security practices and control over the server: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33723#issuecomment-3457730865\n\n@luke-jr was hacked and posted on his [website](https://luke.dashjr.org/) that his server has been compromised. As of this morning, the warning is still there:\n\n<img width=\"1119\" height=\"308\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dedb2a0a-b6d9-40dc-ac6e-d07f41094a7a\" />\n\nWe also learned of an investigation following the hack and are unsure whether Luke has shared access to the server with investigators. It would be helpful if @luke-jr can clarify this point.\n\nThere are also concerns that @luke-jr is purposefully filtering nodes based on user agent, attempting to stop users from running or connecting to recent versions of Bitcoin Core.\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33723#issuecomment-3458071231\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33723#issuecomment-3458091139\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33723#issuecomment-3457601403\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33723#pullrequestreview-3390131426\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe current behavior appears to violate the [DNS seed policy](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dnsseed-policy.md).\n  \n> 0. A DNS seed operating organization or person is expected to follow good host security practices, maintain control of applicable infrastructure, and not sell or transfer control of the DNS seed. Any hosting services contracted by the operator are equally expected to uphold these expectations.\n>\n> 1. The DNS seed results must consist exclusively of fairly selected and functioning Bitcoin nodes from the public network to the best of the operator's understanding and capability.\n\n\n### Solutions\n\nTypically when a DNS seed is not operating properly, an issue is opened and we wait for the operator to respond (for example, see #29911)\n\nIdeally, the problems are addressed. If not, the DNS seed can be removed (see #33723).\n\nAlternatively, we may determine that there is no violation. Discuss here.\n",

I also don't know if anyone has analyzed whether this heuristic has a protective or beneficial effect, and if the number of such seed nodes changes the magnitude or quality of any of these effects.\n\n",
