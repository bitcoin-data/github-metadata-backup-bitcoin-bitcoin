    "title": "Tracepoint Interface Tracking Issue",
    "body": "With https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26593 merged, a few **ideas** for the Bitcoin Core tracepoint interface that _could_ be next steps. I posted these as a comment in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26593#issuecomment-2468000391 but  surfacing them here for more visibility.\r\n\r\nThese ideas are all up for discussion and aren't TODOs. The numbers don't indicate order or priority but make it easier reference them. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies \r\n1. - [ ] We _could_ internalize the relevant macro parts of systemtap's `sys/sdt.h` for the Linux tracepoints. This would allow us to drop the external dependency on systemtap, as we don't use 99% of it. Some prior commentary on this can be found here: https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/162#issuecomment-2074645621\r\n\r\n## MacOS & FreeBSD support\r\n2.  - [ ]  In the past I've managed to use a simple macro build a bitcoind with tracepoints on macOS. While our ebpf based demo scripts aren't compatible, @kouloumos DTrace scripts from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541 are. This could look similar to https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/blob/13b0ce221600fc7040502c834c51433ca96f91c3/src/util/trace.h#L35-L63. However, I currently don't have access to a macOS system to further work on this - I'm looking to rent one.\r\n3.  - [ ]  The same could possible on FreeBSD with e.g. these macros  https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/blob/13b0ce221600fc7040502c834c51433ca96f91c3/src/util/trace.h#L104-L119.  I haven't tested this on FreeBSD yet. In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27458#pullrequestreview-1387810492, vasild mentiones he'd interested in FreeBSD tracepoints. My understanding is that the same macOS DTrace scripts from 25541 would work there too.\r\n4.  - [ ]  At least for macOS, we'd need an per-tracepoint  interface definition similar to https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/blob/13b0ce221600fc7040502c834c51433ca96f91c3/src/util/trace.h#L121-L236. With some more commentary, these _could_ replace the list of tracepoints in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#tracepoint-documentation. This would solve something similar to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29877#issuecomment-2061028339.\r\n\r\n## Interface stabillity improvements\r\n5.  - [ ] Even if we don't do 4. (because we e.g. don't want to do 2.), casting the tracepoint arguments to the type we expect to pass would be worthwhile to avoid problems like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29877. For some of our traceponts, we already do this: e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/900b17239fb25750fd30b4af6e6c38096374b71f/src/validation.cpp#L2902-L2907\r\n\r\n## Example scripts\r\n6.  - [ ] We *could* drop the example scripts from  `/contrib/tracing/*` and maintain them, along with proper tests in a CI, Bitcoin Core version compatibility information, possibly libbpf-based C or Rust tools (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30298), ... in an external repository like, for example, `0xb10c/tracing-scripts`,  `bitcoin-core/tracing-scripts`, or `bitcoin-monitoring/tracing-scripts` (what ever would works best).\r\n\r\n## Maintain tracepoint interface, drop tracepoint implemenation\r\n7.  - [ ]  If we at some point decide that maintaining the tracepoints in Bitcoin Core adds too much maintenance burden compared to the actual usage they're getting, we could drop the tracepoints but keep the tracepoint interface. We now have a unit test that includes a few nop tracepoints to check that the interface will still compile (https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/blob/0de3e96e333090548a43e5e870c4cb8941d6baf1/src/test/util_trace_tests.cpp). This would allow us to drop the bcc python dependency in the CI and to remove the `interface_usdt_*` functional tests (which need to run in VM and can't run in a container). Tracepoint users could maintain a patch on Bitcoin Core adding the tracepoints (and tests) they want back in. We'd however loose the tracepoints in release (or actually all) builds which currently allow e.g. everyone experiencing problems with their node to hook into them and extract data without needing to restart it.",

      "body": "> We could internalize the relevant macro parts of systemtap's sys/sdt.h for the Linux tracepoints. This would allow us to drop the external dependency on systemtap\r\n\r\nThis still makes sense to me, it's just a few macros which haven't changed in years and are super unlikely to change significantly, because they insert ELF annotations (according to a well-known spec) and NOP instructions.\r\n\r\nDropping a guix dependency would be good!\r\n\r\nBut this is just Linux. i don't know how it is for other platforms, if it's very different then maintaining a \"cross-platform tracepoints header\" inside bitcoin core seems like scope creep.\r\n\r\n> At least for macOS, we'd need an per-tracepoint interface definition similar to https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/blob/13b0ce221600fc7040502c834c51433ca96f91c3/src/util/trace.h#L121-L236. With some more commentary, these could replace the list of tracepoints in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#tracepoint-documentation.\r\n\r\nIf it helps unify things and formalize documentation, that's of course nice!\r\n\r\n> Even if we don't do 4. (because we e.g. don't want to do 2.), casting the tracepoint arguments to the type we expect to pass would be worthwhile to avoid problems like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29877. For some of our traceponts, we already do this\r\n\r\nYes imo it makes sense to add explicit casts. After all the type is essential for the interface to not break, even when the types that are used internally change. Something to be wary for is if a (dumb, forced) cast results in nonsense on the interface.\r\n\r\n> We could drop the example scripts from /contrib/tracing/* and maintain them, along with proper tests in a CI, Bitcoin Core version compatibility information, possibly libbpf-based C or Rust tools (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30298), ... in an external repository like, for example, 0xb10c/tracing-scripts, bitcoin-core/tracing-scripts, or bitcoin-monitoring/tracing-scripts (what ever would works best).\r\n\r\ni think these are two separate points\r\n\r\n- Create a bitcoin core tracing library in (probably) rust, possibly under the `bitcoin-core` github org, to make it easier to hook into them from a \"real\" programming language instead scripting. Although i can also imagine people like Python for this if they want to quickly build one-off experiments (it's still my preferable language for that).\r\n- Remove the python demo scripts from our repository.\r\n\r\n> If we at some point decide that maintaining the tracepoints in Bitcoin Core adds too much maintenance burden compared to the actual usage they're getting\r\n\r\nYeah, one of the aims of the tracepoint interface was that it should be as hands-off as possible (which it is, compared to more intrusive tracing mechanisms that involve internal infrastructure). If it really starts taking significant maintenance time then i think the premise failed. But i don't think that's a likely scenario right now.\r\n\r\nFWIW, i think the kind of performance monitoring that you do is extremely important to health of the network. There's a lot you can see by keeping tabs on specific events and statistics of real nodes, instead of say, just running some benchmarks and measuring full syncs once in a while.\r\n\r\nIf anything, people aren't doing enough of that, and it should be encouraged.\r\n\r\n> Tracepoint users could maintain a patch on Bitcoin Core adding the tracepoints (and tests) they want back in.\r\n\r\ni don't like this. Maintaining patches against a live codebase is horrible, and much more maintenance work than leaving them in.\r\n\r\nAlso having them in the release is good, so if you want to investigate some older node version's behavior you can just download a release, instead of finding how to build it with instrumentation first. Similar to that we now ship the debug symbols with the release downloads.\r\n",
