    "title": "RFC: Do we want to support fuzzing on MacOS?",
    "body": "Fuzzing on MacOS (i.e. actual fuzzing not just running the inputs through the `fuzz` binary) is known to be brittle and we've had plenty of issues reported to us showcasing this:\n\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33667\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32089\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31049\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27550\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19789\n\nThe solution usually involves something along the lines of waiting for a brew llvm update or adding macOS specific hints to our documentation. These issues can however also depend on specific macOS versions, and our hints might not be accurate for every version or get stale with time.\n\nI usually don't chime in on these issues because I don't have a Mac and afaik, all serious fuzzing (at scale & automated) for us (and most other projects) happens on Linux.\n\nI think there are two options:\n\n1. Keep the current approach and fix/document as issues are reported.\n2. Deprecate \"official\" support for fuzzing on macOS and add a section to the docs about using Linux instead (e.g. to use a VM or VPS). MacOS users will still be able to fuzz on a their Mac but it won't be on us to triage the issues for their specific setup.\n\nI'd prefer option 2).",

Keep the current approach and fix/document as issues are reported.\n\nIf we do do this, it should be clear what is supported (i.e just the latest version of LLVM/Clang shipped via brew, using `lld` to link?) , otherwise (as you metion above) we'll be documenting many different \"workarounds\" depending on the version of macOS, version of Apple clang/binutils install, if brew LLVM is being used, and it's version, using `ld64` to link, vs `lld`.\n\n> I'd prefer option 2).\n\nConcept ACK. Getting fuzzing to work on macOS seems like whack-a-mole, and even if somebody can get it to compile, the amount of useful fuzzing they are likely to do, other than a sanity check that the fuzzer doesn't immeadiately crash, seems limited.",

If someone is on an older macOS, they can check the older version of the docs on their own.\n\nObviously this means it will have to be updated yearly, but this is true for a lot of other docs, such as `doc/build-netbsd.md`, which list the latest tested version to work.",
