    "body": "The logging to output that `Config options rpcuser and rpcpassword will soon be deprecated.` was added ~8 years ago in #7044. However these options still continue to get new usage today, i.e https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8354#discussion_r1450166947, and it's easy to forget they are considered deprecated, given they aren't under the normal deprecation mechanism/there aren't more verbose warnings.\r\n\r\nIf we are going to deprecate these options, now seems like a good time to do so. We could start with updating all examples / docs in this repository, to remove any `rpcuser`/`rpcpass` usage.\r\n\r\nIf we aren't actually planning on ever deprecating/removing these options, we should probably update the logging output to remove the mentions of future deprecation.",

      "body": "Surprisingly I found very few instances of `rpcuser` and `rpcpassword` remaining in the docs. I updated their usage, and the example init scripts, in [this branch](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...willcl-ark:bitcoin:deprecate-rpcuser) to see the scope of changes that would be required on the doc side.\r\n\r\nI think if we want to fully deprecate these options, the changes in that branch along with #28167 as mentioned above, should come first.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that it would be best to still try and fully deprecate these, but due to how widely they are used we will have to include some highly visible warnings about the new behaviour... Some thoughts I had on this:\r\n\r\n* We would need to decide if having these keys in `bitcoin.conf` would halt bitcoind/-qt startup\r\n  * If we _don't_ fail startup (just log a warning to debug.log and ignore the options) users would wonder why their RPC calls are \"mysteriously\" failing when their credentials match those in `bitcoin.conf`. Presumably Bitcoin Core would silently be using a .cookie in this case.\r\n  * If we _do_ fail startup then it's possible that many (semi) automated node setups would simply fail to start back up after an upgrade -- without manual intervention to remove these keys from the config -- which seems pretty sub-optimal.\r\n* Asking users who have always been able to just run the binaries + a config file, to now run a python script from `share/`  to generate auth credentials feels a bit, messy?\r\n  * Perhaps `bitcoin-cli` should get a `generaterpcauth` command?\r\n  \r\nAn alternative might be to not deprecate these options at all, but instead we could require specific permissions on the `bitcoin.conf` file itself, like how `ssh` requires specific permissions of `600` for `id_rsa` private key files. I don't like this idea much as it is not providing the same level of security as the `rpcauth` directive, and AFAIU doesn't bring benefit to Windows users in the same way. But it is _quite_ similar in protection mechanism to the cookie file (i.e. read access to the (config) file grants you RPC access). Notably this does not solve the same fail-to-restart-after-upgrade issues mentioned above. The config file permissions option doesn't seem to me to offer enough reward:risk.",
