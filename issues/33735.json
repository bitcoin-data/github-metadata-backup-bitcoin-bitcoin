    "body": "\n _Originally posted by @maflcko in [#33640](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33640#issuecomment-3458556346)_\n\nI presume the same issue exists for the lint task. Though, the caching there does not seem to work at all. So it could make sense to make the caching work there, and then also add a retry loop there.\n \n \nOtherwise, there could be Ubuntu APT timeouts like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/18861389218/job/53820273763?pr=33247#step:4:1053 \n",
