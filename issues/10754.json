    "body": "After #10192, we have two separate caches, which are in memory blocks of equal size. This is likely not the best possible tuning, but sadly its tricky to get right because the sigcache is now used more as a DoS protection/reorg speedup and less as a cache used in normal operation. See-also, @JeremyRubin's suggestion of using the same table and further discussion at, eg, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10192#issuecomment-313334895.",

I'd really like to understand how 8 way fanout is optimal, if it is, since that amount of memory latency should significantly slower than e.g. four way fanout into buckets of two esp with caches much larger than L3. Reports were that it wasn't which suggests to me that something is wrong, either in our implementation or in my understanding of the hardware, maybe our hash function is too slow and thats obscuring it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to look at is tuning the eviction/epoch counter part.",

This is because a recently inserted transaction should be close to it's first hash-index and a recently inserted transaction is more likely to be mined.\r\n\r\nIf you want to simulate the worst case you should write a benchmark that tests the cache with a block that has all previously unseen signatures/transactions.",

To find out more I added a simple benchmark to test lookup performance of an 8 and 2-way fanout (I also tried a 4-way fanout into buckets of 2, but I think my implementation was not optimal, and in any case we can consider results from the 2-way fanout I think). This is the closest scenario to the block connection case where we consult the cache(s) but don't store anything in them (i.e. cause evictions), and this is the case IMO that we should care most about.\n\nThese results were as follows:\n\n- 8-way fanout: 193.5μs per 4,000 lookups (48.4ns per lookup)\n- 2-way fanout: 142.3μs per 4,000 lookups (35.6ns per lookup)\n\nSo 2-way fanout (as expected) is 26% faster for pure lookups. There is certainly a little room for improvement by changing fanout of the cache, but would it be worth it?\n\nIf we consider that a block might have ~4k lookups in the script cache, then it follows that the time spent doing lookups in the cache would be:\n\n- 4,000 lookups × 48.4ns = 194μs total cache time (8-way)\n- 4,000 lookups × 35.6ns = 142μs total cache time (2-way)\n\nThis could mean a saving of ~52μs per block by switching to a naive 2-way fanout. In the 4-way fanout into buckets of 2 case this would likely be a smaller saving still.\n\n(I also wrote a benchmark to cause evictions and saw again speedups with a 2-way fanout, but these feel less instructive to me, particularly in the case of block connection.)\n\nIn terms of cache sizes, currently these both store ~525,000 32-byte elements with 45% of the cache sized used per-epoch, which equates to \\~236,250 elements per epoch. Based on current mempool sizes this seems like more than enough for both caches, which seems to align with my logs seeing \\~100% script cache hits during connection.\n\nI did not yet look at tuning the epoch/eviction counter, nor Jeremy's idea of sharing the same table (or making hashes \"sticker\" by entering them multiple times) as I saw such good hit-rates with the current configuration in block acceptance, but could do so if there was still interest in that...\n\nSo overall, whilst there is some performance improvement possible here, I'm not convinces it's particularly worth making changes for.",
