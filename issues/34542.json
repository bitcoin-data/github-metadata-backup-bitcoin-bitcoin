    "body": "As suggested during the IRC meeting last week ([logs](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2026-02-05.html#l-251)), this issue is for discussing recent progress on [Erlay](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0330.mediawiki), evaluating its trade-offs and goals, and ultimately deciding whether it's worth continuing to pursue.\n\nThe current project tracking issue is https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30249, though some of the performance research results shown there may be outdated. We can gather updated data here and discuss.\n\nCouple questions on my mind:\n\n- What does the bandwidth/latency trade-off look like as we scale the number of connections?\n- Do the benefits outweigh the added code complexity?\n\nOf course, discussion isn't limited to the above. Feel free to bring up any other points that come to mind.",
