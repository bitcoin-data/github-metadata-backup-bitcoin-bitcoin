I am aware backtrace only contains ??? instead of anything useful, that's probably because I don't have debugging symbols for bitcoind, or maybe I would need to have it compiled locally with special flags and so on. This is not the case, so I only have what I shared.\r\nLogs contains nothing else worth mentioning, machine continues to run as intended. Bitcoind is in automatic restart loop, I've implemented this years ago when I was having problems with it. Not any more, this rare crash is first time I've seen in years.\r\nIf you have any suggestions how to enable more debugging in bitcoind, so that any future backtrace can be more useful, please let me know.",

Thanks.\r\n\r\nThe idea was that you don't have to tell gdb before a crash, but that you can (even after the crash) convert the addr-stack to something readable.\r\n\r\nHowever, I couldn't get that to work, so someone else will have to explain how it is supposed to work.\r\n\r\nMy next recommendation would be to re-compile with guix, but skip the split-debug.sh step, and then convert the addrs using the \"full\" binary.",
