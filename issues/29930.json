The assertion that failed is m_worker_threads.empty()\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\n26.1\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nWindows, MinGW64 (using portable_endian.h)\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
