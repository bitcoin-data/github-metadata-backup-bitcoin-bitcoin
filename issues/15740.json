    "title": "Change handling of \"h\" versus \"'\" marker for hardened derivation in descriptors",
    "body": "Per some discussion in #bitcoin-core-dev -- getdescriptorinfo should probably not canonicalize the descriptor given, but return it exactly as provided. This is because it is the easiest way to get a checksum for a descriptor written by hand, and it's profoundly annoying that there's no way to get a checksum for a non-canonical descriptor right now (one containing the \"h\" marker for hardened, or containing a private key.)\r\n\r\nAlso discussed was the possibility of switching the default marker from \"'\" to \"h\". The apostrophe is very annoying to work with over RPC because of quoting problems, which is why \"h\" is accepted. Better to just use \"h\" everywhere for the same reason.",

      "body": "I was working with @myveryown earlier today on debugging a difficulty using descriptors and I found it very unintuitive that this command returns not just an obvious checksum (which is appreciated) but also converts `h` to `'` in origin info in a way that's not immediately obvious:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ bitcoin-cli getdescriptorinfo \"wpkh([f6bb4c63/0h/0h/30h]028429a37c3f09c8c5cc1fab58df32d1a7da7616c748a40eeb1aae1d64acb9c5cc)\" | jq -r .descriptor\r\nwpkh([f6bb4c63/0'/0'/30']028429a37c3f09c8c5cc1fab58df32d1a7da7616c748a40eeb1aae1d64acb9c5cc)#5wdxpxcx\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until @gwillen pointed out this substitution of `h` with `'` that I realized what was going wrong with my attempts to troubleshoot @myveryown's problem.  I'm in agreement with the OP on both points:\r\n\r\n1. getdescriptorinfo should provide a way to get the checksum for a non-canonical descriptor\r\n2. Paths using hardened derivation should preferentially be indicated by an `h` rather than a `'`\r\n\r\nI think the output should probably look something like this:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ bitcoin-cli getdescriptorinfo \"wpkh([f6bb4c63/0h/0h/30h]028429a37c3f09c8c5cc1fab58df32d1a7da7616c748a40eeb1aae1d64acb9c5cc)\"\r\n{\r\n  \"descriptor\": \"wpkh([f6bb4c63/0h/0h/30h]028429a37c3f09c8c5cc1fab58df32d1a7da7616c748a40eeb1aae1d64acb9c5cc)#vk9vfu0h\"\r\n  \"normalized\": \"wpkh([f6bb4c63/0'/0'/30']028429a37c3f09c8c5cc1fab58df32d1a7da7616c748a40eeb1aae1d64acb9c5cc)#5wdxpxcx\",\r\n  \"isrange\": false,\r\n  \"issolvable\": true,\r\n  \"hasprivatekeys\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Instead of \"canonical\", I use \"normalized\" because it has the same number of letters as \"descriptor\" and so aligns well in fixed-width displays.  Also canonical seems more ambiguous than normalized in this context.)",

In addition to RPC usage, it's probably also less susceptible to graphical operating systems messing with quote marks.\r\n\r\nI'm on the fence regarding private keys. At least our RPC should not echo private keys, so it would have to return the checksum without the rest of the descriptor.

The only reason `'` was being used was because that was the the derivation path that the wallet stored for each key. However since derivation paths are now stored as integer values, it should be fine and safe to change everywhere it is displayed to use `h`. Note that we still may need to have the wallet continue to write out `'` in the derivation path string in `CKeyMetaData` for backwards compatibility reasons, but that string shouldn't be displayed anymore so it doesn't really matter.",

This transforms the descriptor into one with public derivation everywhere, which is scary.\r\n\r\nSo I guess this should be a vote in favor of reviving the idea to just force everything to be 'h' instead of ' by default.",

      "body": "@sipa certainly `[]()/*'` all have special meaning in bash, but only one of them can't be made literal by encapsulating it in single quotes and can't even be escaped by simply prefixing it with a backslash within single quotes.\r\n\r\nThe challenge I often have is that I need to use one set of quotes to escape a string from the shell and a different set of quotes to indicate a string to the JSON parser; this is most easily done using double quotes for one string and single quotes for the other string, e.g. I want to do something like this:\r\n\r\n    bitcoin-cli scantxoutset start '[{\"desc\": \"pkh([d34db33f/44'/0'/0']xpub6ERApfZwUNrhLCkDtcHTcxd75RbzS1ed54G1LkBUHQVHQKqhMkhgbmJbZRkrgZw4koxb5JaHWkY4ALHY2grBGRjaDMzQLcgJvLJuZZvRcEL/1/*)\"}]'\r\n\r\nBut instead I have to add three escape characters per single quote in the BIP32 path:\r\n\r\n    bitcoin-cli scantxoutset start '[{\"desc\": \"pkh([d34db33f/44'\\''/0'\\''/0'\\'']xpub6ERApfZwUNrhLCkDtcHTcxd75RbzS1ed54G1LkBUHQVHQKqhMkhgbmJbZRkrgZw4koxb5JaHWkY4ALHY2grBGRjaDMzQLcgJvLJuZZvRcEL/1/*)\"}]'\r\n\r\nThe extra effort is annoying, but I think it's also a challenging problem for users who are less experienced at the shell.  If you run the first command above, the error you get is:\r\n\r\n    bash: syntax error near unexpected token `)'\r\n\r\nThat's not very useful to an inexperienced user---they may think they need to escape the parens at the end of the string rather than noticing the problem with the single quotes near the beginning of the string.  And, as @gwillen noted, it's easy for a user to get the escaping wrong and not notice the shell submitted a different descriptor than they expected, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    $ set -x\r\n    $ bitcoin-cli scantxoutset start '[{\"desc\": \"pkh([d34db33f/44'/0'/0]xpub6ERApfZwUNrhLCkDtcHTcxd75RbzS1ed54G1LkBUHQVHQKqhMkhgbmJbZRkrgZw4koxb5JaHWkY4ALHY2grBGRjaDMzQLcgJvLJuZZvRcEL/1/*)\"}]'\r\n    + bitcoin-cli scantxoutset start '[{\"desc\": \"pkh([d34db33f/44/0/0]xpub6ERApfZwUNrhLCkDtcHTcxd75RbzS1ed54G1LkBUHQVHQKqhMkhgbmJbZRkrgZw4koxb5JaHWkY4ALHY2grBGRjaDMzQLcgJvLJuZZvRcEL/1/*)\"}]'\r\n\r\nI think users are a lot less likely to encounter problems with the other special characters, since those characters will probably be escaped normally and so interpreted literally.",

      "body": "I took a quick look at what it would take to change the default from `'` to `h`. (Considering in particular whether it makes more sense to try to change it only at the interface, or also internally.) Here's what I found:\r\n\r\n* 10 functional tests (plus `psbt_wallet_tests.cpp`) have `'` hardcoded in various places that I could find. (Generally found by grepping for roughly `44'|49'|84'|/0'|/1'`). The functional tests would need to be changed no matter what, insofar as they are parsing RPC output and looking for `'` and not `h`.\r\n* In `descriptor.cpp`:\r\n  * `BIP32PubkeyProvider::ToString` and `::ToPrivateString` emit `'`.\r\n  * `ParseKeyPath` accepts either `'` or `h`, so that's no problem. \r\n* In `bip32.cpp`:\r\n  * `FormatHDKeypath` emits `'`.\r\n  * `ParseHDKeypath` does a string search for `'`. I think this would be safe to change to `h` because it only operates on path components, which otherwise are purely numeric (and it checks this.)\r\n* In `scriptpubkeyman.cpp`:\r\n  * `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::DeriveNewChildKey` and `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::SetupDescriptorGeneration` both have a bunch of hardcoded keypath fragments with apostrophes in them.\r\n* In `descriptor_tests.cpp`:\r\n  * There is a function `UseHInsteadOfApostrophe` which is used to turn descriptors with `'` into descriptors with `h` to ensure that both formats are tested. Since that direction is easily done with a character substitution, but the reverse is not, it would seem necessary to keep these testcases formatted with an apostrophe to easily test parsing of both styles.\r\n\r\nI get the impression that internally, descriptors are stored at least sometimes as strings with `'`, and `ParseHDKeyPath` is used for parsing these (and only accepts `'`, never `h`). However, it seems that (outside of tests), this is only used:\r\n* When the key origin (with pre-parsed path) is missing (`walletdb.cpp:463`); or\r\n* When upgrading a wallet without the flag `WALLET_FLAG_KEY_ORIGIN_METADATA` (`scriptpubkeyman.cpp:392`).\r\n\r\nSo I assume a newly-created wallet will store a non-string key origin, and this codepath will not be used. All other parsing of keypaths appears(?) to go through `descriptor.cpp`'s `ParseKeyPath` function, which accepts both.\r\n\r\nSo with all that out of the way:\r\n\r\n* Which of these functions are used for stuff we get from / write to the walletdb, and which for RPCs and other UI uses? Is it strictly split between `bip32.cpp` for the former, and everything else is the latter?\r\n* Is it okay to just let `ParseHDKeyPath` accept both formats, or is this undesirable?\r\n* Is it okay for descriptors stored in the wallet to switch from `'` to `h` going forward? Does this break compatibility in a way that requires some kind of flag or version bump? (I'm not super familiar with wallet versioning stuff, but keep in mind that the wallet -- at least the CURRENT wallet -- does not APPEAR to ever parse this unless the key origin metadata is missing. If it is the case that NO version of Core (which is willing to read a modern wallet file) will do so, then this may be compatible.)\r\n* Have I gone too far, and should I just be looking at doing this for descriptors that are presented to the user (e.g. via RPC)? This is tricky because `'` and `h` give different checksums, so this change has to happen before the checksum is added. (Are descriptors in the wallet stored with checksums, or without?)",

With this change `listdescriptors` will use `h`, so you can copy-paste the result, without having to add escape characters or switch `'` to 'h' manually.\r\n\r\nBoth markers can still be parsed.\r\n\r\nThe `hdkeypath` field in `getaddressinfo` is also impacted by this change, except for legacy wallets. The latter is to prevent accidentally breaking ancient software that uses our legacy wallet. \r\n\r\nSee discussion in #15740",
