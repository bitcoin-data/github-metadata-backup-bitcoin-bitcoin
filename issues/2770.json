    "body": "I've run bitcoin-qt Mac client on the latest OSX version since 0.3.x thru to 0.7.2 with literally zero problems ever, on essentially this same hardware setup.\n\nSince the 0.8 update and switch to LevelDB none of the three Mac client releases have worked stably for me and I've had to downgrade to 0.7.2 (with the May 15 workaround) to maintain a stable bitcoin wallet.\n\nCurrent setup is: MacBook Pro Retina, OSX 10.8.4, bitcoin-qt 0.8.2\n\nI saw that some of the known corruption issues/bugs were fixed/closed with the 0.8.2 release, so I decided to try the upgrade again.  After re-indexing and working fine for hours at time (much better than 0.8.1 at least) upon restart I get \"Error opening block database. Do you want to rebuild the block database?\" which of course I don't want to do because it takes forever, even on this world's fastest Mac with SSD drive.  This has happened 6 times now, and the interesting line in debug.log is:\n\nVerifying last 288 blocks at level 3\nLevelDB read failure: Corruption: block checksum mismatch\n\nMore details here:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155140.0\n\nDowngrading to 0.7.2 again, please help permanently fix this in the next 0.8.x release.\n",

I wrote a little python tool to dump the log records (http://skypaint.com/bitcoin/dumplogfile.py ), and something odd happened at bytes 65,506-65.536: there are 30 zero bytes.\n\nSo the records look like (output from my dumplogfile.py ):\n\n  FULL length 1012 (position: 64490)\n  0 length 0 (position: 65509)\n  0 length 0 (position: 65516)\n  0 length 0 (position: 65523)\nBLOCK 2\n  LAST length 1121 (position: 65536)\n\n... and leveldb is very upset that there is no FIRST record before the LAST record at the beginning of block 2 (block as in \"leveldb 32,768-byte block of records\", not bitcoin block).\n\nWHY those 30 zero bytes were written.... I dunno.\n",

From what I've seen, none of the v0.8.x Mac releases with LevelDB work reliably.\n\nI've made some noise after each of the v0.8.x Mac releases that they are not working reliably, but this is the first time I've seen any of the devs semi-publically acknowledge it.\n\nI'm sure there are plenty of Mac users downloading and running these buggy releases every day, with no idea there may be a problem, and the number of posts to the bitcointalk Tech Support forum about this confirm it.\n\nI am well-informed and technical enough to know to use v0.7.2 and install the \"May 15 workaround\", but I'm sure there are PLENTY of other Mac users who are not.\n\nA public announcement that the existing v0.8.x Mac releases are bad and an official release of a v0.7.3 Mac backport I think is probably the right next step.\n",

Let's recap the facts here:\n\n1.) running 0.7.2 client since release (and all previous Mac client releases) on this same machine has NEVER crashed or corrupted on me.\n\n2.) ALL 0.8.x client releases have corrupted for me (eventually or quickly)\n\n3.) NO other software or files have ever turned up corrupted for me on this machine\n\n4.) It has a relatively new SSD drive,\n\n5.) which is running with FileVault2 full-disk encryption ... so shouldn't any hardware errors (do SSD drives get errors?) be transparent to the operating system?\n\nIs there anything you could suggest I do that might help diagnose this further?\n\nCan you tell from that debug.log exactly which file it's saying it can't read?\n\nI took a Time Machine backup between the first successful run of 0.8.5 and the second when it failed to open.  In theory, if we can determine which file bitcoin-qt is saying is bad, could a restore from backup of a \"good?\" copy of that file tell us whether the \"bad?\" copy was really due to hardware corruption on the disk?\n",

Which means that the file was truncated somehow or the writes happened out of order and the block append just didn't happen but the database update did.\n",

      "body": "@wtogami Thank you for your efforts, I'm so glad to see this issue receive the attention it deserves.\n\nThis weekend I got a chance to try your latest binary.  I downloaded and installed your Bitcoin-Qt-0.8.5-OMG3.dmg on my MacbookPro Retina, now running OSX Mavericks v10.9.\n\nOnce again I reindexed my up-to-date v0.7.2 blockchain, this time it took about 4 hours.  It finished reindexing with no problem, got synced with the network, and ran fine with no issue for several minutes until I did a clean shutdown.\n\nAnother positive I see is finally a return of Retina fonts to bitcoin-qt!  As far as I know, v0.7.2 is the only bitcoin-qt release that had \"Retina-style\" HiDPI font support.  All previous releases, and then again all the v0.8.x releases, look all jaggy on the Retina screen.  Of course I'm probably part of a very small audience here, and the other non-font GUI elements are of course still low-res, but it definitely look a lot sharper for me like this, so thanks!\n\nUnfortunately the bad news is that upon first restart I got the exact same issue as last time, my dreaded: \"Corrupted block database detected. Do you want to rebuilt the block database now?\" \n\nHere's the relevant part of debug.log for you:\n\nOpened LevelDB successfully\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): last block file = 6\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): last block file info: CBlockFileInfo(blocks=37, size=3188636, heights=267817...267853, time=2013-11-04...2013-11-04)\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): transaction index disabled\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): hashBestChain=000000000000000450718beafbece467989022fe2265c5dd69b07f0ca5b40e8f  height=267853 date=2013-11-04 07:21:53\ninit message: Verifying blocks...\nVerifying last 288 blocks at level 3\nERROR: bool CBlock::ReadFromDisk(const CDiskBlockPos&)() : deserialize or I/O error\nERROR: VerifyDB() : **\\* block.ReadFromDisk failed at 267816, hash=0000000000000006fd15a014c76b0bd0200b74cbcbe8f3a873cedd2798e65a59\nShutdown : In progress...\n\nSince this failed in exactly the same way as last time, and differently than how it used to die, it got me thinking a little deeper about the situation, so allow me to speculate on what I think may be going on here.\n\nLet me preface this by saying I am NOT A PROGRAMMER and have never even tried to read the bitcoin source code, so this is nothing more than an educated guess as to how things may actually be working internally.\n\nI noticed that pre-0.8.x bitcoin-qt stores the blockchain in files that fill up to 2.1 GB before spilling over to a new one.  Before this update/reindex I had blk0001.dat - blk0005.dat each 2.1 GB and then blk0006.dat 1.7 GB and I was synced to up to (I think about) 267816.\n\nWhen I start the update and it does the reindex, it seems like it hardlinks the old block files with a slightly different name, but now in the /blocks/ directory.\n\nNow, with the reindex complete, as the new client runs, rather than appending new blocks to the last 1.7 GB blockfile, it creates a new one, rather than continuing to fill up the last old one to 2.1 GB.  So now with any new blocks that came in during the 4 hours I was reindexing, or the 20-30 minutes I let it run afterwards, look like they've gone into a new 16.8 MB /blocks/blk00006.dat, and leaving a 1.7 GB blk00005.dat.\n\nSo then when I do the first cold restart, guessing from the behavior and the debug.log messages, it seems like it gets up to the last block 267816 I had previously synced and tries to keep reading from that last < 2.1 GB block file rather than looking for the new small one, and therefore quits with error \"blockchain corrupted\".\n\nAgain, maybe a shot in the dark here, but I think some version of this theory makes sense in light of some of the other  clues.  It could be that the \"general Mac corruption issue\" has been solved, but perhaps some new bug was introduced that only affects people (like me) updating from older Mac client blockchains.  Recall, these recent releases are \"corrupting\" for me immediately upon first restart in exactly the same way, and in a completely different way than how it used to get corrupted at some random, inconsistent moment with the earlier v0.8.x releases.\n\nWhat do you think?\n",

Even then when I ticked it off it isn't clear if the executable is run directly from the command line if the OS respects that tick.  I was running:\n\n/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt.app/Contents/MacOS/Bitcoin-Qt -dbcache=1000\n\nfrom the command line on advice the initial sync would go faster.\n\nSo whether it was the App Nap, or this other issue mentioned https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3243 which I also experienced, or just general slowness, this full sync took a LONG time for me.\n\nBut it did eventually finish last night, successfully, and ran well for hours thereafter and after a few restarts, so I was all ready to type up congratulatory comments that perhaps our Mac corruption bugs had finally been licked.\n\nBut then when I restarted Bitcoin-Qt again this morning, I got the dreaded error again:\n\nBitcoin version v0.8.5-OMG3-beta (2013-10-30 17:50:47 -1000)\nUsing OpenSSL version OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013\nStartup time: 2013-11-13 16:31:51\nDefault data directory /Users/----/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin\nUsing data directory /Users/-----/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin\nUsing at most 125 connections (2560 file descriptors available)\nUsing 8 threads for script verification\ninit message: Verifying wallet...\ndbenv.open LogDir=/Users/-----/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/database ErrorFile=/Users/-----/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/db.log\nBound to [::]:8333\nBound to 0.0.0.0:8333\ninit message: Loading block index...\nOpening LevelDB in /Users/-----/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/blocks/index\nOpened LevelDB successfully\nOpening LevelDB in /Users/-----/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/chainstate\nOpened LevelDB successfully\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): last block file = 92\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): last block file info: CBlockFileInfo(blocks=453, size=65057378, heights=268923...269375, time=2013-11-11...2013-11-13)\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): transaction index disabled\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): hashBestChain=00000000000000062c7d79d3d301f71320f986585ae385d5c356e444fed23f7f  height=269375 date=2013-11-13 08:17:03\ninit message: Verifying blocks...\nVerifying last 288 blocks at level 3\nLevelDB read failure: Corruption: block checksum mismatch\nShutdown : In progress...\nStopNode()\nFlushed 0 addresses to peers.dat  15ms\nCommitting 10456 changed transactions to coin database...\nShutdown : done\n\nSo again, this is @wtogami 's v0.8.5-OMG3-beta binary, about 12 hours after a complete full sync from the network.\n\nOn a related note, your v0.8.5.2-rc4-beta Litecoin binary is still running great with no problems.\n",

Although, your results don't give me much hope of this working now.\n\n@toffoo Any chance you're hopping between networks/locations, such as home vs. work? I mentioned this on IRC the other day - I'm starting to suspect changing networks somehow causes this dreaded corruption error. Don't ask me to explain why that would be the case, but that's what I've been noticing. I can fire up the client without issue in one location, go to the other location, and get the corruption error. Take it back to the previous location, database validates just fine. And it isn't always the same result for each location. If I \"fix\" it in one location that was broken before (either by answering Yes to the rebuild question or seeding my Bitcoin folder with validated files), it very well may work there but now break in the other location. I can't imagine the client IP address or other network configuration would play into validating the block database, but... :suspect: \n",

I've resisted saying anything for quite a while but it's just been too common lately to not at least mention it. Let us know if there is any specific testing you'd like done using OMG3+.\n",

Background: I'm researching \"filesystems-applications-interfacing\" bugs, and I've delved into some detail on LevelDB bugs.\n\nThere's a lot of confusing information here, and I'm having trouble reproducing the bug, so it'll be really helpful if someone can provide me with the following information: \n1. Did the bug happen with process crashes, or clean shutdowns, or system suspends, or system crashes? I hear many people saying clean shutdowns, just making sure. Did a system crash happen at some recent point in the past for people who got corruption with just clean shutdowns?\n2. A snapshot of the \"blocks/index/\" directory and the \"chainstate/\" directory in which the LevelDB corruptions were reported. I see gavinandresen's MANIFEST, but a full snapshot would be appreciated.\n\nThanks for the trouble!\n",

      "body": "Thank you @wtogami and @rescrv.  I have installed the new -OMG5 binary and so far so good.  I re-indexed from my up-to-date v0.7.2 blockchain (with -dbcache=1000) and it took about 2.5 hours.  Left it running for a while to get synced, all smooth.  Opened closed half dozen times, reboots, suspends, etc. all good.\n\nI think the jury is still out on whether this devious bug is actually gone for good, but things are looking good.  Scrolling up, I recall that the longest any of the v0.8.x releases have lasted for me without corrupting is about 2-3 days.  So I'll continue playing around with this in the coming days and will report back with any anomalies.\n\nOther Mac users who have suffered corruption issues please post your experiences with this new binary as well..\n",

During this time I was open/close/suspend/reboot frequently and nothing could phase it.\n\nBut then upon first boot up several hours later I got the crash.\n\nAs discussed on IRC, I'm currently bittorrenting the fresh bootstrap.dat and will index directly with -OMG6 next to see if I can recreate the issue and discount other hypotheses.\n",

Indexing above block height 250,000 still seemed to take a very long time, with all sorts of errors in debug.log, but did eventually complete and run successfully.\n\nAll tests with -OMG6b have so far worked fine (with regards to the levelDB corruption issue) but a different issue was encountered: directly after sending a transaction (and using Coin Control for my first time) bitcoin-qt crashed with an OSX traceback and here it is:\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/g8QqheGc\n\nThis same issue was also reported by LitecoinDev coblee.\n\nI was able to restart bitcoin-qt with no DB corruption reported and the tx that caused the crash did go thru.\n\nApart from this probably unrelated issue, -OMG6b (from the bootstrap.dat reindex) continues to work fine and has not produced or reported corruption.\n\n@rescrv has requested a core dump from a DB corruption crash (if possible).\n\nWe determined that OSX does not default to save core dumps, but it can be turned on (before the crash happens of course) with the command: ulimit -c unlimited\n\nThe Bitcoin-Qt binary must then be run from the same Terminal using the command: /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt.app/Contents/MacOS/Bitcoin-Qt\n\nThis setting is not robust to reboots or new Terminal windows and must therefore always be run beforehand each time.\n\nI successfully generated a core dump by reproducing the 'send tx' bug.  And we also determined that it would probably be a security risk to share a core dump from bitcoin-qt running a \"live wallet\".\n\nCurrently under discussion whether I continue testing with -OMG6b, revert to -OMG5, or await a new binary?\n",

Since applying the msync patch I provided, the corruption issue originally reported has not been confirmed by anyone else, including toffoo (the original reporter).  What's been reported since has been a series of hard crashes, mostly within Qt code, that do not follow the pattern of corruption originally reported in any of the linked forum posts.\n\nThese bugs reside outside LevelDB, and are not part of the (now infamous) LevelDB corruption bug.\n",

      "body": "Toffoo's crashes at startup are most likely because the state is invalid, yes.  But that does not imply that it is LevelDB corruption.  Every time he has had corruption, it has been preceded by a crash in code that is _not_ LevelDB.\n\nIn the first chainstate he posted since the crash, there was absolutely zero LevelDB corruption.  Every file is parseable in its entirety.  Every entry is retrievable using any access pattern (iteration or \"get\").  Every checksum matches the blocks it should.  If the state is corrupt, it was corrupted before being put into LevelDB, or (and this is unlikely), the corruption affected the data and the checksums just right so that everything is consistent.  The problem he reports here is at a higher level, and was preceded by the crash in Qt.\n\nIn the second chainstate he posted (mactest1), there is indeed corruption in `010255.sst`.  There's a handful of keys in this file that are corrupted, but no other files.  The key observation here is that this file was generated as a result of compaction, and the corruption is localized to a small run of keys.  Because the file was generated by compaction, the input keys were verified and likely came from several different SST files, implying that the corruption occurred during compaction and was not present before the compaction started.  The corruption itself indicates that something changed the contents of either the checksum or the written data strictly after a valid checksum was computed.  Given the brief, direct nature of that code, and the fact that it's run millions of times per day in all the different apps that use LevelDB, it's a pretty sure bet that the corruption is generated by something else in the same process.  To follow this train of thought further, LevelDB is heavily used within the Chrome web browser (for which it was designed), the HyperDex NoSQL store, and as a core component of the MVP of many startups.  These users are not reporting corruption during compaction, and no reports of such corruption exist outside bitcoin-qt.\n\nThe underlying cause of the GUI crashes is likely also responsible for whatever bug within Bitcoin-Qt is now corrupting toffoo's state.  But that bug is not the LevelDB bug that was first reported where the data was corrupted on a _clean shutdown_.  The recent reports have been linked to the GUI, and the nature of the crash would also directly explain the subsequent corruption as well.  According to @wtogami on IRC, the GUI code was [\"a simple race condition in the GUI code, probably a double free\"](http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2013/12/01#l1385934527), which is exactly the kind of bug that would lead to errant corruption that indiscriminately affects data both inside and outside of LevelDB.\n",

One bit flip can be enough. Crypto is fragile like that. In a way the early warning is good - stop using the machine for bitcoin until you are sure it is fixed, corruption in wallet operations could result in coin loss.\n",
