    "body": "The new anchors.dat file stores a vector of `CAddress` objects, and doesn't set ADDRV2_FORMAT. That means that torv3 and other addrv2 network types won't be serialized correctly in it. It would be good to address this in 0.21.\r\n\r\nNow, CAddress does have a version field, which can be used to signal the encoding. In the current code, on serialization that value stores whether ADDRV2_FORMAT is set or not, and on deserialization that value is inspected to determine which deserializer to use. #20509 was just opened to change this, and that may complicate matters.\r\n\r\nThat means there are a number of possible solutions here:\r\n* Make CAddress deserialization use the context version rather than the disk version (20509) and make anchors.dat always use ADDRV2_FORMAT. This means potential problems too if there is ever an addrv3.\r\n* Make anchors.dat always set ADDRV2_FORMAT, but keep using the stored disk version at deserialization time. That's incompatible with 20509, but an easier fix for 0.21.\r\n* Change the `anchors.dat` file format to have a version number. That could be done now (but is a pretty invasive change at rc3...), or could be done later by encoding it as an \"invalid CAddress\" first as a marker...",

We then ensure that bitcoin attempts to reconnect to that anchor address on restart.\r\n\r\nTo compute the addrv2 serialization of the onion v3 address, I added logic to `CAddress` in `messages.py`. This new logic is covered by extending `p2p_addrv2_relay.py` to include an onion v3 address. Future work will be adding coverage for ipv6, torv2 and cjdns in these modules and also `feature_proxy.py`\r\n\r\nAlso includes de/serialization unit test for `CAddress` in test framework.\r\n",
