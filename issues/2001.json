Debug log showed his clock was exactly 24 hours fast.\n\nThis is probably unoptimal.  Showing out of sync when the last block is old makes sense, but there should probably be some additional text about your clock being wrong when your peers all say you're 1440 minutes off.\n",

If you miss the original message and you don't tend to scan backwards past the most recent startup, you'll see a comforting `LoadBlockIndexDB: hashBestChain=...` and `No coin database inconsistencies in last N blocks` at startup, and you'll see the node acquiring peers; you might see more `ConnectInputs failed` and `AcceptToMemoryPool: non-final` than usual, but nothing explicit to alert you to the fact that the longest chain is considered invalid, nor why.\n\n@laanwj suggests \"'timestamp too far in the future' is a temporary condition, it probably shouldn't cache it indefinitely\"; failing that, maybe it's easy enough to get caught in this trap that it merits an extra startup-time breadcrumb in the logs.\n",
