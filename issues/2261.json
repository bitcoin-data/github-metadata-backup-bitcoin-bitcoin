I'm not talking about keeping up with the blockchain, that would be perfectly fine, I'm talking about an initial phase where it doesn't even respond to requests: any call to it returns \"error: couldn't connect to server\" (either from command line or from web).\n\nIs it a known issue, is there a workaround?\n\nOSX 10.6.8, bitcoind 0.7.0 (but happened with earlier versions too). Installed on the main and only hard disk, which is not encrypted.\n",
