I will try and test this later to see if there is any difference to block 600k again.\r\n\r\nBy block 400,000 bitcoin core v27.0 peak usage hit `VmPeak:  5048020 kB`, which is approx the same (marginally higher than v28.0) at this stage where it too roughly levels out.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to run this further than the block 550k I am up to now, as these results seem so similar. My read is that:\r\n\r\n- Electrs takes 50% more ram than bitcoin core (seen max of 8GB)\r\n- Bitcoin Core v27.0 and v28.0 are approximately equal in requiring ~5GB RAM to host an electrs sync (to block 600k)\r\n- Running these both on a system with only 4GB (maybe even 8GB too) should be expected to cause OOM killing or heavy swapping",
