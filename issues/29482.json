    "title": "Inconsistent behavior when overriding bitcoin.conf options from settings.json",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen `bitcoind` is started with the following configuration files:\r\n\r\n`settings.json`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"listen\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`bitcoin.conf`:\r\n```\r\nlisten=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it does not listen. This is expected. Options from `settings.json` override ones from `bitcoin.conf`. Both options co-exist in `ArgsManager::m_settings::rw_settings` (listen=0) and `ArgsManager::m_settings::ro_config` (listen=1). Then `ArgsManager::GetBoolArg()` selects the value from `rw_settings`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nWhat should be the behavior with the following?\r\n\r\n`settings.json`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"listen\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`bitcoin.conf`:\r\n```\r\nlistenonion=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that for consistency with the above, it should start and not listen. That is, `listenonion=1` from `bitcoin.conf` should be overriden / set to 0. But instead `bitcoind` refuses to start:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoind\r\nError: Cannot set -listen=0 together with -listenonion=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n* start `bitcoin-qt`, go to settings -> network and remove the checkbox from \"Allow incoming connections\"\r\n* shut down\r\n* add `listenonion=1` in `bitcoin.conf` (might as well be done as first step)\r\n* start `bitcoin-qt` - it refuses to start with `Error: Cannot set -listen=0 together with -listenonion=1`\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\nCompiled from source\r\n\r\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\r\n\r\nmaster@7143d4388407ab3d12005e55a02d5e8f334e4dc9\r\n\r\n### Operating system and version\r\n\r\nany\r\n\r\n### Machine specifications\r\n\r\n_No response_",

      "body": "`listen=0` `listenonion=1` is not possible technically. Let me explain. The name `listenonion=` is really confusing and I got confused by it again. Maybe it is time to rename it. It has nothing to do with TCP listening (as in [`bind(2)`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html) and [`listen(2)`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html)). What `listenonion=` does is to connect to the Tor daemon and automatically create and configure a Tor service, like _\"Hey, Tor, please start listening on `foobar.onion:8333` and redirect all connections to that to `127.0.0.1:8334`\"_. It should be called `autocreatetorservice=`. Obviously, if we do not TCP listen on `127.0.0.1:8334` (controlled by `listen=`) then this cannot work.\r\n\r\nIt is further confusing because we can listen for onion connections even when `listenonion=0` - if the Tor daemon is configured manually to redirect connections to `foobar.onion:8333` to `127.0.0.1:8334` (where we run with `bind=127.0.0.1:8334=onion` which is the default).\r\n\r\n> Adding the listenonion setting to the gui so it is visible (the proxy settings already have options for tor, so this would make the listening and proxy options more consistent)\r\n\r\nIf this route is taken, then the GUI should only allow the following combinations:\r\n`listen=0` `listenonion=0`\r\n`listen=1` `listenonion=0`\r\n`listen=1` `listenonion=1`",

      "body": "I think that mostly makes sense, and definitely the most direct way to fix this issue would be one of the GUI fixes (making the Allow Incoming Connections checkbox disable both listen options, or improving the GUI error message and making it nonfatal, or adding a GUI option to control -listenonion).\r\n\r\nAnd I agree the options are really confusing and poorly named. IMO we should deprecate -listen, -listenonion, -bind, -whitebind options while interpreting them for backwards compatibility, and design a new option that lets you directly specify what addresses, ports, and sockets you want to listen on using a general syntax like [socat's](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat).\r\n\r\nI just think, in theory, `listen=0 listenonion=1` could do a sensible thing and disable listening in general while still autoconfiguring tor and listening exclusively on the localhost onion service port. Probably not worth the implementation complexity, but I don't think it would be \"not possible technically\" unless I am missing something",
