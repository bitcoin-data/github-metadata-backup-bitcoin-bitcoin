    "body": "Assuming that the machine of a maintainer is compromised, it is possible to have the merge commit modified before sign and push.\n\nAs we already have the requirement that \"everyone without exception contributes patch proposals using pull requests.\" [[1]](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/37f9a1f627c0995d89b62923e75cd092600894f9/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-workflow), I'd propose that we add the requirement that a pull request can only be merged when there is no merge conflict to be solved. Thus, verify-commits could not only check the signature of every merge commit but also fail when the merge commit modifies more code than the branch did that is about to be merged.\n",

It's a local check and assuming a (un)intentionally compromised machine, it renders itself useless.\n\n> I do think it should be possible for non-top-level merges (so those part of pull requests). Merges with conflict resolve exist for a good reason, and I don't think the use of git to accomplish development tasks (as well as convenience for contributors) should be unnecessarily restricted for paranoia reasons.\n\n​\nI agree. Keep in mind, that there would be no further restrictions on code contributors. Changing the workflow would only place a burden on reviewers. (E.g. having at least one reviewer sign the commit hash of a pull) \n",
