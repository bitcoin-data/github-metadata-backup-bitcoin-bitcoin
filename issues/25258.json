    "body": "There have been a couple of old attempts to enable parallel compact block downloads, see #9447 and #10984. There are additional notes in #16172.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that we currently might request missing transactions for a new block from the first peer to announce the block to us; but if that peer is a miner (or close to a miner), that peer might be busy (eg it might be in ConnectTip), and not able to reply quickly, while some other node has meanwhile obtained the block and is able to quickly give you the few transactions you're missing.\r\n\r\nTherefore, at some point we should pick up the patches in those earlier PRs, or otherwise solve this :)",

Due to recent mempool chop, the chances of requiring a round-trip for slightly-later-but-behaving high bandwidth peer's cb goes way up, and currently cannot be accommodated.\r\n\r\ncouple of questions to think about:\r\n1) should the 2nd download only work for outbound connections? currently there are 3 hb peers possible, and only one outbound is \"protected\". Sybil nodes can take up 2 inbound slots pretty easily. Perhaps if first to announce is outbound, we allow an inbound as second as well?\r\n2) is 10 transaction diff as per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10984 reasonable with today's mempool characteristics?",

That's at tension with the potential block relay speedup for non-listening peers, but at least non-listening peers aren't as vulnerable to sybil nodes. \r\n2) Could reduce number of concurrent to 2, instead of 3, for non-listening only, or both modes, to reduce worst-case overhead/funneling to listening nodes\r\n3) Could enable low-bandwidth compact outbound nodes instead by initiating a compact block fetch when a low-bandwidth outbound peer offers a header\r\n4) Could add timers/schedules to give every announce attempt a \"fair chance\" before issuing another `getblocktxn` without unduly slowing down block relay.\r\n\r\nA number of these would benefit greatly from a \"blockrequests.cpp\" style refactor to make this all more understandable.",
