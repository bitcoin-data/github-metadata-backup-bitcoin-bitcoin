    "title": "RFC: separate kernel logging infrastructure",
    "body": "tl;dr: kernel logging is cumbersome. I propose we layer logging so we can enable structured logging and a much simplified kernel logging interface without overcomplicating node logging.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe `bitcoinkernel` library (#27587) [exposes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b26762bdcb941096ccc6f53c3fb5a7786ad735e7/src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.h#L698-L778) functionality to interface with the kernel logging. This includes registering callbacks for log statements, level/category filtering, string formatting options, and more.\n\nKernel logging has a few problems:\n- **P1**: [callbacks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b26762bdcb941096ccc6f53c3fb5a7786ad735e7/src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.h#L304) operate on formatted strings, so users need to parse the string to get the timestamp, category, level, ... based on which options are set. This is cumbersome, brittle, and inefficient.\n- **P2**: the [filtering interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b26762bdcb941096ccc6f53c3fb5a7786ad735e7/src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.h#L737) is not really intuitive, requiring users to call combinations of `btck_logging_set_level_category` and `btck_logging_enable_category` when they want to produce `debug` or `trace` logs. The level/category system makes sense for node, because it directly controls what gets written to disk and stdout, and there are quite a lot more categories producing logs. Kernel doesn't really need this - users control what happens to the logs, and can do any filtering/manipulation in the callback they provide.\n- **P3**: the node logging infrastructure has quite a bit more functionality than is necessary for a library, including ratelimiting, log formatting, outputting, buffering, ... This introduces unnecessary code and interface complexity.\n- **P4**: it [uses](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b26762bdcb941096ccc6f53c3fb5a7786ad735e7/src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.cpp#L237) the global (node) logger, which goes against the otherwise context local (or stateless) design of the `bitcoinkernel` interface.\n\n## Approach\n\nI propose we address problems P1, P2 and P3 by layering the logging infrastructure. Roughly, this would mean:\n1. Implement a minimal `util::log::Logger` class (see [Appendix](#Appendix)) that dispatches structured log entries to registered callbacks. This is a low-level logger that does not perform formatting, rate limiting, or category filtering - it simply dispatches to callbacks.\n2. Refactor `BCLog::Logger` into `BCLog::Sink`, which registers a callback on `util::log::GetLogger()` and handles all node-specific functionality (category filtering, rate limiting, file output, formatting, ...).\n3. Update kernel code to include `util/log.h` instead of `logging.h`. The existing logging macros (`LogInfo`, `LogDebug`, etc.) continue to work unchanged.\n4. Simplify `bitcoinkernel` C API to reflect the simpler `util::log::Logger` interface (structured logging, level-based, ...), we can now completely remove `btck_LoggingOptions`.\n5. Remove `logging.h` and `logging.cpp` from the kernel library completely.\n\n**Note:** I'm leaving problem P4 out of scope for this proposal. I think it already has sufficient merit with a global logger, and I want to keep scope limited. However, I do believe layered logging infrastructure will make implementing P4 easier.\n\n## Balance\n\nThe main benefits and downsides of this approach:\n\n**Benefits:**\n- **B1:** a kernel-native structured logging interface that minimizes complexity and makes for a much more ergonomic interface, enabling structured logging instead of string parsing.\n- **B2:** doesn't complicate node logging purely for the purpose of accommodating diverging requirements for kernel. For example, I suspect projects like #30342 should be much easier with layered kernel logging.\n- **B3:** reduces friction if/when node migrates to use the public `bitcoinkernel` interface by having already completely decoupled logging.\n- ... (what have I missed?)\n\n**Downsides:**\n- **D1:** levels-based filtering has some performance overhead by formatting all (kernel) debug log strings instead of just the subset of categories specified. Note that this _only_ applies when debug is enabled, and that kernel has a lot less logging than node.\n- ... (what have I missed?)\n\n## Scope\n\nI have implemented this approach in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...stickies-v:bitcoin:2025-12/kernel-logging-layering. Most of the changes are quite straightforward, including refactoring `BCLog::Logger` to `BCLog::Sink`, adding tests, and adding a `util::log::Logger` interface.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Interfaces\n#### util::log::Logger\n\n```cpp\nclass Logger\n{\npublic:\n    using Callback = std::function<void(const Entry&)>;\n    using CallbackHandle = std::list<Callback>::iterator;\n\n    //!

      "body": "Nice work. The new interface proposed here and implemented in your branch seem much better than the current interface, and well thought out. I feel like we could pretty easily wire it into the existing Logger class without introducing a new class and new macros though, and without needing to change validation & util code.\n\nI wonder if there may be difficulties doing that I'm not aware of, or if it just seemed easier to start with a clean state in the current branch.\n\nI do think it would preferable to have one Logger class and one set of macros instead of two. I also think using kernel logging functions in util code (only `src/util/fs_helpers.cpp` right now but it seems like usage might expand) would probably not be desirable, since the dependency is supposed  to to the other way with kernel depending on util, not util depending on kernel. Also, the wallet and GUI are supposed to use util but should not depend on the kernel. This could be another reason to want to try improving the `Logger` class instead of replacing it.",

      "body": "Thanks for looking into this, @ryanofsky! Upgrading vs separating is indeed the important decision to make here. I initially started wiring it into the existing `Logger` class, but changed my approach when I realized that when `kernel` becomes its own project, they will each need to have their own code anyway. Complicating `node` logging to accommodate kernel's different requirements, to then take it away again, feels like unnecessary friction and code complexity (e.g. plumbing a level-based system on top of a cateogory-level-based system). On the other hand, prematurely optimizing for a future split that may never happen is a risk. _(note: I don't think we're prematurely optimizing, because the kernel logger is so light-weight)_\n\nA different approach that I'm happy to explore, and I think could make more sense than wiring low-level `kernel` into higher-level `node` logging, is to ~move the `kernel::Logger` to `util::Logger`, and have _all_ logging (instead of just `kernel`) go through these structured callbacks. This way, the low-level logging interface is in `util`, and all the opinionated node stuff (i/o, ratelimiting, log formatting, ...) would live in `common`. This would mean node logging fundamentally also becomes level-based (i.e. debug string formatting is all-or-nothing), but I think that's a pretty small price to pay?\n\n> and new macros though, and without needing to change validation\n\nIn the mvp branch, I chose new `KernelLog...` macros just to keep things straightforward, and I'd be open to using macro/compile flag magic to minimize the diff there. However, I think the reality is that logging signatures in kernel code will have to change (for every single callsite) to make it context-aware, so I don't think a new macro name is all that important?\n\n>  I also think using kernel logging functions in util code...\n\nI agree with most of your observations in this paragraph, and kernel macros should not be leaking into util, wallet, GUI. I think the proper solution here is to remove logging from util though. In my view, low-level (i.e. util) code should not be logging at all. I've implemented one way of doing that in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...stickies-v:bitcoin:2025-12/util-no-logging. It seems the scope of that change is rather limited, but there are many approaches possible, so that would warrant its own discussion.\n",

The C interface you laid out looks really nice too and should be easier to wire against whatever is required.\n\n> hey will each need to have their own code anyway\n\nOne point that might be nice to mention here too is that we are also defining a bunch of categories that the kernel should not have to know about.\n\nReading through your comment, I actually like what you are laying out as an alternative. Maybe a refinement of that idea could be to split the logger into a low-level and high-level implementation. Both can be implemented as global instances for now. The low-level class could take care of formatting, level detection, and providing a unified macro for all users. It can then feed into a higher level class through a callback. For a global logger, this would mean we'd retain a global low level logger, and introduce a global higher-level instance. We only initialize the global callback into the higher level logger when it is actually required by the respective binary, similar to what we do currently with the translations. For the kernel library itself, we can then surface this callback to the user through the API with the interface you are suggesting here.\n\n> This would mean node logging fundamentally also becomes level-based (i.e. debug string formatting is all-or-nothing), but I think that's a pretty small price to pay?\n\nI'm not really following why we can't have a set of categories defined to filter against pre formatting.

So far, it seems like it'll be a much bigger code diff than the [seperation branch](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...stickies-v:bitcoin:2025-12/kernel-logging-separation) (because a _lot_ of `logging.{h,cpp}` code will need to move around, but there should be 1) less duplication and 2) more contained logging logic, so I think overall this might work out nicely.\n\n> I'm not really following why we can't have a set of categories defined to filter against pre formatting. Are you suggesting this, because we'd ideally want to split off non-kernel categories?\n\nCategory filtering to me feels like a high-level (i/o) logging output concern rather than a low-level logging concern. We _could_ make the low-level interface filter based on categories, but that I think would needlessly clutter the interface for users that don't need it (incl kernel), so I'd much rather keep it purely levels-based. So for e.g. `node`, that would mean that if only a single debug category is enabled, all debug logs would be formatted*, but only the one enabled category printed. Unless measurements indicate it really is too much overhead, I think that's not going to be a big deal when you're in debug mode already?\n\n*note: there are 2 formatting steps: 1 the `LogInfo(fmt, args...)` formatting, and then 2) the formatting where we produce a single string containing timestamp, level, msg, ... I'm generally talking about the first step. The second is of course only done when needed.",

The Layering approach turned out much less invasive than my initial attempts showed, and now has my preference.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n- we distinguish between a (low-level) logger that produces log statements (`util::log::Logger`) and (higher-level) log sinks (`BCLog::Sink`, `btck_LoggingConnection`) that consume the logs by registering a callback on the logger.\n- the `bitcoinkernel.h` API is ~identical between both versions, as are the `util::log::Logger` and `kernel::Logger` interfaces\n- the total diff is quite small, ~500 lines diff excluding tests, including complete removal of `logging.{h,cpp}` from kernel\n\nConceptually, it's quite similar to the earlier Separation approach, but just organizes the code differently, reducing code churn and duplication.\n\n@ryanofsky I think this addresses your [concerns](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/34062#issuecomment-3647259207) about duplicated macros, about util code depending on kernel code, and about minimizing changes to validation and util code. It still introduces a new class, I don't immediately see an elegant way around that that also allows `kernel` to not depend on node logging code. Does that seem like a reasonable enough trade-off to you to warrant opening a PR and discuss the details?\n\nI'll open a PR if/when people are happy about the concept and initial approach, that's probably a better place to discuss code in more depth.\n",

Changing all the validation logs prefix the macro with `Kernel` and changing `BCLog::` to `kernel::Category` is not an improvement.\n\n> * **D2:** levels-based filtering has some performance overhead by formatting all (kernel) debug log strings instead of just the subset of categories specified.\n\nThat pretty much destroys the use case of Trace logging which is intended for high-rate logging that's probably not performant enough for regular usage. Which is fine today, because we only do trace logging in the wallet. But being able to do it for mempool analysis/debugging would also be useful.\n\nLikewise for:\n\n> Category filtering to me feels like a high-level (i/o) logging output concern rather than a low-level logging concern.\n\nThat's not the case.\n\nAs far as the problem statements go:\n\n> * **P1**: [callbacks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b26762bdcb941096ccc6f53c3fb5a7786ad735e7/src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.h#L304) operate on formatted strings,\n\nOutside of the kernel, the callbacks are only used in tests, so changing how the callbacks work seems trivial, not justification for a major rework.\n\n>     * **P2**: the [filtering interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b26762bdcb941096ccc6f53c3fb5a7786ad735e7/src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.h#L737) is not really intuitive, requiring users to call combinations of `btck_logging_set_level_category` and `btck_logging_enable_category` when they want to produce `debug` or `trace` logs.\n\nThat interface isn't a good design even for the node software. #34038 removes it from being exposed to users (via the `-loglevel` config option), so that a [followup](https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/tree/202512-log-atomic) can simplify it further.\n\nAt that point, having `btck_logging_trace(VALIDATION)` or `btck_logging_setlevel(VALIDATION, TRACE)` to enable trace logging for validation at a cost of slower validation, seems fine to me.\n\n> I propose we address problems P1, P2 and P3 by completely separating the kernel logging infrastructure from the node logging infrastructure. Roughly, this would mean:\n> \n>     1. Implement a minimal `kernel::Logger` interface\n\nThis seems exactly backwards to me; I would instead have approached it as \"let's rip out the node specific stuff from logging into node/loghandler, and have it register itself in a similar way to how kernel users will register their log handling code\".",

I wish I'd updated the Issue description earlier, because I think a lot of your concerns were already addressed in the new approach. Apologies for not doing that earlier.\n\n> For example, https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commit/57e6ba1739dff27b78819fbb9594ec88daff609f\n\nStructured callbacks can be done with a much smaller diff indeed, but I think it doesn't address two concerns:\n1) a lot of the `node` logging logic is irrelevant for `kernel` (e.g. non-kernel categories, ratelimiting, string formatting, ...), so keeping `node` logging logic separate would be good\n2) it limits how much we can simplify the `bitcoinkernel` logging interface, forcing the user to do category configuration\n\n> This seems exactly backwards to me; I would instead have approached it as \"let's rip out the node specific stuff from logging into node/loghandler, and have it register itself in a similar way to how kernel users will register their log handling code\".\n\nAgreed, see [an earlier update](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/34062#issuecomment-3667169341) (which is now the documented approach in this Issue).\n\n> That pretty much destroys the use case of Trace logging which is intended for high-rate logging that's probably not performant enough for regular usage. Which is fine today, because we only do trace logging in the wallet. But being able to do it for mempool analysis/debugging would also be useful.\n\nMy understanding of your concern is: \"with level-only filtering at the low (`util::log::Logger`) level, enabling `Trace` means paying formatting overhead for all trace logs regardless of category, making high-frequency trace logging impractical.\" Is my understanding correct? I think we'll have to add a LOT more `Trace` logging before that actually becomes a concern. I'm not sure we ever will, but if/when we ever need it, I think that can still be easily addressed later by adding a category filter predicate to `util::log::Logger`? Optimizing for that now seems premature to me? _(Just in case there's any confusion, my suggested approach still uses levels-based filtering to avoid unnecessary log string formatting.)_",

Compared to the [previous approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/34062#issuecomment-3667169341), the main changes are:\n- `Dispatcher` (previously `util::log::Logger`) is now instantiated with a `FilterFunc filter` predicate, that enables `util` to remain oblivious to the `logging.h` level/category setting logic whilst still allowing log consumers (such as `BCLog::Logger`) to avoid overhead (e.g string formatting, lambda evaluation) when logs don't pass the filter. I think this should address @ajtowns' main outstanding [concern](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/34062#issuecomment-3677360573)? It also avoids the need for `BCLog::Logger` to synchronize its minimum levels with `util::log::Dispatcher`'s minimum level, simplifying the implementation in some ways (but complicating it in others, e.g. requiring a new global `Dispatcher`).\n- rename `util::log::Logger` to `util::log::Dispatcher` so we can keep the `BCLog::Logger` name unchanged and minimize unnecessary code churn.\n\nI'd be grateful to hear your feedback on this new approach on the PR. Also thanks to @ryanofsky for giving me ideas (offline) to refine the approach.",

      "body": "> They can decide whether and how they want to filter their log messages based on level, category and/or source location, as long as all this information is made available to them.\n\nClient-side filtering was a big driver behind my thinking too, but I also agree with @ajtowns's concerns about not incurring unnecessary overhead for logs that are later dropped. I don't think a user who's interested only in Info level logs should be forced to pay for all the (sometimes expensive, e.g. calculating memory usage) Debug and Trace statements that exist in the codebase. Also keep in mind that kernel and node share a lot of code, so we have to make sure changes make sense for all subsystems. This has led me to the approach adopted in #34374, where filtering is possible but it's entirely up to the client to implement it, so most of this complexity is kept out of kernel.\n\n> If clients want to write their logs to multiple places, they can do so with a single log handler. \n\nI agree. I don't see the need for more than a single connection per context, but I think supporting multiple logging contexts makes sense given our current context-aware interface.\n\n> A single log handler can be active at any given time.\n\nThere is an argument to be made for that approach, but I think it is awkward that some part of the interface is context-aware (e.g. ChainstateManager) and another part (e.g. logging) is global. I think, to keep the conversations somewhat focused, your thoughts on having a single handler might best be channeled to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30342 (and see also e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30338 for a previous discussion)\n\n",
