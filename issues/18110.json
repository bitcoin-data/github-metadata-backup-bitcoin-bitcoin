    "title": "build: Explore building with musl as libc",
    "body": "This has been discussed briefly with theuni and fanquake in the past, but I want to put it out there as an issue for more general discussion. I recommend reading through musl's project introduction [here](https://www.musl-libc.org/intro.html). Reproduced:\r\n\r\n> musl provides consistent quality and implementation behavior from tiny embedded systems to full-fledged servers. Minimal machine-specific code means less chance of breakage on minority architectures and better success with “write once run everywhere” C development.\r\n>\r\n> musl's efficiency is unparalleled in Linux libc implementations. Designed from the ground up for static linking, musl carefully avoids pulling in large amounts of code or data that the application will not use. Dynamic linking is also efficient; by integrating the entire standard library implementation, including threads, math, and even the dynamic linker itself into a single shared object, most of the startup time and memory overhead of dynamic linking have been eliminated.\r\n>\r\n> musl features the first post-NPTL implementation of POSIX threads for Linux, and the first aimed at complete conformance and robustness. Thread cancellation has been re-designed to avoid serious race conditions in the original NPTL design. As for efficiency, the whole threads implementation weighs in at around 10-20k depending on target architecture and compiler settings.\r\n>\r\n> Not only the threads implementation, but all code in musl has been designed for realtime-quality robustness. Low-memory or resource exhaustion conditions are never fatal. musl has no unnecessary dynamic allocation and no unrecoverable late failures. All error conditions can be detected and handled by applications; interfaces for which an application could not reasonably handle failure do not fail.\r\n>\r\n> Using musl maximizes application deployability. Its permissive MIT license is compatible with all FOSS licenses, static-linking-friendly, and makes commercial use painless too. Binaries statically linked with musl have no external dependencies, even for features like DNS lookups or character set conversions that are implemented with dynamic loading on glibc. An application can really be deployed as a single binary file and run on any machine with the appropriate instruction set architecture and Linux kernel or Linux syscall ABI emulation layer.\r\n>\r\n> Finally, musl has simple source code and source tree layout, so it’s easy to customize or track down the cause of unexpected behavior or bugs, or simply learn how the library works.\r\n\r\nA few more resources for people to consider:\r\n\r\nIn-depth discussion of some design decisions: https://wiki.musl-libc.org/design-concepts.html\r\nA comparison of different libcs: http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html\r\nComprehensive compatibility information: https://wiki.musl-libc.org/compatibility.html\r\nFAQ: https://www.musl-libc.org/faq.html\r\n\r\nPerhaps being able to build fully-static Bitcoin Core binaries is a worthwhile features, as I've heard that glibc supports static builds in theory, but has many quirks in practice.",

This is because the C++ libraries and headers are missing from the musl include/library path. The existing libstdc++ is actually compatible with musl in most cases and could be used by copying it into the musl library path, but the C++ header files are usually not compatible. One option may be rebuilding just\r\n05:23 < wumpus> libstdc++ against musl; however, if C++ support is needed, it's recommended just to build a native toolchain targetting musl. \"\r\n05:35 < wumpus> I guess there's no way around using something like alpine linux\r\n06:22 < wumpus> effetctively, building C++ for musl requires a full cross toolchain; using a cross-compilation toolchain for the native platform, might be advantageous from a determinism perspective though\r\n06:26 < wumpus> insulated the build from what happens to be installed on the system\r\n07:04 < wumpus> dongcarl cfields what do you think about switching linux builds to musl libc static builds?\r\n07:10 < wumpus> it has the advantage that the binaries work pretty much everywhere instead of only on a limited range of libc versions, and it's starting to be untenable to maintain libc compatibility this far back\r\n07:17 < dongcarl> not opposed... with Guix we won't have to maintain libc compatibility, since we won't be forced to upgrade libc version by ubuntu... but I do see the binary works everywhere advantage\r\n07:18 < wumpus> sure, you can build against a old libc version instead of the libc-compat workaround, but you'd have just as much trouble supporting getauxval\r\n07:19 < wumpus> it doesn't exist in 2.11 no matter how you build against it\r\n",

      "body": "Nice work!\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to see benchmarks of sync performance. I don't expect that much of a difference, but it could go either way. The glibc allocator is quite efficient, I think musl's is somewhat simpler and slower in some cases. On the other hand, static linking can reduce call overhead (especially wih LTO, but that's a matter for another time).\r\n\r\n> @laanwj Ah yes good point. I don't think it'd be too weird if we end up supporting building everything other than bitcoin-qt statically with musl?\r\n\r\nI don't see a strong reason why not. Having some more requirements on the system (with regard to installed libraries, and e.g. fonts) for the GUI than for the other tools is not unreasonable. Thinking of it it's very little different from how things are now.",

          "body": "After #21016, `boost::shared_mutex` will basically be the last component of Boost Thread that Bitcoin Core is using. However, [a comment in #16684](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16684#issuecomment-726214696), pointed out that `std::shared_mutex` may be unsafe to use, when coupled with a range of glibc versions ~2.26->2.29, which may block our adoption and the removal of Boost Thread. \r\n\r\nNote that the comment first links to [\"rdlock stalls indefinitely on an unlocked pthread rwlock\"](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23861), but then to the [Ubuntu bugtracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/+bug/1864864), which is actually for a different pthread bug: [\"pthread_rwlock_trywrlock results in hang\"](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23844). This PR contains a modified version of the code to reproduce the second bug, for which a backport was done for Ubuntu 18.04s glibc (2.27-3ubuntu1.3).\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce the hanging behaviour using the following. (You could also use any demos from the linked bug reports).\r\n\r\nRun a Bionic container, and install build dependencies. Clone the source and checkout this branch:\r\n```bash\r\ndocker run -it --rm ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash\r\n\r\napt update && apt upgrade -y\r\napt install git build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config bsdmainutils python3 libevent-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev -y\r\n\r\ngit clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\r\ngit fetch origin pull/21022/head:21022\r\ngit checkout 21022\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfigure, disabling the wallet (unrelated) and enabling glibc back compat, so that our sanity checks are enabled:\r\n```bash\r\n./autogen.sh\r\n./configure --disable-wallet --enable-glibc-back-compat\r\nmake src/bitcoind -j8\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore running bitcoind, check which version of libc you have installed. `23844` was fixed in `1.3`, so running `1.4` should mean no issues:\r\n```bash\r\napt-cache policy libc6\r\nlibc6:\r\n  Installed: 2.27-3ubuntu1.4\r\n  Candidate: 2.27-3ubuntu1.4\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun bitcoind\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind\r\nTesting pthread trylock_wr\r\n\r\n2021-01-28T13:24:39Z Bitcoin Core version v21.99.0-1e601c9d60f9 (release build)\r\n2021-01-28T13:24:39Z Assuming ancestors of block 0000000000000000000b9d2ec5a352ecba0592946514a92f14319dc2b367fc72 have valid signatures.\r\n2021-01-28T13:24:39Z Setting nMinimumChainWork=00000000000000000000000000000000000000001533efd8d716a517fe2c5008\r\n...\r\n# quit\r\n```\r\n\r\nDowngrade libc to `1.2`. You may need to uninstall `libc6-dev` first, otherwise it will block the downgrade of `libc6`:\r\n```bash\r\napt remove libc6-dev -y\r\napt install libc6=2.27-3ubuntu1.2 -y\r\n\r\n# check that you're running 1.2\r\napt-cache policy libc6\r\nlibc6:\r\n  Installed: 2.27-3ubuntu1.2\r\n  Candidate: 2.27-3ubuntu1.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRun `bitcoind` again. Note that this will *hang*. You will not be able to quit.\r\n```bash\r\n# if it doesn't hang, quit and retry\r\n./src/bitcoind\r\nTesting pthread trylock_wr\r\n\r\n.... hanging\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to have more discussion around how we approach these sort of \"lower down the stack\" issues:\r\n\r\n* what sort of bug or issue warrants us from excluding a std library feature, i.e `std::shared_mutex`, from use? If you looked at the glibc issue tracker right now, you'd no doubt find half a dozen bugs across multiple versions of glibc that you may think warrant us excluding various things.\r\n* How widespread does the issue have to be? If it's in a single glibc version that is nearly EOL, that is obviously less of an issue compared to something affecting most recent versions.\r\n* how (in)tolerant are we of assuming that users are taking backports?\r\n* do we need to be more aggressive with runtime sanity checks? Should we be trying to detect more \"broken things\" that are applicable to us? \r\n\r\nIt would certainly be unfortunate if migrating to more standard library components was blocked for extended periods (Ubuntu Bionic is LTS until mid 2023), due to these kinds of bugs.",

          "body": "This proof of concept is one approach to static [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/) based builds. It leverages [musl-cross-make](https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make) to compile a musl libc targeting toolchain, made up of GCC 10.3.0 + binutils 2.37 + musl libc 1.2.3, and then uses that toolchain to build our depends libraries, and ultimately `bitcoind`.\r\n\r\nMore than likely we'd take a different approach in Guix for (potentially) release builds, however, something like this could exist in depends, and provide an alternative to building against glibc outside Guix. Or, this may well end up being something we just throw away in favour of a better approach; still lots to be thought about here.\r\n\r\nOnly tested compiling on, for `x86_64-pc-linux-gnu` so far.\r\n\r\nYou can use it as follows:\r\n```bash\r\nmake -C depends/ -j9 NO_QT=1 NO_WALLET=1 NO_UPNP=1 NO_ZMQ=1 NO_NATPMP=1 USE_MUSL_LIBC=1 HOST=x86_64-linux-musl\r\n./autogen.sh\r\nCONFIG_SITE=/path/to/your/bitcoin/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-musl/share/config.site ./configure --enable-reduce-exports --enable-lto LDFLAGS=\"-Wl,-O2\" LIBTOOL_APP_LDFLAGS=\"-all-static\"\r\nmake src/bitcoind\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe end result (once stripped) is a ~10mb static `bitcoind`:\r\n```bash\r\nldd src/bitcoind\r\n\tstatically linked\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you see:\r\n```bash\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'\r\n  what():  locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid\r\nAborted (core dumped)\r\n```\r\nwhen running, pass `LC_ALL=C`. i.e `LC_ALL=C src/bitcoind`. \r\n\r\nI've taken the binary onto a few different system / inside VMs, and am running a full sync.\r\n\r\nNote that all dependencies do compile, except for Qt (build issue with FreeType I have not investigated), I've just excluded all optional dependencies from the depends build above.\r\n\r\nWhen building, you may see warnings about libraries, such as `libstdc++`, as having been moved, during linking, and/or other warnings, from dependencies, such as sqlite, due to `-flto` usage.\r\n\r\nRelated to #18110.",

There's no structure or plan to it, nor an end in sight. See e.g #24659 #24369 #24340  #23555 #23299 #23255 #23208 #23179.\r\n\r\nThe whole idea of a syscall sandbox is fundamentally a layer violation. It's untenable when dynamic linking is involved, or dependencies we don't know A to Z, with evolving user-kernel space APIs. See also discussion here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24758#issuecomment-1088507575\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure it addresses relevant risks in our case. The P2P thread communicates with the outside world and the scope of an exploit to gain full RCE can ostensibly be restricted by sandboxing it. However there are bigger risks within the bitcoind/-qt process itself: messing with consensus code, stealing wallet keys. A thread-based sandbox provides only minimal protection here.\r\n\r\nIt's also single platform (Linux x86_64), and all the work would basically be duplicated for each platform added as the syscalls differ subtly.",
