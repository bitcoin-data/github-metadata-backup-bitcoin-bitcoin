Standard steps to build on OSX\r\n2. `./bitcoind` does not work and spawns the following error:\r\n```\r\nAssertion failed: ((pindexFirstNeverProcessed != nullptr) == (pindex->nChainTx == 0)), function CheckBlockIndex, file validation.cpp, line 4203.\r\nAbort trap: 6\r\n```\r\nStrangely enough, `bitcoin-cli` works, so I think this might be isolated to `bitcoind` and similar.\r\n\r\nI Didn't observe this earlier, think it may have occurred recently (or I may have done something which causes this). Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
