I turned on this machine today and trying to access a wallet but the wallet loading takes forever and never returns success or fail!\r\nI have then updated the core to 26.0.0 and that didn't make any difference.\r\nEvery other aspect seems to be working fine include creating and loading the newly created wallets.\r\nI have tried the console but again not difference \r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 15 53 45](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/19202935/d0f34cee-4381-4562-af19-befaff26acba)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nExpect success or fail prompt with an error message on fail.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nNot sure how that can be replicated without sharing my wallet!\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\nPre-built binaries\r\n\r\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\r\n\r\n26.0.0\r\n\r\n### Operating system and version\r\n\r\nLinux Debain 11 bullseye\r\n\r\n### Machine specifications\r\n\r\nThe OS runs on proxmos VM, which runs on hp rack server.

(search for where it says \"Rescan started from block xxx\").\r\nAlso, can you share your hardware information please.\r\n\r\n> why is it still taking a long time (30 sec) to load after the rescan? it used to be instant 8 months ago!\r\n\r\nThe wallet stores the last scanned block.
