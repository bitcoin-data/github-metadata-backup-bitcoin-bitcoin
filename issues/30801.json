    "title": "cmake: Installed static kernel library is unusable",
    "body": "Since the move to cmake, the kernel static library that is installed after a `cmake --install build` is unusable. It basically lacks all symbols, besides those defined in the kernel library target. This was a problem before where some libtool and symbol visibility [issues](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25008#issuecomment-1440326006) led to the libsecp static library having to be linked too. Additionally installing libsecp was easily done though, by changing to the `secp256k1` directory and running `make install`.\r\n\r\nPreviously, e.g. on the v28 release branch, configuring with `--with-experimental-kernel-lib --disable-shared`, then doing a `make install` and `make install` in the `secp256k1` directory provided working libraries. This could be verified by successfully compiling `bitcoin-chainstate.cpp` without the build system:\r\n```\r\ng++ -std=c++20 -o test_chainstate src/bitcoin-chainstate.cpp -I/home/drgrid/bitcoin/src -L/usr/local/lib -lbitcoinkernel -lsecp256k1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the same is attempted on current master, configuring with `-DBUILD_KERNEL_LIB=ON -DBUILD_SHARRED_LIBS=OFF`, then doing a `cmake --install build`, will make the same g++ command error with e.g:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/usr/bin/ld: ./build/src/kernel/./build/src/kernel/./src/hash.cpp:89:(.text+0x2f6): undefined reference to `CSHA256::Write(unsigned char const*, unsigned long)'\r\n/usr/bin/ld: ./build/src/kernel/./build/src/kernel/./src/hash.cpp:89:(.text+0x306): undefined reference to `CSHA256::Finalize(unsigned char*)'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to compile `bitcoin-chainstate` through cmake, the following is visible in the logs, which enumerates the missing libraries:\r\n```\r\n[100%] Linking CXX executable bitcoin-chainstate\r\ncd /home/drgrid/bitcoin/build/src && /usr/bin/cmake -E cmake_link_script CMakeFiles/bitcoin-chainstate.dir/link.txt --verbose=1\r\n/usr/bin/clang++ -O2 -g -fstack-protector-all -fcf-protection=full -fstack-clash-protection -Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now -Wl,-z,separate-code -fPIE -pie \"CMakeFiles/bitcoin-chainstate.dir/bitcoin-chainstate.cpp.o\" -o bitcoin-chainstate  kernel/libbitcoinkernel.a crypto/libbitcoin_crypto.a crypto/libbitcoin_crypto_sse41.a crypto/libbitcoin_crypto_avx2.a crypto/libbitcoin_crypto_x86_shani.a ../libleveldb.a ../libcrc32c.a ../libcrc32c_sse42.a secp256k1/src/libsecp256k1.a  \r\n```\r\n\r\nEvidently cmake is capable of correctly calculating the required libraries within the Bitcoin Core cmake project, but it is not clear to me what the best approach towards solving this for the installed library might be. Cmake seems to be inherently incapable of combining static libraries. A potential solution for this could be adding an `ar` hack that manually \"re-ars\" the archives into a single, static kernel library (though it is not clear how to recursively calculate the required libraries). Another solution could also be shipping all these small, additional libraries in a separate install step.",

      "body": "I see. It does seem like cmake doesn't want to support \"convenience libraries\" (static libraries which are combinations of other static libraries) in the same way that libtool does. Which is kind of understandable because it would complicate dependency tracking and result in multiple libraries with duplicate copies of the same symbols which waste space and might not be safely linkable together.\r\n\r\nMaybe using TARGET_OBJECTS and manually specifying recursive library dependencies would be a workable initial solution, and later could decide if we want to automate this figure out recursive dependencies generically like \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/66575545. I think there is a probably a simpler implementation of the `bundle_static_library` function defined there which could be using `TARGET_OBJECTS`\r\n\r\nAlso again it could be a good idea to abandon combined library approach and just install individual libraries. If the downstream project you are are trying to use the library from is not a cmake project we could generate a pkg-config `.pc` file that just tells it what compiler and linker flags to use so it does not have to be aware of names or structure of our libraries at all and can just apply the flags.",
