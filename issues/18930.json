    "title": "test: Remove sync_blocks global",
    "body": "sync_blocks has been made a member of the test framework in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15773, but the global helper has been left intact for now.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested to move the implementation to the member function as well https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15773#pullrequestreview-224235071\r\n\r\nImplementing the functionality in a single place in the test framework allows the method to take account of contextual information, such as global timeout modifications. Also, having a global that does almost-but-not-quite the same thing is confusing for test writers and reviewers.\r\n\r\nSo the implementation should be moved, along with removing the global helper.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nPython3, basic understanding of the test framework\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it. This will help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed and is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",

Nobody asked me to work on it, I simply signed up. \r\n\r\nThis particular group of issues, *good first issues*, also contains very old entries, because nobody else was working on them. So I am taking all those breadcrumbs and try to solve them. \r\n\r\nBut there are also other PRs of mine which have nothing to do with *good first* issues, so I really don't understand your question. Also, I don't see how I can help by **not reacting** to issues. \r\n\r\nA mediocre coder, like I am, can help best by solving minor, unimportant issues, in my opinion. Or by reviewing other people's PR, that I also do. Or by writing some smaller scripts for automating things, like with Bitcoin Signet.\r\n\r\nSo, all in all, little unimportant things that I do in my ~quarantine~ spare time. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't dare interacting with complex PRs, because such behavior would only cost valuable time of others. \r\n\r\nBut if this is an issue, no problem, there are other open source projects. \r\n\r\nCheers.",

There should be enough issues for everyone :)\r\n\r\nThanks @amitiuttarwar for raising the issue that some upcoming contributors sometimes see an issue they want to work on already be taken. I think this problem can not be prevented in general, there might always be more than one person interested in an issue. So if someone is feeling left out on good first issues, please feel free to reach out to me directly. The email in the git commits, my twitter, or anything else should work as medium of contact, but not in person unless you have a face mask :)\r\n\r\nOthers and I will keep posting issues here, too.",

As an example: I loved how you fixed a bug in one of the fuzzers I added the other day. That's great: given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow :)\r\n\r\nNever hesitate to ping me if I can review or assist in any way, shape or form!\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core is a big family -- and as in every big family we certainly don't agree on everything -- but personally I'm convinced that there are enough issues to keep us all occupied writing and reviewing code to make sure the Bitcoin Core of tomorrow is in even better than the Bitcoin Core we have today! :)",

      "body": "hi @brakmic\n\nI’m really sorry I’ve made you feel unwelcome. That was not at all my intent. I’ve found the bitcoin core project to be a welcoming place, and I strive to further that culture. It makes me sad that my words here have landed in an incendiary way.\n\nOpen source development is hard for a number of reasons. One is that we are all working on partial information. Recently, I had multiple individuals approach me looking for a way to onboard onto the project. My general advice is to them is to 1. familiarize with the tests,  2. start reviewing PRs & 3. look for good first issues. I’ve gotten the feedback that the good first issues are usually taken quickly after being posted, but I only have this perspective because of the direct communication, and don’t expect that others would necessarily know that people are searching.\n\nThe intent of my comment was to share a perspective. Not to impose upon you what you should or shouldn’t do, and definitely not to discourage you. As I originally said, I appreciate your enthusiasm to contribute to the project.\n\n@MarcoFalke thanks for your offer to help anyone interested find work to do. That’s awesome.\n\nTo all the contributors who have worked hard to make this project a welcoming environment, not just here, but in many other places - a heartfelt thank you. I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for all of you.\n\nTo anybody reading this who might be considering working on Bitcoin- I hope it’s very clear that you are welcome here & there are many people interested in supporting your journey.",
