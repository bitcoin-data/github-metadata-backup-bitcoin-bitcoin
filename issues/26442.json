    "title": "Use of undocumented/undefined boost::signals2 behavior in wallet",
    "body": "While working on a minimal rewrite for our remaining usage of `boost::signals2` ([POC branch here](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/tree/replace-boost-signals)), I stumbled upon some undocumented/undefined behavior with our current usage.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the problem, introduced in #17261, is that signals aren't intended to connect to other signals. Currently this is violated in the wallet: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L3518\r\n\r\nSee the boost discussion here: https://groups.google.com/g/boost-list/c/So4i8JXneJ0\r\n\r\nOn my WIP replacement branch I implemented it by chaining the calls as suggested (and as-intended in our code):\r\nhttps://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/blob/replace-boost-signals/src/btcsignals.h#L140 . This makes tests happy, so presumably that's what's going on with boost too, though there are details (like interim disconnections) which could give us trouble in the future.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the fact that this works for now, I don't think that we should be relying on it. I haven't looked into the details, but I'm hoping it could be fixed with some simple stub functions.\r\n\r\nPing @achow101. Any easy/obvious workarounds?",

So the obvious solution here would be to connect to the SPKM signals directly instead of `CWallet`'s, and remove the signals from `CWallet` entirely. This could be done with a helper (perhaps modifying `ConnectScriptPubKeyManNotifiers`?), although perhaps there might be issues with connecting the signal for SPKMs that are created afterwards.",

      "body": "> although perhaps there might be issues with connecting the signal for SPKMs that are created afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe wallet could trigger a signal on every added SPKM. e.g. trigger `NewScriptPubKeyMan(const uint256& id)` so the GUI subscribes to it calling `ConnectScriptPubKeyMan(const uint256& id, callback)`.\r\n\r\nStill, have to say that I'm not so convinced about it. Independently from boost's problem, I think that, layers division wise, the spkm signal should first pass through the wallet, which could perform some operations with it (update/refresh some state/cache), and then the wallet trigger the upper layers signal (or call a function in a signals dispatcher object like we do in the validation area).",
