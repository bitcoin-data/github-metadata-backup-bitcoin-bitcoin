    "title": "meta: Isolated fuzzing of net processing",
    "body": "Efficient isolated fuzzing of our message processing code (net processing) would be very valuable. However, to make that deterministic, fast and fuzzer friendly it appears that extensive refactoring is required. There are three main blockers: module separation (net/net processing/validation split), determinism, performance.\r\n\r\nI am gonna use this issue to track and motivate the work that needs to be done. It would be great if we can achieve the same outcome with less refactoring but I don't see how at the moment. Open to suggestions and feedback.\r\n\r\n### Module separation\r\n\r\nOnce we have a clean separation between our net, net processing and validation modules, we can fuzz/test them in isolation to maximize the bug yield (🐛, 🪲, 🪳). By design, most fuzzing engines are not great at finding bugs when the scope of the targets is too large (e.g. fuzzing net, net processing and validation all at once).\r\n\r\n* net / net processing split (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28252)\r\n  * Move application layer data from net to net processing ([#19398](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19398))\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26621\r\n  * Define a clean interface between net processing <-> net \r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25268\r\n      - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25500\r\n      - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25572\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27257\r\n* net processing / validation split (lots of overlap with kernel)\r\n  * Reduce `cs_main` usage in net processing\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26151\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26140\r\n    - [ ] Kill CNodeState\r\n  * Define a clean interface between net processing <-> validation\r\n\r\n### Determinism\r\n\r\nNon-deterministic fuzz targets are less efficient at finding bugs and debugging non-reproducible bugs is annoying/costly.\r\n\r\n* All required components should be newly setup for each target execution\r\n  * Can be done currently using our testing setup suite but that's waaaay too slow for fuzzing.\r\n* Avoid  `GetRand()` (mock it?)\r\n* Avoid globals (are there any globals left in net processing?)\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nFuzzing is a search, the faster the search - the better.\r\n\r\n* LevelDB (is in memory but still slow?)\r\n  * Probably solved by mocking out validation?\r\n* PeerManager construction is expensive because it requires multi megabyte allocations each time (mostly due to large bloom filters)\r\n* Disk usage\r\n  * Block storage\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125\r\n    - [ ] Create a mock of BlockManager for in memory block storage?\r\n  * BanMan (banlist is written to disk)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n* Decouple net processing from ArgsMan (args setup is slow)\r\n  * Allows to fuzz the peerman options without depending on the global args man \r\n  - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27499\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you think there are PRs that aren't listed here but should be.\r\n",

Or alternatively, we could allow to set the size of these filters when creating a peerman (i think that would be fine for tests).",

Is this intended to be abstracted away from validation/mempool behaviours (ie, stubbing them out)?\r\n\r\nMostly all code in `net_processing.cpp` (and relevant modules like orphanage, tx tracker) but excluding net, validation or mempool logic. Stubbing the latter out gives us control over testing net processing behavior related to these adjacent modules by being able to mock their behavior and state.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that we shouldn't fuzz the other modules, just that it makes more sense to do in isolation for the type of fuzzing we currently utilize. We can also fuzz the integration of them all but snapshot fuzzing is probably much better for that due to quite heavy initial state requirements (I have been working on this as well using https://nyx-fuzz.com/).\r\n\r\n> The possible behaviour of an individual p2p message in isolation? The p2p protocol state machine for a single peer?\r\n\r\nYes and yes, each would be its own target. Another example would be the processing of a sequence of messages e.g. a target per protocol flow we are interested in testing: version handshake, compact block relay, tx relay, etc. All of this can happen for a single peer or multiple.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

After #27675 there's only a single trivial `LOCK(m_mempool.cs)` left in net_proc, so I think it would just be a bunch of search-and-replaces to abstract those out? That seems like it would be handy for stubbing, but also make it a lot clearer what parts of validation/mempool are actually needed by net_processing, which might help with reducing `cs_main` or otherwise cleaning up validation/mempool?",

Alternatively we could work on making the actual mempool/chainman interfaces mockable/more abstract but that might be more work and would also interfere with kernel.\r\n\r\nFor the  `PeerManChainPoolInterface` approach, I would probably go with a separate interface for mempool and chainman but that's just a minor detail. I think abstracting out chainman would be most of the work but also the biggest gain for fuzzing since that would avoid chainman setup/teardown.\r\n\r\nI can code up a parent PR/branch (similar to #28252) for this (I already had some of this done while working on a block download module).",
