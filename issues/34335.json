    "title": "Request: Support for Vietnamese localization of Bitcoin Core source/documents",
    "body": "Hi Bitcoin Core community 👋\n\nI’m a developer and member of the Vietnamese Bitcoin community. We greatly appreciate all the work done by the contributors of Bitcoin Core and the open-source ecosystem.\n\nWe would like to help make Bitcoin more accessible to Vietnamese speakers by providing Vietnamese translations of:\n\nUser-facing strings in the Bitcoin Core UI (translation of menu items, labels, messages, etc.)\n\nEnd-user documentation (README, Bitcoin.org docs, guides)\n\nDeveloper documentation (API docs, examples)\n\nVietnamese is spoken by over 95 million people, and having localized docs and UI would make Bitcoin more useful and easier to adopt for Vietnamese developers and users.\n\nBefore starting work, we would like to ask for guidance and community support:\n\nIs there an existing localization process for Bitcoin Core that we should follow?\n\nShould translations be maintained in a specific format/tool (e.g., gettext .po, Crowdin, Weblate, etc.)?\n\nAre there maintainers willing to review and merge Vietnamese translations?\n\nDo you recommend guidelines for terminology (e.g., how to translate technical terms like UTXO, fee bumping, mempool, PSBT)?\n\nWe are happy to start a working group and coordinate the translation effort. Any pointers, best practices, or existing localization infrastructure would be very helpful.\n\nThanks so much for your time and for all the contributions to Bitcoin! ❤️\n\nBest,\n\nLong Ngo",
