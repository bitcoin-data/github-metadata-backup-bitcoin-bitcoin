    "title": "Block template memory management (for IPC clients)",
    "body": "## Background\n\nEach time we send an IPC client a new `BlockTemplate`, via `createNewBlock` or `waitNext` on the Mining interface, libmultiprocess ensures that we hold on to its encapsulated `CBlockTemplate`. It's just as if our own code has a shared pointer to it.\n\nWe let go of it when either the client calls the `destroy` method or they disconnect (cc @ryanofsky ??).\n\nThe `CBlockTemplate` in turn contains a `CBlock` which contains pointers to individual transactions. Those transactions were in the mempool at the time the template was created, so initially there's barely any memory overhead. But as time goes by the mempool changes and the template keeps holding on to them.\n\nThis is an important behavior, because at any time the client may call `submitSolution()`. That method only takes the `nVersion`, `nTime`, `nonce` and a coinbase transaction as arguments, so it's up to us to reconstruct the block and broadcast it to our peers.\n\nAdditionally, in scenarios where a miner proposes blocks to the pool, such as pool may request some or all of the transactions for inspection.\n\nAt some point however we need to let go of `CBlockTemplate` references, because otherwise the node runs out of memory.\n\nI think we should leave it up to the client to decide which templates they want us to hold on to. That's because there isn't an obvious best way to do this. For example, we might be sending the client many new templates that build on the same prevhash but have more fees. They may decide to rate limit how many to forward downstream to the miner. Or a miner proxy might do such rate limiting. Mining equipment also needs some time to switch work, so it might send us a solution to a slightly older template.\n\nIn sv2-tp so far I implemented a fairly simple heuristic: 10 seconds after the tip changes, wipe all templates that refer to the previous tip. Additionally it limits the frequency of new templates to once every `-sv2interval` seconds (default 30), though I'm considering dropping that rate limiting in https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-tp/issues/60.\n\nThe work-in-progress SRI implementation in https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-apps/pull/59 currently wipes templates as soon as the tip updates and has no rate limiting other than by fee delta.\n\n## Memory management implementation\n\nThere are probably different ways we can go about memory management here.\n\nThe most straightforward approach is probably to track the additional memory footprint and bound it to `-maxtemplatepoolsize`. If we default that to 50MB it should be plenty for the block template manager proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33758, when it's not used for mining.\n\nThe node could refuse to make new templates when it gets to 80% full and automatically drop the oldest template if it crosses 100%. \n\n## Memory management interface\n\n`createNewBlock` and `waitNext` could throw an exception or return null if the template memory is full. Both are a bit tricky to handle, so maybe they need an additional response status argument to communicate the situation.\n\nWe could also add an additional method to obtain how much memory is used and available. That would allow the Template Provider to pre-empt situations where we refuse to provide it new templates, and worse, where we start dropping them unilaterally.",

      "body": "> [@ryanofsky](https://github.com/ryanofsky) how would the node go about tracking the memory footprint of clients? \n\nThe way I imagined this working is that `MinerImpl` class would have an `size_t m_block_templates_size` member, which the `BlockTemplateImpl` constructor would increment and the destructor would decrement. Then `createNewBlock` and `waitNext` calls could check this and throw an overloaded exception before they do anything if the the size exceeds some cap.\n\nBut I guess a problem with this approach is it does not take into account the fact that transaction references are shared pointers and multiple blocks might not take up very much space if they have a lot of transactions in common. It would be nice if we could ignore this problem and just treat all transactions as unique, but if not, the basic approach here would still be valid. We would just need to replace `size_t` with a more complicated data structure that's aware of transaction counts (like `map<CTransaction*, long>`) and update this in the `BlockTemplateImpl` constructor and destructor.\n\n> Does libmultiprocess track which templates the client still references and is that something we can access?\n\nI believe cap'nproto has a list of objects but don't think it exposes a way to iterate over them. If we do need a list like this, for example to implement your \"automatically drop the oldest template\" idea, we could get one by giving `MinerImpl` a `std::set<BlockTemplateImp*> m_templates` member and adding/removing templates from the set in the `BlockTemplateImpl` constructor/destructor.\n\nI'm not sure if we actually need this list though, and actually want to automatically drop older blocks. If we can get away with simply not creating new blocks when a limit has been reached instead of trying to automatically delete existing blocks, that would seem simpler for both the client and the server.\n\n\n",

      "body": "> It would be nice if we could ignore this problem and just treat all transactions as unique\n\nIt might be simplest thing to implement and we can improve it later. But for some rough numbers: 4MB per template, one per second for two hours, would be counted as 28GB, even if the actual footprint is a fraction of that. \n\nMaintaining a `map<CTransactionRef, long>)` the way you suggest makes sense. It's also very easy to calculate the memory footprint of that, and seems more efficient than looping over templates (and tracking which transactions are unique). ",

I think there is actually not much tension between these two things because we could implement everything Matt wants without changing the interface. The IRC discussion just looked to me like a debate about which options should exist in the [`BlockWaitOptions`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6b2d17b13220ea69c33b8cab41fe059ff758874c/src/node/types.h#L69-L88) struct vs `bitcoin.conf`, and how aggressive the `createNewBlock` and `waitNext` methods should be about returning `OVERLOADED` to clients.\n\nI think we all want the default `BlockWaitOptions` to be responsive and provide updates quickly without overloading the node, and we should focus on achieving this before spending much time debating which knobs should exist and where they should live.",
