    "title": "Support JSON-RPC 2.0",
    "body": "Currently Bitcoind supports JSON-RPC 1.0 and couple of 2.0 features \n\nIf you look at existing implementations - 61 of 71 works ONLY with 2.0 version.\nAnd in reality there is no Java library that supports 1.0\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC#Implementations\nMoreover - wiki page looks outdated, I think that all libs except 2-3 support only 2.0 version.\n\nWe need main features from JSON-RPC 2.0 (http://www.simple-is-better.org/rpc/#differences-between-1-0-and-2-0):\n1. Transport independence. Bitcoind should not throw 500 http error on every exception. It's only for crashed code.\nFor example, there is no Java JSON-RPC lib that provide sufficient support for hadling 500 http error. So, if you develop Java service that uses Bitcoind - you are not able to work with custom Bitcoind exceptions. (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/bitcoinrpc.h)\nOtherwise you either have to write from scratch or modify existing library, what generally is not easy. Moreover, nobody except you will support this lib for JSON-RPC 1.0\n2. Reduced fields. Some libraries throw an error if the fields \"error\" and \"result\" are found together - it's true for JSON-RPC 1.0, but wrong for 2.0\n3. named parameters\n\nFull support of 2.0 is preferable.\n\nP.S. In recent days, I'm implementing a Java service that uses Bitcoind - guys, this is hell. The current interface is not suitable for real-world applications that deal with money. I don't understand why version 1.0 instead of 2.0 was choosen...\n",

This introduces compliance issues with more strict clients. There are the major misbehaviors that I found:\r\n- returning non-200 HTTP codes for RPC errors like \"Method not found\" (this is not a server error or an HTTP error)\r\n- returning both `\"error\"` and `\"result\"` fields together in a response object.\r\n- different error-handling behavior for single and batched RPC requests (batches contain errors in the response but single requests will actually throw HTTP errors)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15495 added regression tests after a discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15381 to kinda lock in our RPC behavior to preserve backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12435 was an attempt to allow strict 2.0 compliance behind a flag, but was abandoned. \r\n\r\nThe approach in this PR is not strict and preserves backwards compatibility in a familiar bitcoin-y way: all old behavior is preserved, but new rules are applied to clients that opt in. One of the rules in the [JSON RPC 2.0 spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#request_object) is that the kv pair `\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\"` must be present in the request. Well, let's just use that to trigger strict 2.0 behavior! When that kv pair is included in a request object, the [response will adhere to strict JSON-RPC 2.0 rules](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object), essentially:\r\n\r\n- always return HTTP 200 \"OK\" unless there really is a server error or malformed request\r\n- either return `\"error\"` OR `\"result\"` but never both\r\n- same behavior for single and batch requests\r\n\r\nIf this is merged next steps can be:\r\n\r\n- Refactor bitcoin-cli to always use strict 2.0\r\n- Refactor the python test framework to always use strict 2.0 for everything\r\n- Begin deprecation process for 1.0/1.1 behavior (?)\r\n\r\nIf we can one day remove the old 1.0/1.1 behavior we can clean up the rpc code quite a bit.",

(Example: restrict `getpeerinfo` and see that Payjoin stops working.) I didn't try this with newest Core, but I hit it with [btc-rpc-proxy](https://github.com/Kixunil/btc-rpc-proxy), which returns HTTP errors for authentication just like what `bitcoind` does according to the code.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nNot relevant.\r\n\r\n**Discussion**\r\n\r\nI'm opening this issue in order to decide on proper handling of RPC errors. I see these possible approaches:\r\n\r\n* `RPC_METHOD_NOT_FOUND` becomes public, [the comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/99813a9745fe10a58bedd7a4cb721faf14f907a4/src/rpc/protocol.h#L29) is removed and the rest of the code stays the same, the behavior doesn't change.\r\n* [`JSONErrorReply`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/99813a9745fe10a58bedd7a4cb721faf14f907a4/src/rpc/protocol.h#L29) function is modified to return HTTP errors for batched calls too.\r\n* New public error codes are defined and used for every method independently, the mapping to HTTP codes is removed (at least for batched calls)\r\n\r\nI personally like the last one because it allows efficient inspection of node capabilities, but I'm worried that it might break some clients. I'd love to hear arguments from people who are more experienced in this area.",
