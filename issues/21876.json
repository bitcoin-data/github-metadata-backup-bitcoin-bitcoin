      "body": "> What would this feature be used for? Why would you want to broadcast a transaction to one specific peer and not other peers?\r\n\r\nPrivacy: Ensure that your transactions cannot be linked to your IP address\r\nFreedom: Users will have more control over the peers selected for broadcasting a transaction.\r\n\r\nThere can be different setups a user or any open source wallet using Bitcoin Core in the backend might want to try for broadcasting transactions. \r\n\r\nTwo examples:\r\n\r\n1. User checks outbound connections and randomly select 1-2 peers for each transaction while broadcasting. If the node has 8 outbound connections, 2 out of 8 are spy nodes, they wont know about each transaction broadcasted.\r\n2. User wants to create a setup similar to [Dandelion](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/building-on-bitcoin/2018/dandelion/) with short stem and guard node like Tor. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/117567673-bcb0e200-b0da-11eb-9a71-0a32ca8b179b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n`A`: Node used by Alice regularly for broadcasting transactions\r\n`B`: Another node managed by Alice\r\n`C`: Random node in Bitcoin peer to peer network\r\n\r\n_Assume we also have two options in `bitcoin.conf`. One can be used to save addresses for nodes that will used for broadcasting transactions, so we don't mention it for every transaction. Other option to randomly select one peer from outbound connections for broadcasting._ \r\n\r\nSetup 1: Node `A` broadcasts all transactions to only `B`. Node `B` randomly selects one peer from outbound connections to relay this transaction. Node `C` is using default options to it relays all transactions to all the peers. \r\n\r\nSetup 2: Node `A` broadcasts most of the transactions to `B`. Node `B` works same as `C` in this case and relays all transactions to all peers. \r\n\r\n> Do you know what is used for in libbtc?\r\n\r\nNot sure.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOther alternatives for privacy are Tor and i2p. Only 20% nodes use Tor according to [Bitnodes](https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/?days=365) and i2p support is recently merged. I don't expect 100% usage of Tor/i2p ever and few ipv4/ipv6 nodes should exist for reasons mentioned in [docs/tor.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6bf33db373588582c85ee537cd5e9302c593cb02/doc/tor.md#4-privacy-recommendations). Not sure [Dandelion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20203) will be implemented in Bitcoin so adding such option can only help in improving privacy for users or making things difficult for spy nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "It would be nice if there was a way to tell core to only broadcast transactions over Tor, but use clearnet for everything else.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell the only way to guarantee transaction broadcast over Tor is to use onlynet=onion, which means that all network traffic goes over Tor. The problem is that this introduces latency for blocks/confirmations and transactions. Some users might only want to use Tor to try to protect \"first broadcast\" transaction origin analysis which can be a problem with sybil attacking clearnet nodes. This can still be a problem on Tor as well, but can be more difficult to pull off.\r\n\r\nSome bitcoin software such as wasabi and joinmarket already implement this by establishing a new Tor circuit, broadcasting the transaction, and then disconnecting. Perhaps bitcoin could do this as well?\r\n\r\nSome things that were brought up when I mentioned this on IRC by @naumenkogs, @luke-jr  and others:\r\n\r\nFor the resistance to first-broadcast analysis to be effective, the node should treat the transaction as if it wasn't theirs to begin with. I'm not familiar with the network code, so I'm not sure if anything would have to change relay policy-wise.\r\n\r\nWould be happy to hear other thoughts on what would be required to implement this, or if there's something I'm missing, as it's something I would be interested in implementing if there are enough concept acks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR rationale:\r\n\r\n- A nodes wants to recieve blocks/confirmations/transactions as soon as possible with the lowest latency\r\n\r\n- A node wants increased broadcast privacy without paying the full cost of onlynet=tor latency\r\n",

So using a specific trusted peer to rebroadcast seems reasonable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, user might have a Transport v2 connection and it's biggest worry is his ISP spying on him. In this case the user might want to use (one of) his v2 connected peers for (re)broadcasting the tx.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nnew RPC `sendrawtransactiontopeer`, where the raw tx and peer are specified\r\n(somewhat similar to `sendmsgtopeer`)\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n- [have an argument in `sendrawtransaction` to specify a peer](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876#issue-879140859)\r\n- [ _use -connect=<ip> to connect only to the specified node(s)._](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876#issuecomment-1212166950) (for this, the user would need to restart and disconnect all other peers every time he wants to do it)\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876, similar request but suggesting to add an argument in `sendrawtransaction` to mention the peer\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509, useful but `sendrawtransactiontopeer` would still be a good addition imo\r\n\r\n**Could this be used by malicious parties (who want to get a better view of the network etc)?** \r\nMaybe, but they might already be doing that with a modified client.\r\n\r\nIn contrary, `sendrawtransactiontopeer` might make transaction broadcast/relay analysis harder.",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* Independent improvement (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29419):\r\n  * `log: deduplicate category names and improve logging.cpp`\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",
