      "body": "Doing some testing on OpenBSD 9.4, using `./configure --disable-wallet --no-gui CC=cc CXX=c++`.\r\n\r\nautomake `1.14.1p0` and `1.15.1` both work, this problem only happens with `1.16.1`.\r\n\r\nLooking at the automake 1.16 [release notes](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2018-02/msg00008.html):\r\n```\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n\r\n  - Automatic dependency tracking has been fixed to work also when the\r\n    'subdir-object' option is used and some 'foo_SOURCES' definition\r\n    contains unexpanded references to make variables, as in, e.g.:\r\n\r\n        a_src = sources/libs/aaa\r\n        b_src = sources/bbb\r\n        foo_SOURCES = $(a_src)/bar.c $(b_src)/baz.c\r\n\r\n    With such a setup, the created makefile fragment containing dependency\r\n    tracking information will be correctly placed under the directories\r\n    named 'sources/libs/aaa/.deps' and 'sources/bbb/.deps', rather than\r\n    mistakenly under directories named (literally!) '$(src_a)/.deps' and\r\n    '$(src_b)/.deps' (this was the first part of automake bug#13928).\r\n\r\n    Notice that in order to fix this bug we had to slightly change the\r\n    semantics of how config.status bootstraps the makefile fragments\r\n    required for the dependency tracking to work: rather than attempting\r\n    to parse the Makefiles via grep and sed trickeries only, we actually\r\n    invoke 'make' on a slightly preprocessed version of those Makefiles,\r\n    using a private target that is only meant to bootstrap the required\r\n    makefile fragments.\r\n\r\n  - The 'subdir-object' option no longer causes object files corresponding\r\n    to source files specified with an explicit '$(srcdir)' component to be\r\n    placed in the source tree rather than in the build tree.\r\n\r\n    For example, if Makefile.am contains:\r\n\r\n        AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = subdir-objects\r\n        foo_SOURCES = $(srcdir)/foo.c $(srcdir)/s/bar.c $(top_srcdir)/baz.c\r\n\r\n    then \"make all\" will create 'foo.o' and 's/bar.o' in $(builddir) rather\r\n    than in $(srcdir), and will create 'baz.o' in $(top_builddir) rather\r\n    than in $(top_srcdir).\r\n\r\n    This was the second part of automake bug#13928.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I'd assume however this bug has been fixed has broken some behaviour we've been relying on/working around?",
