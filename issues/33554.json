      "body": "(So far I'm not able to reproduce a crash with v30.0rc3, but that might just be because I was testing with regtest.)\n\nThe assert you see happening on [line 289](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/blob/13424cf2ecc1e5eadc85556cf1f4c65e915f702a/include/mp/proxy-io.h#L289) just happens when the IPC client asks the server to execute multiple IPC calls simultaneously on the same thread. The IPC server does not expect this and currently aborts when it happens.\n\nIt is possible for the server to execute multiple IPC calls simultaneously, but the client needs to create more than one thread thread with [ThreadMap.makeThread](https://github.com/plebhash/sv2-bitcoin-core/blob/93fd9dcf1baf8d8897bcd34e4f4cb86d0616cc19/src/lib.rs#L136-L140) and [assign](https://github.com/plebhash/sv2-bitcoin-core/blob/93fd9dcf1baf8d8897bcd34e4f4cb86d0616cc19/src/lib.rs#L283) different threads to the IPC calls that are supposed to execute simultaneously.\n\nThe server is pretty fragile and unhelpful for failing this way, but a recently merged PR https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/214 should make the situation better by having the server return with a \"thread busy\" error instead of aborting when this happens.\n\n",

Probably there is something the rust code could be doing differently to prevent the crash, but that wouldn't mean it is doing anything wrong, since the node should be able to avoid crashing on unclean shutdowns. Will look into this more and try to suggest changes and fix.",

      "body": "Thanks @plebhash. The stack trace from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33554#issuecomment-3378637474 shows the problem pretty clearly, and I created an issue to track it: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/226.\n\nIt looks to me like there's not way great way for the rust client to avoid this problem, and this is something `bitcoin-node` should be changed to fix by (1) fixing the abort described in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/226 and (2) improving the mining interface so there is a way to interrupt `waitNext` calls.\n\nI think currently the only reliable way to avoid triggering the abort is to avoid disconnecting until `waitNext` returns.\n\nBut this might be undesirable because there isn't currently a way to interrupt the waitNext call and have it return early. It would be good if `bitcoin-node` would address this by adding a new [`BlockTemplate`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ec5841888de7fa2b194b6cd06641b0efbab57cd4/src/ipc/capnp/mining.capnp#L24) `interruptWait` method, or just have `BlockTemplate` destructor interrupt the wait. The client should have some clean way of interrupting the `waitNext` call if it no longer needs a new block so mining interface clients can shut down quickly and cleanly.\n\n",

      "body": "I have a question related to the approach I started taking with the insights coming from the crashes reported here.\n\nfollowing your advice, I'm no longer using one single server thread for everything... now there's one \"static\" server thread that's responsible for all non-blocking calls (e.g.: fetching some template data or submitting solution to some template)\n\nand for `waitNext`, there's dedicated server thread(s)\n\nthe thing is, I still need to cater for incoming Sv2 `CoinbaseOutputConstraints` messages, and whenever that arrives, I need to make sure the `BlockTemplate` (or `TemplateIpcClient` as I'm aliasing on the rust code) that's used to kickstart the next `waitNext` loops has the correct `block_reserved_weight` and `max_additional_sigops` as defined on the Sv2 message.\n\nand since I cannot interfere with server thread dedicated to the ongoing `waitNext` (because it would lead to crashes), I'm being forced to instantiate yet another server thread, just so I can instantiate the new `BlockTemplate` with the new coinbase constraints and kickstart the new `waitNext` loop\n\nso my question is: by doing this, am I risking unbounded resource consumption on `bitcoin-node`? because basically I'm not taking any explicit steps to kill the server thread that was dedicated for `waitNext` loops under the previous coinbase constraints... the reference to `ThreadIpcClient` is simply dropped from memory, and that's it.\n\nanyways, once the changes mentioned on the comment above take place, this should no longer be a relevant issue, because as soon as `CoinbaseOutputConstraints` arrived, I'd be able to kill the current `waitNext` call and simply use the same server thread for the new one, so the rust client would always be using only two server threads without any need for creating more server threads every time we had new coinbase constraints\n\nbut I felt I should ask anyways, because it seems like an important concept that's still foggy on my mental model for IPC \n\n",

      "body": "These are good questions. I opened #33575 to figure out how to cancel waitNext calls, and I think it should not be hard to provide that.\n\nMore broadly, I think I'd try just having a c++ \"waiter\" thread dedicated to running `waitNext` calls, and a c++ \"worker\" thread to run all other IPC operations besides `waitNext`. The \"waiter\" thread should be mostly blocked monitoring mempool and network, and the \"worker\" thread should be available to do anything else you might need like fetching and submitting block data.\n\nWith current v30 code, there is no mechanism to cancel waitNext calls, so I think simplest approach would be to create a new c++ thread for each waitNext call, effectively having multiple \"waiter\" threads and one \"worker\" thread. This will use more resources, but I would not expect it to take a lot more, because presumably `block_reserved_weight` and `max_additional_sigops` option values should not change very frequently, and new blocks being connected should provide an upper limit on how long waitNext calls stick around.",

The original issue where then node crashes when a client requests to multiple IPC calls to execute simultaneously on the same worker thread should be fixed by https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/214 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33519 which replaces the crashes with \"thread busy\" errors.\n\nThe crash reported later where killing the rust code in the middle of a waitNext call causes the node to crash during shutdown (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33554#issuecomment-3378693317) isn't fixed yet but I created a separate issue to track it https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/226. Also the new `interruptWait` method in #33676 should make the problem less likely to happen if the rust client uses it.\n\nWill close this since remaining issue is tracked in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/226\n",
