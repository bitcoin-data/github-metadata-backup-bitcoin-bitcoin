    "body": "<!-- This issue tracker is only for technical issues related to Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nGeneral bitcoin questions and/or support requests are best directed to the Bitcoin StackExchange at https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com.\r\n\r\nFor reporting security issues, please read instructions at https://bitcoincore.org/en/contact/.\r\n\r\nIf the node is \"stuck\" during sync or giving \"block checksum mismatch\" errors, please ensure your hardware is stable by running memtest and observe CPU temperature with a load-test tool such as linpack before creating an issue! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the issue -->\r\n\r\nIn my quest to finally fix #25094, I figured I need to bind the onion listen port explicitly to the external interface (`bitcoind`), not to \"all interfaces\" (`[::]`). So I'm using the argument\r\n\r\n```\r\n-bind=bitcoind:${BITCOIND_TOR_PORT}=onion\r\n```\r\n\r\n`/etc/hostname` is set to `bitcoind` and the `hostname` command yields the expected result. Also, both `nslookup` and `ping` can resolve the hostname to the external IP.\r\n\r\nNote: I cannot use the numerical IP, because Docker assigns IP addresses dynamically on each invocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI'd expect bitcoind to also resolve the hostname to my external IP, just like ping and nslookup do.\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->\r\n\r\nIn short, it dies.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoind_1          | Error: Cannot resolve -bind address: 'bitcoind:8334=onion'\r\nbitcoind_1          | Shutdown: In progress...\r\nbitcoind_1          | Error: Cannot resolve -bind address: 'bitcoind:8334=onion'\r\nbitcoind_1          | Shutdown: done\r\n```\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nbitcoind 24.0rc4 (self built), Docker+Compose from Ubuntu 22.04.1.\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue? What is your operating system and its version?

      "body": "I see these options for configuring the bind port of a Tor hidden service:\r\n\r\n1. Use wildcard addresses (`0.0.0.0` and/or `[::]`). This binds correctly, but it seems bitcoind is picking one of them and using that (via Tor control port) for configuration of the target address of the hidden service. This fails, because the wildcard address has a different meaning to the Tor container. To fix this issue, bitcoind could offer a separate configuration option for the target address (which would support hostnames, see below). This issue is tracked in #25094.\r\n2. Use hostnames to bind to a specific external interface, which can be reached via that name or resolved IP from the Tor container. As stated above, bitcoind currently does not support this. I don't get the security argument – it's up to the user to trust their name resolution and configure bitcoind either by hostname or IP as desired.\r\n3. Use fixed numerical IP, which can be reached from the Tor container. However, IPs are typically assigned dynamically (e.g. by Docker). This makes configuration overly complicated, as your workaround clearly shows. For example, Docker containers use arbitrary values in `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/hostname` by default, so your workaround wouldn't work out of the box. I'd rather use `nslookup`, if I were to go that route.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, currently none of the options work with the configuration of a Tor hidden service, managed by bitcoind via control port. Currently I can only revert back to the old method of managing the hidden service in the Tor container.",

It is a feature request to change the behavior.\r\n2. If `bitcoind` listens on `0.0.0.0` or `::` for incoming tor connections, then it would tell the tor daemon to connect to that address. This is a bug that could be resolved by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22729#issuecomment-927802257.\r\n\r\nIt has been like this since the start and is not a regression from a previous version. There is no patch for either one at the moment.",
