    "body": "**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAll C++ code to be 100% using legal C++ and not UB which can lead to subtle bugs if not now, then perhaps in the future.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nUse of undefined behavior in at least two places:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/42fe6aad326f62c7e6ea12ee873149257f67ce5d/src/net_processing.cpp#L227\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/42fe6aad326f62c7e6ea12ee873149257f67ce5d/src/miner.h#L67\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nPlease see this part of the C++ specification: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_comparison\r\n\r\nIn particular I will quote the relevant section here:\r\n\r\n> If two pointers are not specified to compare greater or compare equal, the result of the comparison is unspecified. The result may be nondeterministic, and need not be consistent even for multiple evaluations of the same expression with the same operands in the same execution of the program:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nint x, y;\r\n \r\nbool f(int* p, int* q) { return p < q; }\r\n \r\nassert(f(&x, &y) == f(&x, &y)); // may fire in a conforming implementation\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in the above-linked section (which I admit is difficult to decipher) -- pointers are only specified to have a legal `<` or `>` comparison operations if the objects they point to either belong to the same array, or if the objects they point to live basically as members in the same object (i.e. as class members).  *This is unlike in C*.  The code will compile.. it will run -- but like the above section states, and the above sample program illustrates --  the results may be non-deterministic!\r\n\r\nIn practice it appears the code works in bitcoin for all known compilers and platforms -- but is not guaranteed to do so forever and may lead to subtle bugs in the future as compilers evolve or as `libstdc++` evolves.\r\n",

This means the compiler can choose whatever it likes about the order of the two objects, but it's one or the other, and cannot do anything else.\n\nHowever, there is no guaranteed total ordering on unrelated pointers. This means that while not UB, the code in IteratorComparator may in theory not do what it's intended to do. E.g. a<b and b<a might both be simultaneously true.\n\nI'm not sure if this is what @practicalswift was alluding to, but std::less (and friends) when specialized to any given pointer type *is* a well defined total ordering, even when < etc are not.\n\nSo it seems that to be fully compliant, it is sufficient to replace < with std::less in these sorts of operations.",

In theory `std::less` is supposed to be a demarcation point where the compiler's optimizer \"lays off\" with the assumptions -- there are known bugs in GCC for example (many gcc stdlibcc++'s just default to `<` anyway without any magic given to the optimizer).  The problem is not all compilers do the right thing with `std::less`.. it's not easy.  Here is a relevant blog post about this from 2016 that is quite informative: https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2019/01/20/std-less-nightmare/\r\n\r\nBut yes.. it does appear that `std::less` is more.. as @practicalswift originally asserted.

You guys have a lot of influence on what happens in to the Bitcoins* (what BTC people refer to as altcoins such as Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Gold, etc) -- so Core software being top notch impacts us all.\r\n\r\n> May I ask how you found this case? Static analysis?\r\n\r\nHa -- strangely the free static analyzers didn't catch this.  I do have a PVS Studio license -- I should try that and see if it catches it.  No.. I used \"Eyeball analysis\".  I'm maintaining a downstream version of your code -- I work for the Bitcoin Cash Node project.  So -- we have a lot of similarities in terms of large parts of the system.  I initially found this in our software then went to the source (you guys) to discuss it.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for the delineation between UB vs. unspecified -- I'll leave it up to you.  I am not exactly sure either here without reading the \"standardese\" more carefully.  If you like I can modify the title of this issue or you can as well without objection.\r\n",
