However the pattern of \"remember a socket by its file descriptor number and use it later, concurrently with other threads that might close it\" better be avoided. That pattern could lead to closing or writing to the wrong socket which would be more severe.\r\n",

      "body": "This is surprisingly difficult to fix (without doing huge amount of changes). I see two ways to address it:\r\n\r\n1. Hold the socket mutex while `poll()`ing, so that other threads that want to close the socket would have to wait for the `poll()` to finish. Not acceptable IMO.\r\n2. Lazy close with reference counting. Increment the reference count of the socket during `poll()`. Whenever a thread wants to close the socket (disconnect a peer) it should disable the socket for send/recv (e.g. `shutdown(2)`) but not `close(2)` it if reference count is >0 and somebody else should close all disabled sockets with reference count of 0.",

The copy will automatically keep the ref count >0 during `poll()`.\r\n\r\nI will consider this more carefully.",
