    "title": "Awesome multisig PR labyrinth guide",
    "body": "@ryanofsky recently suggested that I should write an overview of how the various pull requests spread over different repositories relate to some bigger picture view.\r\n\r\nSee the [multisig tutorial](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multisig-tutorial.md) for how things currently work.\r\n\r\nI typically have the following future multisig wallet in mind to guide my thinking:\r\n1. a computer running Bitcoin Core holding one master key (key 1)\r\n2. one or more hardware wallets with additional keys, via HWI (keys 2 ... n)\r\n3. taproot keypath using n-of-n MuSig2\r\n4. a fallback with fewer keys after some time elapsed\r\n5. a GUI wizard to set this up (simple Python command line tool until then)\r\n\r\nThe descriptors for this could be hand crafted, but it would be nice to have:\r\n6. Miniscript compiler that can generate this\r\n\r\n**What's Missing?**\r\n\r\n- Taproot support for external signers:\r\n  - [x] #22558 (PSBT fields)\r\n  - [x] #23578 (External signer support)\r\n- [x] Timelock support for descriptors: this will be added along with full [MiniScript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) support in #24148 & #24149 (@darosior).\r\n- [ ] Ability to handle descriptors for which we have 1-of-N keys. Descriptor wallets currently expect the wallet to be either watch-only and have no keys, or to have all the keys.\r\n  - [ ] #25907 makes it possible to create a wallet _with_ a seed, but without any descriptors.\r\n  - [ ] The user would grab an xpub from it (#22341 ) to construct a multisig descriptor and then import that.\r\n  - [ ] PR's to move in the right direction: #23417 and #23544 (very draft) \r\n- [ ] MuSig2 setup and signing support, which requires:\r\n  - [ ] a BIP to specify new PSBT fields\r\n  - [ ] Bitcoin Core changes; no PR yet afaik, see #23326\r\n  - [ ] At least one other (hardware) wallet to support it\r\n      * I'll try to add it to [nthKey](https://github.com/Sjors/nthkey-ios/issues/74) as soon as libwally supports it, see https://github.com/ElementsProject/libwally-core/issues/300)\r\n      * I'm not aware of any hardware wallet working on this yet\r\n      * testing with two Bitcoin Core nodes is good start\r\n  - [ ] HWI changes: additional commands for:\r\n     - [ ] initial setup\r\n     - [ ] signing (although perhaps calling `signtx` multiple times with the right PSBT will \"just work\")\r\n     * doesn't have to be HWI of course, we would just add support new commands in the [external signer command interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md) \r\n- [ ] a simple Python setup wizard\r\n   * right now [Specter Desktop](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop) is by far the easiest way to setup a multisig wallet. But it's a huge dependency (including a bunch of NPM packages for their web interface). A simple Python script in contrib/ could call HWI to get a list of signers, ask what threshold to use, call `createwallet` to generate a blank wallet, fetch an xpub from it, and then call `importdescriptors`.\r\n   * the script could use [BIP 129 / BSMS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki) (perhaps initially without encryption)\r\n   * Specter doesn't set the external_signer wallet flag, so I have a trivial PR to do that manually: #21928 \r\n- [ ] a GUI setup wizard: once we have an established work flow, we would implement that in the GUI\r\n\r\n**Misc**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a PR that improves address display handling on the device: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24313\r\n\r\nEven better would be if we had a feature to ask the wallet for a signature to prove it has the private key (without passing that information to the outside world of course, see #24186). This requires BIP-322 support on our end (#24058), at least one hardware wallet to support it, and a new HWI `signmessage` command. Perhaps this can later be expanded to allow your device to prove that it (still) has the keys it needs as a co-signer.\r\n\r\nMiniscript compilers currently doesn't support Taproot (e.g. to find the optimal tree structure), but I'm assuming you can still hand craft a leaf containing MiniScript.

Revisiting this I think could be good.  I typically build with `./configure --disable-external-signer`\r\n\r\nThat being said, my main goal is setting up (offline) multisig with Bitcoin Core, and I think it is many other people's goals to set up a wallet as you described in the OP - so thank you for setting up this umbrella issue Sjors! We are getting closer and closer to the final goal!\r\n\r\nI think some other PRs that could be good to add to the above tasklist would be:\r\n\r\nFor Taproot support for external signers: (Besides the already linked #22558 in the OP):\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23578\r\nThere's also an issue created in HWI repo to track Taproot support:\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/501\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Miniscript PRs:\r\n- [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24860\r\n- [x] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/86\r\n- [x] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/89\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25540\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/87\r\n\r\nDescriptors\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22838\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24361\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/92\r\n\r\nThe GUI probably should be built with the new QML based fork? (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml) @jarolrod @hebasto @Bosch-0\r\n\r\nGUI:\r\n- [ ] ~https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/9913~ https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/670\r\nPossibly out of scope (but nice to have):\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/537\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/562\r\n\r\nBIPs to be supported:\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki\r\nBIP 87 Is fulfilled by #23544\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki\r\n\r\nI had set a $1,500 bounty for a GUI in Bitcoin Core that allows for the setting up of an (offline) multisignature wallet (here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21071).  Since then, there's been further work and standardization on this project.  I am raising this bounty to $10,000, to be paid out in bitcoin.  Payments will be made in part as individual tasklists are completed; to be divided up to developers who worked on the code and helped review it; at my discretion. This bounty update overrules and succeeds completely the original $1,500 bounty.\r\n\r\n[Bounty_Signed.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/8506928/Bounty_Signed.txt)\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\nAddition:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The `GetExternalSigner` changes that will be needed as discussed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25235#pullrequestreview-989017687)\r\n\r\nAlso, ultimately:\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/pull/138\r\n\r\nSo that threshold spends can be implemented privately\r\n\r\nEdit: Damn formatting\r\n",

Would be great for the GUI component of this effort was put towards the new QML framework. Imo putting a feature freeze on the widgets GUI and slowly moving towards QML as the project develops would prevent a lot of technical debt - something we don't have a lot of room for.\r\n\r\nTagging others on the project for visibility @GBKS @promag @Mogashni. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking ahead as to how an app like this would function, [Nunchuk](https://github.com/nunchuk-io/nunchuk-desktop) is a great example and imo easier to use than Specter. @hugohn \r\n\r\n",
