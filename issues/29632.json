    "title": "Disallow certain message types under BIP324 v2 transport",
    "body": "V2 transport presents a unique opportunity to disallow a couple p2p messages that we can't deprecate under v1 given their usage. Of the top of my head, it seems like the following things could be disallowed:\r\n\r\n* Bloom filters should not be used and are superseded by client side filtering. `filter{add,clear,load}`, `merkleblock` and `mempool` could therefore be disallowed.\r\n* V1 address relay was superseded by V2 address relay (not to be confused with BIP324 v2 transport). `addr` could therefore be disallowed.\r\n* `getblocks` makes very little sense which is why Bitcoin Core no longer sends it. Syncing headers before downloading blocks should always be preferred. `getblocks` could therefore be disallowed.\r\n\r\nThis might be too late to squeeze in and would require BIP changes as well but long term it seems worthwhile considering. If we ever get rid of v1 transport we can delete the entire code for the things mentioned above (and maybe more?)!",

If that were to happen and stay that way mid/long term, I am not sure this is a good idea. Or, on the flipside, if it is a good idea I guess worst case something like BIP324 Proxy becomes infeasible as a quick fix for most projects.\r\n\r\nCC @theStack ",
