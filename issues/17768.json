    "title": "build: various build system improvements",
    "body": "Opening to keep track of some of the things I'm working on at the moment. Anyone who's interested in helping out/wants to comment can do so:\r\n\r\n- [x] Improve link time error checking using `--fatal-warnings`. Add to invocations of `AX_CHECK_LINK_FLAG`. Being done in #17874.\r\n- [x] Add macOS binary checking to `security-check.py`. Check for `PIE`, `NOUNDEFS`. Done in #17787.\r\n- [x] Patch our depends `ld64` to actually insert `BINDATLOAD`. The patch has been done (also Cory). Needs to be properly tested and PR'd. Add `BINDATLOAD` check to `security-check.py` at the same time.\r\n- [x] Add macOS dynamic library checking to `symbol-check.py`. I've got a version of this [here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/blob/master/macos_dylib_check.py). Done in #17863.\r\n- [ ] Add `macos_min_version` to our ld flags. This isn't so straight forward, our depends ld64 accepts `macosx_min_version` instead of `macos_min_version` and Apple hasn't yet open sourced the version of cctools in which the switchover occurred . Instead of integrating into configure, should be added to depends (this argument actually gets added to the link flags on macOS, with min version set to the OS version). Should be done on top of the ld64 changes in #16392.\r\n\r\nI realise all of the above is macOS specific, so most may not care, however there are some non-macOS build system changes in the pipeline as well:\r\n\r\n- [x] Test using pkg-config for `mingw-w64` Windows cross-compiles. If this works (or can be made to work) correctly, it'll eliminate the non pkg-config paths from the build system. Boost likely to be a sticking point here. Will elimiate the need for PRs like #17740.\r\n- [x] Now that we require `glibc` >= `2.17`, we can look at eliminating some of our `memcpy`/`memmove` back-compat code.\r\n- [x] `librt` back-compat changes done in #17738.\r\n- [x] Qt 5.12.6 in depends. I have a branch with the changes started [here](https://github.com/fanquake/bitcoin/tree/qt_5_12_6). It doesn't yet work for various reasons. One being that you can't actually compile qt 5.12.6 for macOS targeting C++11 (even though it's a configure option), as they have started using C++14 features in the macOS portions of the code, i.e `qcocoabackingstore`. Qt have also removed `xkbcommon` from their third-party tree, which means we'll likely have to integrate it into depends. Windows wants to link against the Remote Desktop API to fix a clipboard copying bug.. . Probably something we can either patch out/turn off.\r\n\r\n",

Also related to #17768.\r\n\r\n#### Issue:\r\n[`LD64`](https://opensource.apple.com/source/ld64/) doesn't set the [MH_BINDATLOAD](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-6153.11.26/EXTERNAL_HEADERS/mach-o/loader.h.auto.html) bit in the header of MACHO executables, when building with `-bind_at_load`. This is in contradiction to the [documentation](https://opensource.apple.com/source/ld64/ld64-450.3/doc/man/man1/ld.1.auto.html):\r\n```bash\r\n-bind_at_load\r\n     Sets a bit in the mach header of the resulting binary which tells dyld to\r\n     bind all symbols when the binary is loaded, rather than lazily.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [`ld` in Apples cctools](https://opensource.apple.com/source/cctools/cctools-927.0.2/ld/layout.c.auto.html) does set the bit, however the [cctools-port](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/cctools-port/) that we use for release builds, bundles `LD64`.\r\n\r\nHowever; even if the linker hasn't set that bit, the dynamic loader ([`dyld`](https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/)) doesn't seem to ever check for it, and from what I understand, it looks at a different part of the header when determining whether to lazily load symbols. \r\n\r\nNote that our release binaries are currently working as expected, and no lazy loading occurs.\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n\r\nUsing a small program, we can observe the behaviour of the dynamic loader.\r\n\r\nConducted using:\r\n```bash\r\nclang++ --version\r\nApple clang version 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.17)\r\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin18.7.0\r\n\r\nld -v\r\n@(#)PROGRAM:ld  PROJECT:ld64-530\r\nBUILD 18:57:17 Dec 13 2019\r\nLTO support using: LLVM version 11.0.0, (clang-1100.0.33.17) (static support for 23, runtime is 23)\r\nTAPI support using: Apple TAPI version 11.0.0 (tapi-1100.0.11)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <iostream>\r\nint main() {\r\n\tstd::cout << \"Hello World!\\n\";\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompile and check the MACHO header:\r\n```bash\r\nclang++ test.cpp -o test\r\notool -vh test\r\n...\r\nMach header\r\n      magic cputype cpusubtype  caps    filetype ncmds sizeofcmds      flags\r\nMH_MAGIC_64  X86_64        ALL LIB64     EXECUTE    16       1424   NOUNDEFS DYLDLINK TWOLEVEL WEAK_DEFINES BINDS_TO_WEAK PIE\r\n\r\n# Run and dump dynamic loader bindings:\r\nDYLD_PRINT_BINDINGS=1 DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE=no_bind.txt ./test\r\nHello World!\r\n```\r\n\r\nRecompile with `-bind_at_load`. Note still no `BINDATLOAD` flag:\r\n```bash\r\nclang++ test.cpp -o test -Wl,-bind_at_load\r\notool -vh test\r\nMach header\r\n      magic cputype cpusubtype  caps    filetype ncmds sizeofcmds      flags\r\nMH_MAGIC_64  X86_64        ALL LIB64     EXECUTE    16       1424   NOUNDEFS DYLDLINK TWOLEVEL WEAK_DEFINES BINDS_TO_WEAK PIE\r\n...\r\nDYLD_PRINT_BINDINGS=1 DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE=bind.txt ./test\r\nHello World!\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we diff the outputs, you can see that `dyld` doesn't perform any lazy bindings when the binary is compiled with `-bind_at_load`, even if the `BINDATLOAD` flag is not set:\r\n```diff\r\n@@ -1,11 +1,27 @@\r\n+dyld: bind: test:0x103EDF030 = libc++.1.dylib:__ZNKSt3__16locale9use_facetERNS0_2idE, *0x103EDF030 = 0x7FFF70C9FA58\r\n+dyld: bind: test:0x103EDF038 = libc++.1.dylib:__ZNKSt3__18ios_base6getlocEv, *0x103EDF038 = 0x7FFF70CA12C2\r\n+dyld: bind: test:0x103EDF068 = libc++.1.dylib:__ZNSt3__113basic_ostreamIcNS_11char_traitsIcEEE6sentryC1ERS3_, *0x103EDF068 = 0x7FFF70CA12B6\r\n+dyld: bind: test:0x103EDF070 = libc++.1.dylib:__ZNSt3__113basic_ostreamIcNS_11char_traitsIcEEE6sentryD1Ev, *0x103EDF070 = 0x7FFF70CA1528\r\n+dyld: bind: test:0x103EDF080 = libc++.1.dylib:__ZNSt3__16localeD1Ev, *0x103EDF080 = 0x7FFF70C9FAE6\r\n<trim>\r\n-dyld: lazy bind: test:0x10D4AC0C8 = libsystem_platform.dylib:_strlen, *0x10D4AC0C8 = 0x7FFF73C5C6E0\r\n-dyld: lazy bind: test:0x10D4AC068 = libc++.1.dylib:__ZNSt3__113basic_ostreamIcNS_11char_traitsIcEEE6sentryC1ERS3_, *0x10D4AC068 = 0x7FFF70CA12B6\r\n-dyld: lazy bind: test:0x10D4AC038 = libc++.1.dylib:__ZNKSt3__18ios_base6getlocEv, *0x10D4AC038 = 0x7FFF70CA12C2\r\n-dyld: lazy bind: test:0x10D4AC030 = libc++.1.dylib:__ZNKSt3__16locale9use_facetERNS0_2idE, *0x10D4AC030 = 0x7FFF70C9FA58\r\n-dyld: lazy bind: test:0x10D4AC080 = libc++.1.dylib:__ZNSt3__16localeD1Ev, *0x10D4AC080 = 0x7FFF70C9FAE6\r\n-dyld: lazy bind: test:0x10D4AC070 = libc++.1.dylib:__ZNSt3__113basic_ostreamIcNS_11char_traitsIcEEE6sentryD1Ev, *0x10D4AC070 = 0x7FFF70CA1528\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: `dyld` also has a `DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH=1` environment variable, that when set, will force any lazy bindings to be non-lazy:\r\n```bash\r\ndyld: forced lazy bind: test:0x10BEC8068 = libc++.1.dylib:__ZNSt3__113basic_ostream\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Thoughts:\r\nAfter looking at the dyld source, I can't find any checks for `MH_BINDATLOAD`. You can see the flags it does check for, such as MH_PIE or MH_BIND_TO_WEAK [here](https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/dyld-732.8/src/ImageLoaderMachO.cpp.auto.html).\r\n\r\nIt seems that the lazy binding of any symbols depends on whether or not [lazy_bind_size](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-6153.11.26/EXTERNAL_HEADERS/mach-o/loader.h.auto.html) from the `LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY` load command is > 0. Which was mentioned in [#17686](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17686#issue-350216254).\r\n\r\n#### Changes:\r\nThis PR is one of [Corys commits](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/7b6ba26178d2754568a1308d3d44e038e9ebf450), that I've rebased and modified to make build. I've also included an addition to the `security-check.py` script to check for the flag.\r\n\r\nHowever, given the above, I'm not entirely sure this patch is the correct approach. If the linker no-longer inserts it, and the dynamic loader doesn't look for it, there might be little benefit to setting it. Or, maybe this is an oversight from Apple and needs some upstream discussion. Looking for some thoughts / Concept ACK/NACK. \r\n\r\nOne alternate approach we could take is to drop the patch and modify security-check.py to look for `lazy_bind_size` == 0 in the `LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY` load command, using `otool -l`.",

It seems to be able to give us library and language features that will simplify future code. ~~For example, for library features, our current `optional.h` is just a wrapper around `boost::optional`, and can be replaced with `std::optional`. Other library features that might be useful include (non-exhaustively): `std::variant`, the file system library, and `std::shared_mutex`.~~ @elichai has kindly provided a table summarizing features useful for Bitcoin Core here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16684#issuecomment-524067463.\r\n\r\nI want to apologize for misspeaking about C++17 _requiring_ GCC8, that is **untrue**, and I believe all of the features we would want will be covered by GCC7, and some by GCC6.\r\n\r\nFor some background on the **cons**: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13356#issuecomment-457870907\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDefault GCC versions major distros (as of Aug 22nd):\r\n\r\n|   | Operating System | release version | GCC version | Notes |\r\n|---|------------------|--------------------------|-------------|------|\r\n| :heavy_check_mark: | Debian           | Buster                   | 8.3         |      |\r\n| :heavy_check_mark: | Ubuntu           | 18.04 LTS                | 7.4         |      |\r\n| :heavy_check_mark: | Fedora           | 30                       | 9.1.1       |      |\r\n| :heavy_check_mark: | RHEL             | 8                        | 8.2         |      |\r\n|  | CentOS           | 7                        | 4.8.5       | CentOS 8 (GCC 8.2) is being released [as we speak](https://wiki.centos.org/About/Building_8#head-516d5e6556bb8523b52fba246953d32831582480) |\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn-depth code examples of\r\n\r\nC++17 features: https://github.com/AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features/blob/master/CPP17.md\r\nC++14 features: https://github.com/AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features/blob/master/CPP14.md\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHere are some compatibility tables from https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support#cpp17\r\n\r\nLibrary features:\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-08-22 at 19 39 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3445290/63544344-91f0b580-c514-11e9-910b-64b82d93ad9d.png)\r\n\r\nLanguage features:\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-08-22 at 19 38 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3445290/63544316-7b4a5e80-c514-11e9-8ce1-4cf873127536.png)\r\n",
