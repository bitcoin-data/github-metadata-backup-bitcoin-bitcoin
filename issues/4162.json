    "body": "### Current Behaviour\n\nIf I use RPC command `sendrawtransaction` and supply an tx hex that is not acceptable (e.g. 1. if a signature is invalid, 2. contains a double spend) bitcoind will reject it, and if the transaction is verified, bitcoind will then propagate the transaction\n### Feature Request\n\nIt would be great if there could be a RPC call that allows `verifyrawtransaction`, which means it will only verify the transaction without propagating.\n",

          "body": "There have been multiple discussions about completing libconsensus in the mailing list but they are hard to find.\nHere's a detailed plan \n\nGoals: \n\n1) Complete libconsensus's C API with the following functions: VerifyScript, VerifyHeader, VerifyTx and VerifyBlock. Possibly also: CheckTransaction/Consensus::CheckTx, Consensus::CheckTxInputs, Consensus::CheckTxInputsScripts (doesn't exist yet in master), CheckBlockHeader, ContextualCheckBlockHeader, CheckBlock and ContextualCheckBlock.\n\n2) Maintain libconsensus as a stateless library that doesn't have its own storage.\n\nRegardless of the concrete final C API, here's some things we do know now and if done in advance, would simplify the task of reviewing concrete C API's proposals:\n- [ ] Separate consensus critical code into different files. Right now, if one wants to propose a concrete C API without moving any code, he needs to include main.cpp (and its abundant dependencies) in the libconsensus build. This goes against goal 2.\n- [ ] Remove depencies that use globals (like Params()/pCurrentParams, util::mapArgs or util::error/util::LogPrintStr/fPrintToConsole_and_friends).\n\nThe most complicated part of proposing a concrete C API is to somehow interface with the equivalent of CBlockIndex and CCoinsViewCache (which depend on storage) in Bitcoin Core:\n- [ ] C-compatible API for CBlockIndex\n- [ ] C-compatible API for CCoinsViewCache\n- [ ] Discuss and accept a complete C API for libconsensus.\n\nIf you think this plan is not detailed enough, please make concrete suggestions or questions: \"this is not well documented enough\" is not very useful as feedback.\n\nProposed API (C++, not the final C API):\n\n```\nbool VerifyScript(const CScript& scriptSig, const CScript& scriptPubKey, unsigned int flags, const BaseSignatureChecker& checker, ScriptError* error = NULL);\n\nbool VerifyTx(const CTransaction& tx, CValidationState &state, const Consensus::Params&, int nBlockHeight, int64_t nBlockTime, const CCoinsViewCache& inputs, int nSpendHeight, bool cacheStore, unsigned int flags);\nbool CheckTx(const CTransaction&, CValidationState&, const Consensus::Params&);\n/**\n * Check whether all inputs of this transaction are valid (no double spends and amounts)\n * This does not modify the UTXO set. This does not check scripts and sigs.\n * Preconditions: tx.IsCoinBase() is false.\n */\nbool CheckTxInputs(const CTransaction& tx, CValidationState& state, const CCoinsViewCache& inputs, int nSpendHeight);\n/**\n * Preconditions: tx.IsCoinBase() is false.\n * Check whether all inputs of this transaction are valid (scripts and sigs)\n * This does not modify the UTXO set. This does not check double spends and amounts.\n * This is the more expensive consensus check for a transaction, do it last.\n */\nbool CheckTxInputsScripts(const CTransaction& tx, CValidationState& state, const CCoinsViewCache& inputs, bool cacheStore, unsigned int flags);\n\n/** Block header validation functions */\n\nbool VerifyBlockHeader(const CBlockHeader&, CValidationState&, const Consensus::Params&, int64_t nTime, CBlockIndexBase*, PrevIndexGetter);\nbool CheckBlockHeader(const CBlockHeader&, CValidationState&, const Consensus::Params&, int64_t nTime, bool fCheckPOW = true);\nbool ContextualCheckBlockHeader(const CBlockHeader&, CValidationState&, const Consensus::Params&, const CBlockIndexBase*, PrevIndexGetter);\n\n/** Block validation functions */\n\nbool VerifyBlock(const CBlock&, CValidationState&, const Consensus::Params&, int64_t nTime, const CBlockIndexBase*, PrevIndexGetter);\nbool CheckBlock(const CBlock& block, CValidationState& state, const Consensus::Params& params, int64_t nTime, bool fCheckPOW = true, bool fCheckMerkleRoot = true);\nbool ContextualCheckBlock(const CBlock&, CValidationState&, const Consensus::Params&, const CBlockIndexBase*, PrevIndexGetter);\n```\n",
