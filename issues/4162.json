    "body": "### Current Behaviour\n\nIf I use RPC command `sendrawtransaction` and supply an tx hex that is not acceptable (e.g. 1. if a signature is invalid, 2. contains a double spend) bitcoind will reject it, and if the transaction is verified, bitcoind will then propagate the transaction\n### Feature Request\n\nIt would be great if there could be a RPC call that allows `verifyrawtransaction`, which means it will only verify the transaction without propagating.\n",
