    "title": "MuSig2 support",
    "body": "ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp#131 adds MuSig2 support to secp256k1-zkp, which is an experimental fork of [secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1). I think it would be useful to have a (series of) draft pr(s) implementing support for this in Bitcoin Core. If only to make it easier to actually test MuSig2.\r\n\r\nMuSig2 paper: \"MuSig2: Simple Two-Round Schnorr Multi-Signatures\" (https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1261)\r\n\r\nTo simplify things a bit, I'm assuming a things for now:\r\n1. The Bitcoin Core wallet coordinates setup and also takes the initiative for proposing a new transaction\r\n2. Two communication rounds are needed for signing ([no storing nonces in advance](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23326#issuecomment-947898104)) \r\n3. ~Only key path spending (for script path spending we probably want miniscript support first anyway)~ (probably not an issue)\r\n4. Our wallet has private keys (after setup we import the musig descriptor and mark that as active)\r\n\r\nOne challenge is how to include secp256k1-zkp (I suppose a proof of concept PR can just swap out the git subtree).\r\n\r\n**Wallet setup**\r\n\r\nWe obtain an xpub with origin info from ourselves and the other signers. Perhaps at the [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki) derivation of `m/87'/0'/0'`.\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n- [ ] #22341\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n\r\nPass them into `secp256k1_musig_pubkey_agg`. Apparently it's possible to aggregate an xpub in one go, instead of calling this function on each and every derived key. But there's some caveats, perhaps @jonasnick can clarify:\r\n* This results in a new xpub, which can be used just fine by a watch-only wallet (which doesn't need to know MuSig2 was involved); but\r\n* agg(xpubA, xpubB)/* != agg(xpubA/*, xpubB/*)\r\n* what about the chain codes?\r\n* do we need to track xpub and/or origin info for the other signers? (this seems practical in any case when dealing with a dumb external signer)\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n- [ ] RPC or bitcoin-util / bitcoin-wallet command that takes xpub(s), etc and does this\r\n   - since we have to call libsecp functions, a Python script doesn't seem like the right approach\r\n   - the result could be a fresh (public key) descriptor, that is either automatically or manually imported in the wallet\r\n- [ ] add musig2 descriptor (which tracks our own xpub at minimum, as well as the aggregated xpub or/and the other xpubs)\r\n\r\n**Round one nonces**\r\n\r\nOne nice aspect of MuSig2 is that the nonces required for round 1 can:\r\n1. be generated in advance\r\n2. be regenerated if a signer loses them\r\n3. support only 1 cosigner if that's easier\r\n\r\nSo it's tempting to collect a bunch of nonces during the setup. However this is very non-trivial, so let's not for now... https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23326#issuecomment-947898104\r\n\r\nInstead, we generate our nonce and request one from each participant. Probably the most practical way is to create a PSBT, put our first nonce in it, pass it to the next signer who reads ours and adds theirs. We then get the PSBT back from the last signer.\r\n\r\n- [ ] add PSBT fields\r\n\r\n**Round two: signing**\r\n\r\nPerform step 1 and 2 of [signing process](https://github.com/jonasnick/secp256k1-zkp/blob/musig2/src/modules/musig/musig.md#signing) on the nonces we have.\r\n\r\nGenerate our round 2 nonce with `secp256k1_musig_nonce_gen ` (step 4) and add those to the PSBT\r\n\r\nPass the PSBT to the other signer(s):\r\n1. if there's only 1 co-signer they can generate their nonce and `secp256k1_musig_partial_sign` in one go, and give us the result\r\n2. if there's 2+ co-signers???\r\n\r\nAdd our partial signature:\r\n\r\n- [ ] `secp256k1_musig_partial_sign` (by `walletprocesspsbt`?)\r\n\r\nGenerate full signature:\r\n\r\n- [ ] have one or more of PSBT method(s) do `secp256k1_musig_partial_sig_agg` (does not need wallet)  \r\n\r\nProfit.\r\n\r\n**Updates**\r\n2021-10-20 18:48 UTC: forget about pre committing nonces for round 1, instead use two signing rounds: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23326#issuecomment-947898104",

      "body": "@Sjors\r\n\r\nMy thinking was that once it's deemed ready, we'd forward port the MuSig(2) support in secp256k1-zkp to libsecp256k1. That'd solve the issue of implementation compatibility.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, there are indeed a number of things that need to be decided:\r\n\r\n* How to integrate into descriptors. One possibility is to only support an `agg` fragment as leaf key (e.g. `agg(xpub1/.../*,xpub2/.../*)`), but it's also possible I think to support treating `agg` of xpubs as a new \"xpub\" itself (e.g. `agg(xpub1/...,xpub2/...)/*`) for example by defining the aggregated chaincode as a hash of the child chaincodes. This complicates signing further, however, though I don't think there are fundamental problems with this (I've had some discussions with @jonasnick with this).\r\n\r\n* Signing support feels like it'd be pretty much orthogonal to the descriptors integration. My thinking is that there is no need to restrict it - whatever our descriptors signing logic support will pretty much automatically be supported by MuSig signing code once we have it. `tr()` descriptors right now are very limited (only key path, and `pk(X)` leaves), but if that gets extended, all places that were key expressions are supported in there should also deal fine with MuSig keys.\r\n\r\n* I think you're misunderstanding how the pre-generated nonce variant of MuSig2 works. It isn't sufficient to generate the nonces ahead of time - they also need to be distributed to the co-signers ahead of time (in such a way that they know which nonce is going to be used with which signing attempt, **before** that signing attempt is made). This is both logistically hard (it's essentially incompatible with descriptors, as you can't go and generate/pay to addresses before nonce material has been exchanged), and a huge footgun (all participants need to increment positions in lockstep, make sure never to reuse, need to re-distribute nonces in case of loss of key material; backups are a huge hazard, ...). In my view, this variant is for very specialized applications where latency matters, and you have a well-defined protocol between known-to-be-online co-signers already that it can be integrated into (e.g. I can imagine Lightning using them). In a more \"general purpose\" setting like Bitcoin Core should probably cater to, it feels much safer & saner to stick to the non-interactive setup + 2-round signing version of the protocol.\r\n\r\n* PSBT extensions need to be defined for both rounds (for announcing which public nonces every co-signing is going to use, and for the partial signatures).",

      "body": "> it's deemed ready, we'd forward port the MuSig(2) support in secp256k1-zkp to libsecp256k1. \r\n\r\nThat makes sense, but I suspect more people will review the secp256k1 PR, and more practical issues will come to light, if there's a (draft) Bitcoin Core integration. So it's a bit of chicken-egg.\r\n\r\n> It isn't sufficient to generate the nonces ahead of time - they also need to be distributed to the co-signers ahead of time (in such a way that they know which nonce is going to be used with which signing attempt, before that signing attempt is made)\r\n\r\nAh, the first constraint might be solvable by exporting it along with descriptors (which hardware wallets should store anyway for change detection). But the second constraint makes that a lot more complicated. \r\n\r\n> it feels much safer & saner to stick to the non-interactive setup + 2-round signing version of the protocol\r\n\r\nThat makes sense. Two rounds is annoying when any physical travel is involved, but it does seem much more realistic to implement in the near term. For a simple computer + hardware wallet setup two rounds are no problem; just a matter of calling HWI twice.\r\n\r\nI updated the description to reflect this.",

We don't strictly need answers to these questions but I feel a written policy would avoid some discussions and bikeshedding in the future. And of course, a policy won't be written in stone, we can still change it if have a reason to do so.\r\n\r\nOne way to approach this is \"features that are used by Bitcoin Core now or a have a good chance to be used by Bitcoin Core in the future\". ECDH was somewhat of an exception here but maybe it will be used in the future for BIP324 (P2P encryption).\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to add features that are useful to the wider ecosystem. Of course, this does not mean that we need to accept every feature that meets this definition --- including features means that we commit on maintaining them.\r\n\r\nI think with ECDH and Java bindings, the thinking here was more towards the latter approach. Personally I lean more towards the former idea because it avoids the need to take decisions about what to include, and it saves resources. (For example, Java bindings have been removed for a reason.)\r\n\r\nA somewhat related discussion is the one about experimental features (#817). For example, if we view musig2 as something that can be experimented around with in a fork such as secp256k1-zkp but then plan on porting it to here [0], then what's the difference to something which can go in as an experimental module? Is musig2 \"super-experimental\", is it just not clear yet if it has a good chance of ending up in Bitcoin Core or is there just really no difference in the end?\r\n\r\nRight now, I think there's a good chance that #995 will be merged, so if we wanted to deprecate experimental modules (as has been proposed in #817 but couldn't find consensus), now would be a good time.\r\n\r\n[0] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23326#issuecomment-947942068  \r\n",

      "body": "So the advantages of MuSig-DN over MuSig:\r\n* Stateless signing: signers don't need any memory between signing sessions (either within rounds, or across rounds).\r\n* Compared to MuSig1: one fewer round (but 2-round MuSig2 has the same number of rounds).\r\n\r\nIt's easy to think MuSig-DN also avoids the need for randomness at signing time as well. While that's true on its face, MuSig2 can avoid it too: as the signers need state anyway, and a private key, they can use a counter in their state together with the private key to generate randomness (use H(counter++ || privkey) as RNG).\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages are:\r\n* MuSig-DN is far slower (~1000x) in terms of CPU cost.\r\n* Complicates setup (in addition to participant keys, co-signers also need to know each other's 512-bit host key) compared to 2-round MuSig2 (but 1-round MuSig2 is harder still).\r\n* Implementation complexity (needs arithmetic over two different curves (not secp256k1), needs Bulletproofs or other NIZK proof system, and a relatively complex statement (2030 gates) to prove in it). Also, only very experimental code for MuSig-DN exists; MuSig2 has an implementation that's pretty close to production-ready.\r\n* Additional security assumptions (DDH over two different elliptic curves).\r\n\r\nSo while MuSig-DN is conceptually a nice solution to the problem of having stateful signers (which is definitely annoying, and a risk for unsafe implementations), I don't think the downsides weigh up against it. The additional signing computational cost pretty much puts it pretty out of reach of hardware signing devices, for example. Plus, its only real advantage is a concern about unsafe implementations (which deal incorrectly with signing state) - but it does so by increasing implementation complexity in other ways which also increases risk. With MuSig2, the picture is even less rosy, as the round number advantage is gone too.",

          "body": "@ryanofsky recently suggested that I should write an overview of how the various pull requests spread over different repositories relate to some bigger picture view.\r\n\r\nSee the [multisig tutorial](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multisig-tutorial.md) for how things currently work.\r\n\r\nI typically have the following future multisig wallet in mind to guide my thinking:\r\n1. a computer running Bitcoin Core holding one master key (key 1)\r\n2. one or more hardware wallets with additional keys, via HWI (keys 2 ... n)\r\n3. taproot keypath using n-of-n MuSig2\r\n4. a fallback with fewer keys after some time elapsed\r\n5. a GUI wizard to set this up (simple Python command line tool until then)\r\n\r\nThe descriptors for this could be hand crafted, but it would be nice to have:\r\n6. Miniscript compiler that can generate this\r\n\r\n**What's Missing?**\r\n\r\n- Taproot support for external signers:\r\n  - [x] #22558 (PSBT fields)\r\n  - [x] #23578 (External signer support)\r\n- [x] Timelock support for descriptors: this will be added along with full [MiniScript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) support in #24148 & #24149 (@darosior).\r\n- [ ] Ability to handle descriptors for which we have 1-of-N keys. Descriptor wallets currently expect the wallet to be either watch-only and have no keys, or to have all the keys.\r\n  - [ ] #25907 makes it possible to create a wallet _with_ a seed, but without any descriptors.\r\n  - [ ] The user would grab an xpub from it (#22341 ) to construct a multisig descriptor and then import that.\r\n  - [ ] PR's to move in the right direction: #26728 and #23544 (up for grabs) \r\n- [ ] MuSig2 setup and signing support, which requires:\r\n  - [ ] a BIP to specify new PSBT fields (tracked in #23326)\r\n  - [ ] Bitcoin Core changes; no PR yet afaik, (tracked in #23326)\r\n  - [ ] At least one other (hardware) wallet to support it\r\n      * I'm not aware of any hardware wallet working on this yet\r\n      * testing with two Bitcoin Core nodes is good start\r\n  - [ ] HWI changes: additional commands for:\r\n     - [ ] initial setup\r\n     - [ ] signing (although perhaps calling `signtx` multiple times with the right PSBT will \"just work\")\r\n     * doesn't have to be HWI of course, we would just add support new commands in the [external signer command interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md) \r\n- [ ] a simple Python setup wizard\r\n   * right now [Specter Desktop](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop) is by far the easiest way to setup a multisig wallet. But it's a huge dependency (including a bunch of NPM packages for their web interface). A simple Python script in contrib/ could call HWI to get a list of signers, ask what threshold to use, call `createwallet` to generate a blank wallet, fetch an xpub from it, and then call `importdescriptors`.\r\n   * the script could use [BIP 129 / BSMS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki) (perhaps initially without encryption)\r\n   * Specter doesn't set the external_signer wallet flag, so I have a trivial PR to do that manually: #21928 \r\n- [ ] a GUI setup wizard: once we have an established work flow, we would implement that in the GUI\r\n\r\n**Misc**\r\n\r\nI have a PR that improves address display handling on the device:\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24313\r\n\r\nEven better would be if we had a feature to ask the wallet for a signature to prove it has the private key (without passing that information to the outside world of course, see #24186). This requires BIP-322 support on our end (#24058), at least one hardware wallet to support it, and a new HWI `signmessage` command. Perhaps this can later be expanded to allow your device to prove that it (still) has the keys it needs as a co-signer.\r\n\r\nMiniscript compilers currently doesn't support Taproot (e.g. to find the optimal tree structure), but I'm assuming you can still hand craft a leaf containing MiniScript.

One possibility is to only support an `agg` fragment as leaf key (e.g. `agg(xpub1/.../*,xpub2/.../*)`), but it's also possible I think to support treating `agg` of xpubs as a new \"xpub\" itself (e.g. `agg(xpub1/...,xpub2/...)/*`) for example by defining the aggregated chaincode as a hash of the child chaincodes. This complicates signing further, however, though I don't think there are fundamental problems with this (I've had some discussions with @jonasnick with this).\r\n> \r\n\r\nWe're engraving descriptors to metal and are thus very interested in having compact or even constant sized MuSig/FROST descriptors. Is it possible to support descriptors that include only the \"aggregated xpub\" and not every key as in the proposed `agg()` expression, leading to a O(1) size instead of O(number-of-keys)?",

It will still need to be stored and backed up somewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter talking with @seedhammer  about this a bit, and thinking about it, I came to the following tentative conclusion (after changing my mind about three times :) ):\r\n\r\nMuSig2 aggregation is compatible with BIP32 derivation (that much is not controversial, it's described in the MuSig2 BIP and, well, here), but (claim:) even more specifically, a single participant in the scheme doesn't need to store more than O(1) information, in order to make partial signatures later: instead of storing their private key (call it x_i), they can store x_i_agg = H(L||P_i)x_i (their 'private aggregated key' or whatever we call it), along with the negotiated aggregate public key P_agg. \r\n(Note: i'm specifically saying there that you *don't* store L, the full list of keys).\r\nThen let's say we want to sign on BIP32 (unhardened) branch index j. That participant, i, can (a) calculate the new aggregate pubkey P_agg_j = P_agg + d_j G (where d_j is the BIP32 tweak, publically derivable if unhardened), then calculate their signature share (after following the MuSig2 nonce generation process, note that the factor 'b' only depends on the aggregate key, here P_agg_j), with the formula s_i = k_i_1 + bk_i_2 + H(P_agg_j||R_agg||m)x_i_agg. When these s_i are added, they do not form a full valid signature, but you only need to further add H(P_agg_j||R_agg||m)d_j to make it correct.\r\n\r\nIt's highly likely that that is either (a) already known or (b) wrong in some detail or possibly (c) there is some security issue with doing this [see note]. But I wasn't able to find it written anywhere?\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit off topic here, but more relevant to @seedhammer 's needs, but I believe similar logic applies to FROST (if anything it's a little easier).\r\n\r\n[note] a relevant point of course is that doing unhardened BIP32 with schnorr is only secure because of key-prefixing; ecdsa gets by without it because of non-linearity, but if we didn't use key-prefixing in BIP340 then unhardened i.e. publically derivable tweaks would allow forgery.",

I don't see how a threshold, `m < n`, can recover `n` keys and certainly not with constant O(1) storage. Can you elaborate?\r\n\r\nFor MuSig2, each signer needs all pubkeys and its secret key in order to sign. Because MuSig2 is an n-of-n multi-signature, this means that if you can retrieve sufficient secret key material to sign, you also have everything you need to recreate all public keys.\r\n\r\nNow most MuSig2 users will also be using some kind of a taptree, which may contain other MuSig2s or script multisigs. In that case, the situation is much like that in a plain script multsig. Each signer's secret key should be stored with n-minus-t (I think?) other signers' public keys, as that enables them to fully reconstruct each of the possible signing cases for each address.\r\n\r\nFor FROST, the situation is different. FROST's DKG itself results in something approximately equivalent to a Shamir's Secret Sharing split of a secret key. What is unique about that is that one can have a single Schnorr public key for which the multisig can sign and the quorum of secret key shares _alone_ is sufficient to fully reconstruct the aggregate public and secret key. It is further possible, through a ceremony similar to that used for producing a FROST signature, to produce a new sharing of keys without ever reconstructing the aggregate secret key in a single location.\r\n\r\nIn short, FROST provides a significant improvement in the safe storage of multi-signature wallets compared to MuSig2 or script multisig.",

      "body": "> To clarify, this is within _spec_ MuSig2 as described in BIP327. @AdamISZ's construction is quite possibly also secure and correct, but it's _way_ above my pay grade to evaluate the security or correctness of methods outside the spec :-P\r\n\r\nThis would be a good time to mention that - even though it's sound advice to never step outside the procedure of a spec like this, because this is cryptography - there's a different reason why my suggestion there is \"flawed\", aside from the a) b) c) that I mentioned, it's d) : this procedure isn't *useful* for MuSig2, because we are limited to N of N signing policies and the nonce generation is interactive. Hence, in a recovery process with limited data, since all N parties would have to talk to each other, or a coordinator (modulo nonce pre-processing maybe?), they could also communicate pubkeys anyway. Instead of each party storing x_agg_i = H(L||P_i)x_i and P_agg as I analyzed there, they could each store x_i and P_i and the agg keys are trivially recovered.\r\n\r\nPossibly the point I raised there is still of interest, though. I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nAnd to reiterate, and as @brandonblack has gone into more detail on, this question is much more of interest with FROST.",

It will still need to be stored and backed up somewhere.\r\n\r\nAs @AdamISZ notes above it would be sufficient to store the aggregate pubkey, let some third party provide the individual pubkeys and then check whether the aggregate of the individual pubkeys matches the stored aggregate pubkey. Due to the collision resistance property of key aggregation, the check only passes if the provided individual pubkeys were correct. Not sure if that follows the design philosophy of descriptors.\r\n\r\n@AdamISZ's proposed modification to the signing algorithm also looks secure (even if it may not be as useful) as it purely changes internal caching and leaves the output indistinguishable from the original signing algorithm.",

If you remove information like which the co-signer public keys are, then signing no longer works. Of course, you *could* get that information from your cosigners, but if that's acceptable, why can't you get the descriptor in its entirety from the cosigners (and if desired, just keep the (master) private key)?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I guess in case we're looking at MuSig2 aggregation of multiple keys, and then applying BIP32 derivation to the aggregated key, there is a point, as it'd let you derive keys without needing to know the individual participants' keys. You'd still need to know the participants at signing time, but if all you want is a descriptor for address derivation, this suffices. It's also related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24114.",

          "body": "One of the most useful properties of the TapRoot upgrade - and the support for Schnorr signatures which came along with it - is the fact that we can now use simple trustless key aggregation protocols like MuSig, and powerful scriptless contract primitives like Adaptor Signatures (AKA verifiably encrypted signatures). \r\n\r\nI don't see any mention of MuSig or Adaptor Signatures in the code, issues, or PRs in this repo. I'd like to propose we add these tools, as they are very important building blocks for modern bitcoin devs.\r\n\r\nAs for the best road to this goal, I'd be happy to shamelessly shill [my own MuSig implementation](https://github.com/conduition/musig2), for which I recently [finished a draft PR adding adaptor signatures](https://github.com/conduition/musig2/pull/1). It's fully compatible with [the current draft of BIP327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki), and doesn't pull in any significant new dependencies (it uses the `secp256k1` crate for curve math).\r\n\r\nWe could also use @LLFourn's [`schnorr_fun` crate](https://github.com/LLFourn/secp256kfun/tree/master/schnorr_fun), although this would necessitate switching to `secp256kfun` for curve math.",
