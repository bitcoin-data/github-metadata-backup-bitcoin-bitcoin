    "title": "rfc: virtio-vsock for RPC and IPC",
    "body": "> virtio-vsock provides a way for applications running on a guest VM and the host system to communicate with each other using the standard socket interface (`socket`, `connect`, `bind`, `listen`, `accept`). It defines a new socket address family (`AF_VSOCK`) and uses a (context id, port) pair of integers for identifying processes. The host system always has 2 as its context id while each guest VM is assigned a unique context id on startup.\n\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/9e91613d2da1b3d6cfb1c77681444e688ce99cf4/vm_tools/docs/vsock.md\n\nIt was first suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32802#issuecomment-3000963484:\n\n>> I'm dockerizing Sjors 's Stratum V2 sidecar (`bitcoin-mine`) such that it's able to reach a Bitcoin Core node running on the host.\n\n>> My host is macOS, and Docker is Linux, which means they don't have a shared kernel and their Unix socket descriptors don't match.\n\n> It shouldn't be too hard to support `AF_VSOCK` (virtio sockets) for communication between vm host and guest processes. These should be more secure and more performant than TCP sockets.\n\nPerhaps it's useful for RPC too.",

      "body": "It should be pretty easy to support vsock if we want that. I think it would only require a change to the [`ipc::ParseAddress`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2444488f6ad32dcbbed51a73cd4f59ff3a239e32/src/ipc/process.cpp#L71-L98) function and updates to documentation and tests.\n\nTCP support could also be added by modifying the `ParseAddress` function, but I'd be wary of doing that since it would not really be safe without authentication (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32802#issuecomment-3000963484).\n\nI'm not sure if vsock support would actually be helpful for docker on mac. It would depend on whether docker for mac exposes any vsock options. I believe some hypervisors like qemu do, and others like virtualbox just don't.\n\n\n\n",
