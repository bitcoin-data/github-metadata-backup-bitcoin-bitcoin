    "title": "Increasing self-hosted runner raw performance",
    "body": "_disclaimer_: The following should **not** replace us investigating and fixing the root causes of timeouts and intermittent test runtime performance.\r\n\r\nNow seems an opportune time to open a discussion on some investigation I have been doing into our self-hosted runners, as our CI has been struggling again recently.\r\n\r\nI wanted to see what the cost/benefit implications would be on upgrading our self-hosted runners would look like. Hooking up a single [Hetzner AX52](https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ax52/) (70 €/month) as a self-hosted runner saw each job run on average 3-5x faster (result image shown at end), which is not surprising in itself.\r\n\r\nIIUC correctly we currently have about 25 low powered, shared vCPU x86_64 runners (plus a sprinkling of ARM ones). If we had the appetite, and could find the funding, we might consider:\r\n\r\n1. upgrade the x86_64 runners to 12 dedicated CPU servers. At 70€ this would total 840€ per month, or 10080€ per year, vs current spend of ~3840€, so 2.5x more cost for 3-5x more speed. This feels like a decent return.\r\n\r\nalternatively\r\n\r\n2. Bump our current (shared vCPU) runners to the next \"level\" up. If e.g. [these](https://github.com/maflcko/bitcoin-core-qa-assets/wiki/Persistent-workers#set-up-servers) are the runners in use for us today, we could increment the CPX21s to CPX31s, and the CPX31s to CPX41s for a monthly cost of 505.6€ vs a current spend of 320€. I did not test performance gains of this path.\r\n\r\nWe could also\" just spend more\" buying larger numbers of the same (low-powered) runners, but IMO this would not be as effective as reducing the runtime of CI jobs, and eliminating CI run timeouts. Moving away from vCPUs feels like the correct choice, if we can, as it's possible that random contention on these could contribute to \"random\" timeouts and failures.\r\n\r\nAdditional thoughts in no particular order:\r\n\r\n- I have likely not considered all the benefits of having larger numbers of lower powered runners. Comments welcomed on this.\r\n  - These more powerful runners also (all) come with (some) more disk space, so we could potentially do things like configure total ccache size (across all jobs) to be something like 100's of GB, and try and maximize those cache hits!\r\n- I am not sure what the developer tradeoff is for \"CI startup time\" (i.e. when a job is picked up by a runner) vs \"CI runtime\".\r\n- Shold we employ a more scientific approach, which could be to caclulate total compute/€ and just get whatever wins out by that metric.\r\n\r\nI'd be curious to hear thoughts on whether this is something worth us looking at any further, or if folks have investigated this before and what they found.\r\n\r\n#### AX52 test\r\n\r\n1. A typical CI run using current runners (on a good day):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d90bae58-0a96-460c-ad5d-210b1f9278c5)\r\n\r\n2.

Some of these were second runs but ccache was not hit in all of them. E.g. it hit 0% in `depends, debug`, but 100% in `nowallet, libbitcoinkernel`. The run is here: https://cirrus-ci.com/build/6496417768800256\r\n\r\nIMO that @achow101 didn't see a great speedup further hints to me that dedicated resources are having quite a large impact here.",

      "body": "The thing is that workers are \"shuffled\" by type, so one run may happen one one machine and another run of the same task may happen on another machine. It is of course possible to make each task its own type, but that seems a bit too much maintenance overhead when tasks are added or removed in one branch, but not all. As you mentioned earlier, it is of course also possible to set up a remote ccache. However, I think this is similarly going to be more maintenance overhead and extra moving parts, with the additional downside of added latency due to the distance. So I think the best way forward would be to have all workers of the same type on the same machine.

My intuition says that if we had multiple servers, even if a re-run took place on a different machine, we'd likely get a _pretty decent_ cache hit from another run or a previous master build\r\n\r\nRight. It is unclear whether this is worth it. I think when it comes to builds on master, the speed doesn't matter at all, because no one is waiting for the result to appear immediately. So the thing where the cache matters a bit could be a  pull request. However, for a first push, the cache hit rate will be low either way. The only thing that could be optimized would be a (little) re-push to the same pull request (assuming little to no changes to master in the meantime), or any push on a \"little\" pull request (which can then use the cache from master). But I don't have a number how often that happens and whether it is worth it to optimize for.\r\n\r\n> (or we simply get the benefit of a new, super-fast non-shared CPU vs the current ones today).\r\n\r\nHetzner offers so many different CPUs, and I didn't want to rent all of them to find the \"fastest\" one. But reading the docs (https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d.html and https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-7-7700.html), it seems like AX102 may be faster than AX52. So that could be another idea to look into?\r\n\r\nI think when it comes to \"sharing\" CPUs, the CI performs better by \"sharing\" (putting several workers on the same machine), because most tests are bottle-necked by a single long-running test. IIRC this is true for the unit tests (where the tail is the secp tests), the functional tests (where the tail is an \"extended\" or otherwise long running test), as well as the fuzz tests (which have a few long-running tests). Imagining a case where a pull request was merged, and a few pulls need rebase as a result, there may be several pushes at the same time (as well as the master build). Having servers with a single worker on them will make the servers go over the tasks one-by-one, whereas having the same servers with more workers on them allows them to possibly service all tasks at once. Given that the workload in this case (Bitcoin Core CI) is CPU-bound (and not IO-bound), the \"sharing\" approach with the same number of servers should never be slower. However, I haven't benchmarked this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> > Did a quick sanity check with a 100G shared ccache on a single machine `cpx51` and all tasks finished in under a hour.

I just wanted to check a single shared ccache on the machine. I left `MAKEJOBS` as-is.",

Not sure what I must've been looking at to come to the wrong conclusion here, but thanks for double-checking.\r\n\r\nIt isn't wrong. I presume it may still have to be set for the msan task, but this can probably be done in a follow-up and shouldn't be an initial blocker here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Given that the workload in this case (Bitcoin Core CI) is CPU-bound (and not IO-bound), the \"sharing\" approach with the same number of servers should never be slower. However, I haven't benchmarked this.\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay, I finally got around to checking this. Apart from the inital clone+apt, the tasks are not IO-bound (at least not on Hetzner Cloud). Also checking a full build on two `cpx51` for each type (`small` and `medium`) shows that given a fixed number of machines, it is faster to put more workers on them, than not to. (Having many workers is needed when many commits are built at the same time. For example, a merge to master and 7 pull request pushes in half an hour are not rare. That is 80 tasks that need to be built, which is faster with more workers than with less)\r\n\r\nI compared two runs: A fresh install of the machines with just one worker each and another fresh install with the number of workers equal to the number of tasks.\r\n\r\nThe first one took 2h:40 end-to-end overall, the second one just 1h:40 and all tasks started at the same time. Obviously this doesn't represent reality, because ccache is usually filled and llvm doesn't need to be built from scratch each time, but it should give the idea. (I tested with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30935 for the llvm build)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2024-10-01 at 18 08 49](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9956325-d1e1-4ae3-b372-a543f43e13b7)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2024-10-01 at 20 14 40](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/553c9e82-e50e-4630-b213-94f38d1adc8c)\r\n\r\nGoing forward, I'd say to try AX162 and then watch it for a week or two in the real setting.

I don't recall exactly how much it helps with the install/upgrade part of the job.

Just worried this may decrease our total throughput if these previous assumptions are correct (and not mitigated by better caching and faster CPU etc.)?\r\n\r\n",
