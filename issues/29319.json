    "title": "Cluster mempool, CPFP carveout, and V3 transaction policy",
    "body": "Opening an issue for high-level discussion, as the PR that implements this has gotten difficult to follow.\r\n\r\n### Cluster mempool\r\n\r\nWork is underway to [redesign the mempool](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393/1) with different topology constraints on the transaction graph than exist today.  I originally described this proposal in a github issue (#27677), and have shared a draft implementation (#28676).  In brief, with a new mempool design we could simultaneously: fix bugs with mempool eviction and the incentive compatibility of RBF replacements; achieve improved performance; eliminate the ancestor/descendant limits (with the introduction of a likely more relaxed \"cluster\" limit); and likely be in a position to better implement complex behaviors like package validation and package rbf.\r\n\r\n### CPFP carveout is not compatible with cluster mempool\r\n\r\nAs I explain [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393#the-cpfp-carveout-rule-can-no-longer-be-supported-12), I believe the CPFP carveout rule (introduced in #15681) is not compatible with the new design. Since some users may be relying on this behavior, we should come up with a workaround to avoid breaking existing applications.\r\n\r\n### V3 transaction policy\r\n\r\nDescribed in #28948, the v3 transaction policy is a proposal to introduce topology restrictions on unconfirmed transactions with `nVersion=3` (which are currently non-standard for relay, and would be made standard under the proposal).  Specifically, v3 transactions would be:\r\n- opted-in to RBF replacement policies (whatever those may be, as they evolve in our project)\r\n- permitted to only be part of mempool clusters that are at most of size 2 (meaning 1 parent/1 child)\r\n- required to have any unconfirmed parents or children also be marked v3 (and therefore subject to these rules)\r\n- bounded in size to at most 1000 vbytes, if the child of an unconfirmed (and therefore v3) parent\r\n\r\nBy offering a policy rule that can enforce a much tighter topology restriction that the current ancestor/descendant limits, we hope to achieve a few things:\r\n\r\n#### Replacing CPFP carveout (with a new sibling-replacement policy)\r\n\r\nWe can provide a way to achieve the goals of the CPFP carveout rule even if the existing carevout rule were to be dropped. As explained in [this post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-November/016518.html), the use-case contemplated by the CPFP carveout rule was one where a single transaction might have two spendable outputs, each spendable by a different party, and that either party should be able to spend their output without hitting global topology limits, provided that their spending transaction was bounded in size and had no other unconfirmed parents. If the v3 policy rule were to be applied to the LN commitment transactions described in that post, then neither of the two outputs that are spendable could be used to hit the limits that carveout is designed to bypass. \r\n\r\nSo if we couple the v3 policy with an RBF rule that would allow one spend of a v3 transaction to replace an existing lower-feerate spend of that same parent -- something we call *sibling eviction* and has a draft implementation in #29306 -- then I believe we will have enacted a set of policies that replicate the CPFP carveout use case. \r\n\r\n#### Provide a general way for fee bumping to work better\r\n\r\nEven apart from the needs of layer 2 protocols, the new v3 policy serves as a general way to bypass the issue of RBF being expensive when a child transaction is created that has a large fee (and is typically large in size, allowing for it to be low feerate).  This has been the source of user complaints since our RBF policies were first deployed, and by bounding the size of child transactions we effectively can limit the amount of additional fee a user would need to pay due to the presence of such children.  \r\n\r\nNote, of course, that this property is also what makes the sibling-eviction-policy described above workable.\r\n\r\n### Proposed roadmap\r\n\r\nTo unblock the cluster mempool project, I think we need the following:\r\n1. Deployment of the V3 policy rules (current proposal is #28948)\r\n2. Deployment of V3 sibling eviction rbf rules (current proposal is #29306)\r\n\r\nThen, projects that use CPFP carveout would need to be able to adopt the new policy rules.  After the last LN spec discussion, I understand that migrating their commitment transactions to use a new format (even just a change in version number) might take time to coordinate, and that in the meantime we should simply use some other unique markers to identify those commitment transactions, and implicitly imbue such transactions with the v3 policy rules.  However, doing so would eliminate the ability to batch-CPFP several unconfirmed commitment transactions at once (although this isn't reliable anyway today, since the carveout protections don't apply to this case, but perhaps this sometimes works fine and is more efficient).\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me if that final step -- of imbuing transactions with v3 policy, rather than requiring explicit opt-in -- is needed before we move further forward with cluster mempool, or even if doing so would be acceptable to the broader community, but I think we could entertain that idea as a way to assist the LN project with migration and to decouple progress in this project from upgrade timelines in that one.\r\n\r\n### Feedback\r\n\r\nWhile we're still working out implementation details in the v3 and v3-sibling-eviction PRs, it would be great to get concept ACKs on this roadmap from any users of the current CPFP carveout policy.  In particular, please provide feedback on:\r\n1. whether there are use cases of CPFP carveout that are not covered by the V3 proposal as I described above, and \r\n2. whether the \"imbued v3\" behavior described above should be treated as a blocker for CPFP carveout removal as well, or if it's a bad idea due to (eg) breaking the ability to batch-CPFP (or any other reason)",

          "title": "[5/5]sweep: introduce budget-based deadline aware fee bumper",
          "body": "This PR introduces a budget-based deadline-aware fee bumper that solves the following issues,\r\n1. overshooting fees - the sweeper sometimes sweeps an input without considering its cost.\r\n2. RBF oblivious - the sweeper cannot properly create RBF-compliant txns.\r\n3. naive fee management - the sweeper relies solely on the fee estimator to make decisions on fee rates.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR and its dependencies have refactored the sweeper so it's easier to question its architecture and implement more advanced fee bumping strategies in the future. The dependencies,\r\n- #8345\r\n- #8147 \r\n- #8422\r\n- #8423\r\n- #8148\r\n\r\nReplaces #7549 and fixes #4215\r\n\r\n## Definitions\r\n\r\nA budget is the amount of sats you are willing to pay when sweeping a given input. Often the case, it's proportional to the bitcoin value of the input. For instance, say you are willing to pay 50% to sweep an HTLC of 100,000 sats, the budget would be 50,000. On the other hand, the budget is dependent on the context, or the type of inputs,\r\n- for a CPFP purpose anchor, although the value is only 330 sats, the budget would be the value under protection, which is the value from the incoming or outgoing HTLC with the smallest CLTV value.\r\n- for first-level HTLC txns, the budget is the proportional to the HTLC value although this budget cannot be directly spent from it because it must all go to the second-level HTLC, which means we need to borrow this budget from other inputs.\r\n\r\nBecause we define the budget beforehand, it makes sure we won't end up paying more fees than the inputs value.\r\n\r\nA deadline defines a time preference, expressed in blocks, that an input must be confirmed by, as otherwise we may lose money. Among all the outputs generated from an FC, only three of them are time-sensitive, detailed below,\r\n- `to_local` output, which is currently swept using a conf target of 6. There's no time pressure on sweeping this UTXO as it can only be swept by us.\r\n- first level outgoing HTLCs, which are currently swept using a conf target of 6. The deadline is the CLTV value from this HTLC's corresponding incoming HTLC, as if that CLTV is reached, our upstream peer can take the incoming HTLC via the timeout path, and our downstream peer can take the outgoing HTLC via the preimage path. In this PR, we use the `nLockTime` field as the deadline, as the deadline defines how different inputs can be grouped together, and because the `SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY` sighash flag, only the txns sharing the same `nLockTime` can exist in the same tx, thus we use this field as the deadline for outgoing HTLCs.\r\n- first level incoming HTLCs, which are also swept using a conf target of 6. The deadline is defined as the CLTV value used by the remote. Since we must already have the preimage to perform this sweep, we must make sure it confirms before this HTLC being collected by the remote via the timeout path.\r\n- second level transactions, which are swept using a conf target of 6. There are no time pressure here.\r\n- anchor output before the FC is confirmed, which is used for CPCP purpose. Atm we already have a deadline defined for this type of sweeping, and we will continue to use it.\r\n- anchor output after FC is confirmed, there's no time pressure here. Although it can be collected by anyone after 16 blocks (15 if the FC is confirmed), it doesn't provide many economical incentives to sweep it.\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\nOn a high level, when inputs are added to the `UtxoSweeper` via the entry point `SweepInput`, the sweeper will periodically check their states and ask the `UtxoAggregator` to group these inputs into different input sets. Each set is sent to the `Bumper` to construct an RBF-compliant tx, broadcast it, and monitor it and perform fee bumps if needed. The `Bumper` will consult the `FeeFunction` to get a fee rate to use. In details,\r\n- `UtxoAggregator` is an interface that defines a `ClusterInputs` method which returns a list of `InputSet` interfaces. There are two implementations of `UtxoAggregator`, `SimpleAggregator` which retains the old clustering logic, and a new `BudgetAggregator` which groups inputs based on budget and deadline.\r\n- `Bumper` is implemented by `TxPublisher`, which takes care of tx creation and broadcast. It leverages `TestMempoolAccept` to make the broadcast RBF-aware.\r\n- `FeeFunction` is implemented by `LinearFeeFunction`, which is a simple function that increases the fee rate linearly based on the blocks left till deadline. There are more advanced algorithms in #4215, which can be easily implemented in the future.\r\n\r\n### RBF tx, not inputs\r\n\r\nThere's an alternative approach which quickly ditched due to its high level of complexity. In this PR, the `Bumper` will take the input set packaged by `UtxoAggregator` and perform an RBF on this set. Suppose a few blocks pass by, the `UtxoAggregator` may choose to package the set differently based on current mempool condition and the budget supplied. For instance, if a set of three inputs are made, but later on `UtxoAggregator` decides to create three sets, each containing one of the inputs. It would then be very difficult for the `Bumper` to handle the RBF. However, I want to mention it here as this can be a future optimization task.\r\n\r\n### No more repeated RBF logic\r\n\r\nPreviously we have implemented simple RBF logic and CPFP rules in `lnd`, while the actual rules can be [very complicated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8148#issuecomment-1887625772). With the help of `TestMempoolAccept`, we no longer need to care about the implementation details about these rules as we can now use this RPC as a validator to guide us creating an RBF-compliant txns. The only downside here is for neutrino backends, we don't have this RPC available - we shouldn't give up tho, with the extra fee info stored in sweeper, we can still perform a native RBF with limited efficacy, since without a mempool, there's little we can do.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n- [ ] add minimal RBF support for neutrino backend\r\n- [ ] fix `BumpFee` RPC\r\n- [ ] add unit tests\r\n- [ ] fix current itests\r\n- [ ] add new itests\r\n- [ ] add design diagram\r\n- [ ] add readme in sweeper\r\n",

So an attacker who simply did a straightforward pinning attack on an ephemeral anchor spend could force the defender to spend an additional:\r\n\r\n    20sat/vB * 1000vB = 20,000sat = $8 USD\r\n\r\njust to get their transaction mined, at almost no cost to themselves. We need a better solution than that. One obvious one would be to make the 1000vB limit much smaller, eg the same size as a 2-in, 1 out, anchor spend. A Replace-by-Fee-Rate carveout for this specific case is another potential solution. (and as @ariard mentions, replace-by-fee-rate in general is a solution; IIUC one-shot replace-by-fee-rate will be quite a bit easier to implement with the cluster mempool work)",

I showed that V3 does not, as attackers can still cause defenders to pay significant amounts of money in response to pinning attacks, and that the way we intend to use V3 with ephemeral anchors is quite possibly *worse* than the status quo as anyone can be the attacker. I also provided a simple fix, and some less simple fixes.\r\n\r\n@ariard has also been discussing similar high-level design considerations separately.\r\n\r\nThese are all items appropriate for high-level discussion to make sure the design of cluster mempool/V3 is correct and worth implementing (and in this case, I gave an argument that cluster mempool may be worthwhile without V3).",

My goal is to establish whether a particular set of policy rules would be a suitable replacement for carveout.  You and ariard are discussing pinning more generally, and I infer from your prior comments that you think CPFP is a mistaken idea to begin with.  So I assume that means you don't believe that dropping the CPFP carveout rule should be a big deal either, is that a fair statement?\r\n\r\nThat is fine with me, and I'll take it as a concept ACK from you that you don't think the cluster mempool efforts need to be gated on worrying about the effects of CPFP carveout.  However, I believe that there are users of the CPFP carveout policy that the software supports today, and I'd like to hear from **them** about this topic before proposing that we drop support.\r\n\r\nTake detailed discussions of pinning vectors and potential solutions elsewhere.",

The only requirement here, then, would be that any v3-auto-tx-type-match logic allow standard rules for transactions which otherwise match but which have in-mempool ancestors.\r\n\r\nI think that pattern-matching / imbuing v3 is doable (that sounds like a concept ack for v3?). Assuming sibling eviction in v3, so far, it seems like it applies nicely to existing commitment transactions without any modifications. On the LN side, the requirement is no other unconfirmed inputs in the child, implying no batching.\r\n\r\nIIRC during the meeting, people said that LND (cc @roasbeef) are the only ones who do batching?\r\n\r\nSupporting batched bumping is definitely a goal, and was originally part of the v3 design until we [realized](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#issuecomment-1320295394) it created a pinning problem and couldn't support it.\r\n\r\nSince we're on the topic of not breaking the usage of past features, though, batched CPFP and CPFP Carve Out have always been mutually exclusive. The extra descendant is given a ancestor limit of 2, which means it cannot be CPFPing more than one parent (see [code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ac923e70e7cec603abd207f104dbabfe675d59b2/src/validation.cpp#L936) and [proposal](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-November/016518.html)). That suggests that there can't be any transactions that are relying on both features simultaneously, so supporting such transactions shouldn't be a blocker for cluster mempool.\r\n(^I know I don't have to explain this to you but wanted to write this explanation somewhere).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Assuming sibling eviction in v3, so far, it seems like it applies nicely to existing commitment transactions without any modifications.

It seems to me that sibling eviction rules could efficiently handle the 1-child-multiple-parent cases, but I may be missing something. I thought that the rules could be:\r\n\r\n- a v3 unconfirmed transaction may have multiple unconfirmed v3 parents (but is limited by the 1000 vbytes threshold)\r\n- a v3 unconfirmed transaction may have at most one unconfirmed child\r\n- a v3 transaction that has unconfirmed parents cannot have unconfirmed children\r\n\r\nThose rules ensure that we have at most two generations of unconfirmed v3 txs in a package. When evaluating sibling eviction, it's thus easy to figure out the replaced package, it only consists of the sibling with all of its unconfirmed parents. We can then apply package RBF rules (not the current RBF rules though) to efficiently replace this, and it should be easier to evaluate whether it's more incentive compatible?\r\n\r\nIt does require different package RBF rules than BIP 125 though:\r\n\r\n- we mustn't apply BIP 125 rules 2 and 3\r\n- rule 4 should probably be replaced by an increase in total package feerate\r\n\r\nThis is probably much more complex than the current sibling eviction proposal, and I may be missing important details as well, so feel free to ignore!",

What I have understood so far is that we want to only consider transactions with no in-mempool ancestors, which have exactly two 330-satoshi outputs (did I get that number right?). Do you have more criteria we should be looking at?  It seems like a good next step would be for someone to code up something that tries to capture what you are talking about, and try to verify on historical data that it wouldn't catch anything it shouldn't.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

While I have my reservations about CPFP, the fact is we've shipped a lot of Lightining implementations that rely on the CPFP carveout for safety and we have to continue to provide that functionality for the forseeable future. Indeed, this complexity is one reason why I'm dubious about rushing into the half-baked V3 proposal, as the complexity of it will simply have to live on in mempool policy for a long time to come if we adopt it.\r\n\r\nSee: https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review#recommendations\r\n\r\nI did not suggest that we get rid of CPFP in my V3 transactions review. Even though I recommended against shipping V3, I even said that we should try to ship package relay to make existing anchor/CPFP-using Lightning implementations less broken.",

So long as the N block threshold isn't too large, transactions that don't quite reach the threshold have a decent chance of getting mined eventually. Similarly, since the threshold is dynamic, it's likely that the threshold will reduce at some point, allowing a fee-bump will put it over the threshold.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the proposal is the following. We introduce a dynamic N block threshold, where everything inside the threshold is replace-by-feerate, everything under is replace-by-fee as of today. The “dynamism\" trigger is scheduled on the mempool congestion rate (?) yet to be defined.\r\n\r\nI think you might have threshold effect where the parent commitment tx is in the replace-by-fee mempool group segment and a high-fee CPFP arrives qualifying the whole package  to be reconsidered in the replace-by-feerate mempool group segment. Reconsideration might be computationally expensive.

      "body": "> It looks like removal of CPFP carve out is not a concern for you; you just don't think v3 is a good idea. If that's the case, there is no need to post general criticisms of v3 here. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28948 description for a list of threads dedicated to discussing v3.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate a more gently online communication tone from someone  I spent time sharing a lot of information (cf. my old gist [“Mitigating Tx-Relay Jamming for Time-Sensitive Contract Protocols”](https://gist.github.com/ariard/7e509bf2c81ea8049fd0c67978c521af)) on all those issues  circa 2020 / 2021. Thanks.\r\n\r\n> Unless your alternative proposal is relevant to CPFP carve out removal and/or cluster mempool, it is off topic here. Again, there are separate threads that are more appropriate.\r\n\r\nYes there are zero-to-minimal security benefits provided by the CPFP carve out as LN implementations as an adversary can nullify the carve-out with NTA pinnings - today. And I’ll bet that half of the LN implementations have not implemented broadcast-CPFP-on-remote counterparty commitment transaction.\r\n\r\nIn my reasonable opinion, the CPFP carve-out can be deprecated *now* without necessity of introducing V3 transaction policy as a preliminary step. I think all non-lightning use-cases can upgrades their own protocol transaction format in the same way than lightning to introduce a single CPFP with two script path branches.",

          "body": "See #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nDelving Bitcoin discussion thread: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/v3-transaction-policy-for-anti-pinning/340\r\nDelving Bitcoin discussion for LN usage: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/lightning-transactions-with-v3-and-ephemeral-anchors/418\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- There are various pinning problems with RBF and our general ancestor/descendant limits. These policies help mitigate many pinning attacks and make package RBF feasible (see #28984 which implements package RBF on top of this). I would focus the most here on Rule 3 pinning. [1][2]\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see #27677 and #28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n\r\nV3 policy is for \"Priority Transactions.\" [3][4] It allows users to opt in to more restrictive topological limits for shared transactions, in exchange for the more robust fee-bumping abilities that offers. Even though we don't have cluster limits, we are able to treat these transactions as having as having a maximum cluster size of 2.\r\n\r\nImmediate benefits:\r\n\r\n- You can presign a transaction with 0 fees (not just 1sat/vB!) and add a fee-bump later.\r\n- Rule 3 pinning is reduced by a significant amount, since the attacker can only attach a maximum of 1000vB to your shared transaction.\r\n \r\nThis also enables some other cool things (again see #27463 for overall roadmap):\r\n- Ephemeral Anchors\r\n- Package RBF for these 1-parent-1-child packages. That means e.g. a commitment tx + child can replace another commitment tx using the child's fees.\r\n- We can transition to a \"single anchor\" universe without worrying about package limit pinning. So current users of CPFP carve out would have something else to use.\r\n- We can switch to a cluster-based mempool [5] (#27677 #28676), which removes CPFP carve out [6].\r\n\r\n[1]: Original mailing list post and discussion about RBF pinning problems https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff, https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html\r\n[2]: A FAQ is \"we need this for cluster mempool, but is this still necessary afterwards?\" There are some pinning issues that are fixed here and not fully fixed in cluster mempool, so we will still want this or something similar afterward.\r\n[3]: Mailing list post for v3 https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html\r\n[4]: Original PR #25038 also contains a lot of the discussion\r\n[5]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393/7\r\n[6]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393#the-cpfp-carveout-rule-can-no-longer-be-supported-12",

      "body": "So carve-out was introduced back by #15681 with motivation to allow one extra single ancestor tx.\r\nAfter testing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/6337b978e77a4e1f93bb009958db7c9a619323df you can always replace a long-chain of transactions with a higher-fee candidate. Carve-out is already broken today due to NTA pinning.\r\nLN devs can upgrade to have a single output on each commitment with one branch for each counterparty.\r\nAt least this should conserve the same level of robustness for non-adversarial env (synchronous broadcast of commitments)\r\n\r\n> Using a datalogging and replaying system that I have, I did some analysis of what the effect the idea of imbuing LN commitment transaction spends with v3 semantics would have had in 2023.\r\n\r\nUnclear to me what is the hypothesis this analysis aims to corroborate or invalidate.\r\nI’m understanding as “assume all v3 semantics are opt-in by all LN commitment transaction owners and see success/failure”.\r\nFor high number of batch CPFP spending LN commitment transactions, it's already unsafe. (depends `max_accepted_htlcs)\r\nSo it can be okay to be more restrictive actually in the deployment of any imbuance mechanism for LN transactions.\r\n(not endorsing v3 - just pointing out that some analyzed LN traffic sounds intrinsically unsafe at first sight).",

      "body": "@ariard I agree that this would be simpler if there is just 1 anchor output (see also @instagibbs' proposal for ephemeral anchors, fwiw).  But (a) that is not up to this project to decide; (b) you still need some kind of pinning solution if a too-large spend is created (which v3 provides -- while no other workable proposals have been put forward); and (c) even then it sounds like it would take LN some time to coordinate an upgrade to a 1-anchor system (whether EA or 2 branches of a single script, or whatever else could be on the table).\r\n\r\nAs a developer on this project, I think we should generally strive to not break downstream users' applications unnecessarily.  I also don't want this project to be blocked waiting on users to upgrade to a better way of doing things; the sense I got from the LN spec developers is that coordinated upgrades take time, which seems reasonable to me on its face.\r\n\r\nI believe that we have work in progress to mitigate many (most?) of the pinning scenarios that have been discussed in recent years.  However it is a significant amount of work, and each piece requires careful review -- so it is a challenge to present a complete solution all at once (though @glozow and @instagibbs have both done great work to try to demonstrate large pieces of these ideas at various times).  Pinning is also not the only thing we are trying to solve -- in my view it's far from the most important problem we face -- so some pieces of the pinning solution should rightfully be blocked on us solving bigger problems, such as making RBF incentive compatible, and making mining and eviction use the same transaction score metric (so that we don't evict things we might want to mine).\r\n\r\nOverall, I think at some point we need to pick a path forward and get it done. The steps I've described above (v3, v3-sibling-eviction, and imbuing LN commitment transaction spends with v3 semantics) are close to ready at this point and would immediately address the pinning problem that carveout currently solves, without having to wait for LN developers to upgrade their systems. If we don't go down that path, then we're either breaking users or blocked until they upgrade their spec -- both bad options in my view.  \r\n\r\nIf you have alternate work to share to address the variety of problems that have been discussed, please feel free to open PRs and try to get review for an alternative roadmap.

      "body": "@sdaftuar While I'm sharing your opinion on the lack of necessity to not break downstream users’s applications unnecessarily, I think you're missing my present observation on the lack of current benefit of the 2 anchor outputs on LN commitment transactions. As my test demonstrate just above, in the occurence of an adversarial scenario, the abibility to CPFPcon a counterparty commitment transaction can be neutralized by broadcasting one of the 2 commitment states in the target mempool. In the occurence of hazardous scenario (e.g concurrent unilateral force-closure), network mempools might be partitioned with propagation of the asymmetric states, and the fee-bumping CPFP can't propagate as expected. As said above, the carve-out mechanism is broken since its initial implementation in 2019, as its security benefits have not been analyzed correctly at that time — to be fair we're far more knowledgeable on this area now that we used to be.\r\n\r\nBeyond, I'm very doubtful broadcasting a CPFP on a counterparty commitment transaction is _currently_ implemented by all LN implementations, at the very least I can't remember it's done by LDK or CLN. It might be implemented by Eclair or LND, yet I would very doubtul again they broadcast a CPFP on the latest 2 valid counterparty commitment transaction (allowed during the CS - RAA phase). So I believe that current carve-out mechanism can be deprecated today as it's useless without package relay, and it's not even implemented and deployed correctly by LN implementations. They can upragade directly to one of the alternative (e.g 2 branches of a single script).\r\n\r\nOn the pinning mitigations, it turns out v3 is very far to address all the pinning scenarios known since years (e.g NTA pinning originally described in 2020) and it still offers significant exploitation areas with currently selected parameters and child coverage only approach. This is very uncertain that actually constraining the child only solve long-term pinning, and that an approach like replace-by-feerate isn't more accurate to solve NTA-like class of pinning as it's removing package malleability. On the EA idea itself, it turns out it might alter badly miners incentives as its own author has recognized himself. We're doing safety-first engineering and going for a short-sighted solution only makes the problem worst on the long-term as we're increasing re-deployment cost of any newer and more efficient pinning mitigation.\r\n\r\nI do share the sentiment that we shouldn't be rightfully blocked on coming to consensus on a pinning solution and be rightfully blocked on solving bigger problems, and yes I recognize that RBF incentive compatibility is a serious issue, as we all figure out during the initial deployment of `mempoolfullrbf`. However I'm yet to understand why solving pinning and deploying cluster have to be linked together ? In my mind they're orthogonal and there is no need to commit and \"package\" them on a single roadmap. If there is any substantial technical issue why they should be linked together, thanks to clarify.\r\n\r\nCalling to “ship-forward” and get stuff it done, on its own justification intrinsically, appears in my eyes as sign of “process fatigue”. In the current case of such phenomena, we shall take time to build a stronger technical consensus, an engineering mindset you have yourself advocated in the past (cf. [Taproot activation](https://medium.com/@sdaftuar/on-taproot-activation-and-consensus-changes-in-bitcoin-5b3453e91c4e)).\r\n\r\nThe path forward in my opinion is still have to LN developers uprading their systems in a non-coordinated fashion on the question of carve-out output, while we can still make progress in parallel on solving RBF incentive compatibility. In the present state of deployed codebases, there is no need to \"point-lock\" the issues.",

      "body": "> Beyond, I'm very doubtful broadcasting a CPFP on a counterparty commitment transaction is currently implemented by all LN implementations, at the very least I can't remember it's done by LDK or CLN.\r\n\r\n`lnd` will attempt to sweep all 3 possible anchors (our local, remote commitment, remote pending commitment) here: https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/48a3d5633560d0f38c69e69b3a4bf520545c8590/contractcourt/channel_arbitrator.go#L1383-L1409. We'll continue to offer those sweeps into the central input aggregation sub-system (the Sweeper) until one of them is spent or the commitment transaction confirms by itself. Each anchor is offered with a discint [exclusive group](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/48a3d5633560d0f38c69e69b3a4bf520545c8590/contractcourt/channel_arbitrator.go#L1298-L1300) so they won't be batched in the same transaction (would ofc be invalid). \r\n\r\nToday configure a deadline based on the soonest expiring outgoing HTLC, and then will retarget based on _only_ that deadline (so continually request a 15 block conf or w/e). In the next release, we're planning on revamping this to be more directly aware of elapsed time, then using a fee bumping function to progressively increase the fee we offer until ultimate confirmation. \r\n\r\n> IIRC during the meeting, people said that LND (cc @Roasbeef) are the only ones who do batching?\r\n\r\nYes today we'll batch all inputs that need to be swept into a single mega transaction on a best effort basis. As a prep for some of these upcoming changes, we've started to abstract out the concept of [input aggregation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8422) so we're able to implement more flexible policies to allow the anchors to be swept by themselves. \r\n\r\nWith our next release, we also start to use `testmempoolaccept` before publishing to attempt to cut down on wasted publish attempts to due violating the RBF rules or otherwise.

      "body": "@roasbeef Thanks for commenting here.  It sounds like in the not-too-distant future, the LND project would be ok with the v3 transaction policy + sibling eviction plan that I've laid out above, as a replacement for CPFP carveout?\r\n\r\nJust to update this thread -- #28948 (with the v3 policy rules) was merged, but without v3 transactions being made standard yet (as we wanted to leave room for further feedback on whether the 1000 vbyte size limit on children is a reasonable number to pick).  At this point, in the absence of any such additional feedback, I think we should just leave it as-is and move on.\r\n\r\nSo as far as timeline/roadmap goes, I think if all goes well, then conceivably in the 28.0 release (~7 months from now) we will likely see in Bitcoin Core:\r\n\r\n- v3 sibling eviction (#29306, this is almost ready for merge)\r\n- v3 transactions made standard (#29496)\r\n\r\nAnd my hope is that we may also have cluster mempool in that release (draft is in #28676 for concept purposes only), but that is a big project so whether that makes it in to 28.0 or some later release is unknowable right now.\r\n\r\nWhenever we get to the point that we are ready to merge cluster mempool, the question will be whether the LN folks want the \"imbued v3\" behavior merged as well, so that LN commitment transactions pick up the v3 semantics without explicit changes to the transactions.  I think the advantage of doing so would be that rollout of cluster mempool could happen without first having to deploy v3 as standard for a release or two (to let the network upgrade so that v3 transactions will propagate), because old software would relay nVersion=2 LN commitment transactions and apply the existing carveout rule, while new software would give the v3 semantics (limited child size/topology, plus sibling eviction) to ensure that fee bumping CPFP's of commitment transactions will be relayed, with limited pinning potential by an adversarial counterparty.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the imbued v3 patch is of course a giant hack and has downstream impact on LN wallets, the LN maintainers whose applications would be affected should explicitly ACK that idea before we consider merging it.  A draft PR that shows what the code could look like is in #29427.\r\n\r\nOf course there's also a very good chance that getting cluster mempool finished and reviewed in time for 28.0 is too ambitious, in which case we could always revisit the timeline and decide whether imbued v3 would be needed for a smooth rollout, or if LN will opt-in to the v3 rules explicitly before cluster mempool would be deployed.",

A draft PR that shows what the code could look like is in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29427.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of merging hacky, temporary code into bitcoin core to be honest. Since LN implementations are not _fully_ leveraging the carve-out rule anyway (because we can end up in a state where our mempool contains our _local_ commitment transaction, but our peers have the _remote_ commitment transaction with a chain of descendants to pin it, in which case we have no way of broadcasting our spend of the anchor output on the _remote_ transaction), we're already exposed to that risk today. We can't easily fix that without package relay anyway, so we can just accept the fact that this stays somewhat broken until we start using package relay? And thus we don't really need the hacky v3 imbuing logic?",
