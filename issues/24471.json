    "title": "Make all RPCs take a blockhash argument / allow rpc leasing?",
    "body": "One thing I heard interviewing some users is that it's very common to sequence RPCs with periodic tip hash checks and restart if a new block comes in.\r\n\r\nSomething that might be helpful would be if Core could support a few different things in RPCs:\r\n\r\n1) a tip hash argument that causes failure if the passed_tip != actual_tip\r\n2) a hash argument that causes failure if the passed_tip \\not \\in header_chain\r\n\r\nanother thing that might help these types of users could be node leases whereby:\r\n\r\n1) the node is given a lease which expires e.g. N seconds after the lease is granted/no message has been sent by the leasor, and the node will not process new messages until the lease is free or let go\r\n\r\nOptionally, we could allow a distinct non expiring lease.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne might use such an API like (made up RPCs)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nfinished = false\r\nwhile not finished:\r\n    try:\r\n        h <- getbestblockhash\r\n        b <- getwalletbalance h\r\n        a <- getnewaddress h\r\n        send b a\r\n        finished = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nL <- get_lease\r\nb <- getwalletbalance h\r\na <- getnewaddress h\r\nsend b a\r\nclear_lease L\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nLeasing might be better than just a blockhash argument because you can guarantee e.g. repeated calls to mempool operations are consistent. This could be problematic e.g. if a txn is in the mempool and you're trying to coordinate wallet software to detect txns paying you so that you might fee bump them with CPFP, it might disappear while your flow of txns is occuring.",

      "body": "> The RPC calls that come to my mind that would have this problem are `listunspent` and `listtransactions`. (If there's a way to ask `listunspent` and `listtransactions` to ignore the mempool, I'm not aware of it).\r\n\r\nIt's the wallet that would have to ignore the mempool, I think that could be done. A wallet could be loaded but be \"disconnected\" from the mempool and the chain. In this case, the wallet RPC's should return the latest block processed by the wallet. However, I think the wallet should be \"readonly\" (like watchonly) and all spend calls should fail. The GUI would have to be aware of this as well.\r\n\r\nI understand leases/locks can simplify sync on the client-side. However, I don't think it's that great because:\r\n - if bitcoind is shared then one client can block the others\r\n - if a client crashes its locks/leases could be dangling resulting in an unusable bitcoind\r\n - the client would still have to handle re-sync after some time and/or some notifications, ideally not from scratch\r\n\r\nThe following are what I consider good tips for sync methods:\r\n - be idempotent, re-processing the same data (block/tx/notification) should not result in more changes in the client state, this helps incremental syncs\r\n - listen for zmq notifications on startup and use them to increment or invalidate some client state\r\n - batch process, for instance, avoid listing all transactions",
