I have tried to compile this thing but each time I try to do so, there is a new issue. For reference I am using Ubuntu Bash terminal to compile Bitcoin. My operating system is Windows 11 and I have tried everything I know to troubleshoot this issue. I have downloaded clang, mingw g++ and I will attach the a photo to explain this issue. Each time I try to use the ./configure, ./autogen.sh and sudo make, there seems to be issues and this will not compile at all. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you! PS. I have also created a virtual environment and I have installed the necessary tools for it as well. \r\n![Bitcoin Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42873006/169974755-3155d988-6051-426b-b339-d0a7a326a9d4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- What behavior did you expect? --> I expected the Bitcoin Core to compile.\r\n\r\n<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? --> \r\n\r\n<!--- How reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? --> The version of Bitcoin core is version 23.0 I have forked it from the bitcoin GitHub Bitcoin page.\r\n\r\n<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? --> I am using an ASUS X555Y series Laptop.\r\n\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue?
