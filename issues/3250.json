          "body": "Using change addresses cause a lot of problems, and don't have much benefit. The problems:\n- High learning curve - newbies don't know where their money is going. When they make a payment, they see their entire address drained of money on the blockchain.\n- Backing up your bitcoins becomes almost impossible. This is really the biggest problem with using change addresses, and it is a HUGE problem. How do you back up your money if your addresses are drained every time you use them? If you want to back up an address, you can do that easily. Just encrypt your wallet and copy it to various devices (your phone, external HD, USB drive, paper wallet, etc). If change addresses are used tho, you must copy to all your backups (as painful as printing out a new paper wallet) every time you make a transactions. That is intractable.\n\nThat intractability I think is a HUGE problem for bitcoins. People need a simple, understandable secure way of being \"their own bank\" and change addresses make bitcoins broken for most people.\n\nYou can use seeded address generators, and back up the seed. But there are no standard algorithms for doing that. If you find your seed in 30 years, how will you know what algorithm to use to use the seed on? You'd have to back up the algorithm with your seed. That's really hard on paper. \n\nIts in the best interests of bitcoin and bitcoins users to have a simple way to back up their money. It doesn't make sense to make backing up bitcoins far more complicated just to gain a little bit of privacy, especially when the technique [probably doesn't even work](http://anonymity-in-bitcoin.blogspot.com/2011/07/bitcoin-is-not-anonymous.html). Don't gear this currency toward power user - let power users use advanced features when they understand them.\n",

      "body": "Laanwj is right with regards to backup: Anyone who has worked at IT support will know that the absolute majority of people does not do any backup at all. \nFurther, I would like to add the aspect of security: Most computers of average users are infected by malware, if not almost all. This has not yet become a huge threat for Bitcoin, but it will because by nature, Bitcoin is easy to steal. In fact Bitcoin might even become the primary target of the whole botnet market: Without Bitcoin, to earn money you needed to find someone shady to buy all the computing power which you were stealing with your malware - probably rather difficult to find someone who pays for something this illegal. Now you can monetize directly by stealing Bitcoins and using the machines for mining. Bitcoin is as promising for malware authors as it is for honorable use :(\nAnd deterministic wallets are the foundation for watch-only / paper wallets, so they will help security very much. Therefore, if I'm allowed to I would also vote for this being high priority.\n",

The official / first / most popular / primary implementation and because of its most users most tested software usually is usually the choice of people who want to go down the secure path.\n\nAnd with Bitcoin, security is something which has much higher demand than with other software, so its even more important to have a nice primary implementation.\n",

Users will not know what your internal considerations are. Users will know \"it's called Bitcoin\", that the official site is \"bitcoin.org\", and that \"Bitcoin Core\" is developed by bitcoin.org. Users will assume what the official site publishes is the most well-tested, stable software. \n\nOr to explain it from a different point of view:\nI have over 3000 packages on my system. If I want the most rock-solid, stable experience, why on earth would I decide not to go for the most widespread, seeming-to-be-official version of each? It's impossible to randomly determine for 3000 packages whether a third party re-implementation is deemed to be more stable.\n\nPlease don't give up providing a trustworthy reference implementation.\nAFAIK, there isn't even a Bitcoin wallet with deterministic builds other than Bitcoin core yet.\nThe only other thing which people say to be high security is Bitcoin Armory, and **for over 1 year** they failed to process my bug report about their source code compilation instructions providing **completely broken GnuPG validation**\nhttps://github.com/etotheipi/BitcoinArmory/issues/91\n(the issue _still_ applies: https://bitcoinarmory.com/building-from-source/)\n\nYou're still the best :)\n",

If we can download 6GB movies over iTunes and play CPU/GPU intensive 3D games we can also run a full node (pruned) on a standard computer. It's just a matter of user-friendliness (by throttling bandwidth and cpu usage).\n\nAt the moment it's _experimental_, thought, you can use it in parallel to the existing wallet.\nMain features:\n- Multiwallet support (**implemented**)\n- Flexible RPC parameterizing (**implemented**)\n- HD wallets with support for multiple bip32 chains per wallet (**implemented**)\n- Append only filestore, separated files for private keys and wtx/pubkey (**implemented**)\n- HDM (in progress)\n",
