On Linux a build with ccache finishes in a few minutes. On Windows it takes almost an hour, even with clcache. clcache apparently had no effect on the build time and has been removed in #18640 \r\n\r\nIf someone has background in Windows build systems, they could help us speed up the build or even enable the functional tests again.\r\n\r\nMaybe the issue is with appveyor, so an option could be to port the appveyor yaml to travis or cirrus ci and see if that fixes the problem.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nExperience with Windows powershell and Windows build systems\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this.

      "body": "I was just looking at this issue, and it seems that the historical context was actually to _remove_ HTTP `keep-alive` header (behind a flag) in 16a5c18cea7330bd68dc9d2f768eb518af88795b due to long-lived connection issues, and then finally erase it completely in the RPC overhaul of 40b556d3742a1f65d67e2d4c760d0b13fe8be5b7.\r\n\r\nI am therefore wondering, would the aim of this issue be to re-introduce `keep-alive` again (behind a flag, defaulted to `off`) which could be used by the test framework, or to try and find an alternative approach?",
