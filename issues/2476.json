    "title": "no separate source code tarball download available",
    "body": "on http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.8.1/\nthere's no source code tarball which i need to get reproducible results on my build-it-yourself distro (package management system is laid out for source tarballs with checksums, not git checkouts)\n\napparently the linux download has the source included, but also comes with prebuilt binaries (unusable in my case, since i use a different libc).\nthis bloats up the tarball to twice the needed size or more, which affects download time and hd usage.\n\nthe argument that 18 MB is nothing compared to 7G of blockdata, is not valid for people who just fetch all tarballs in one go (so they have them already in case they need it), but in the end do not use the bitcoin client.\n\nthe other argument that github provides downloads is also <b>not valid</b>, since\n1) they generate tarballs on the fly so the checksum changes whenever it is removed from cache (gz uses a random seed, so every archive produced is unique, even with the same content)\n2) github redirects from http to http<b>s</b>, making it impossible to download anything with busybox' wget program. they did not even reply to my complaints about that.\n3) github has no redundancy, when the frontend server(s) is down, everything is down\n4) SF.net (which is already used for binary downloads) has at least 20 mirrors in different countries, and provides much better download speeds. additionally it lets the user choose if he wants HTTP or HTTPS downloads.\n\nso please in the future release a separate source code tarball and make it available from the default download page.\nthanks.\n\nplease also consider using the .xz compressor since it's about 40-60% better in compression and only slightly slower in decompression speed than .gz (but 3-4x as fast as bz2) and available on any linux distribution that came out in the last 5 years. even busybox supports it by default.\n",

I know that you are asking for something that some additional work on an already strained release process that seemingly almost no one else cares about, on the basis of apparently incorrect claims (github's tag links being non-determinstic), with additional preconditions which we will not commit to supporting (non-ssl downloads).\n\nDo you think that responding aggressively and arguing every point is going to get you your way here?  I might have made a commitment to do some extra work to support someone's particular requirements— if I understood them and thought it would help— but I'm certainly not inclined after this interaction. :(\n\nAs far as Jeff goes, he hasn't said why one of the two options we already have isn't sufficient for his usage.\n",

(Interestingly: the one it changed to is completely invisible to me: nothing in the reflog on my checkouts with that hash. Nothing in the github UI, etc.)\n\nEdit: I've decoded what appears to have happened in robbak's case: Originally he created the port using the ID of the ultimate commit on that version, but we subsequently added the digitally signed tag as part of the release process. The path in the tarball uses the ID of the tag (94933c3) instead of the commit.\n",
