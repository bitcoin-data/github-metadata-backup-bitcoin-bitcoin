    "body": "Bitcoin Core has 3 algorithms for coin selection. All of them are executed and then, the result with the 'best' waste metric is chosen. Thinking about privacy, the user could prefer a solution that doesn't generate change (of course, users that want privacy usually prefer choose the coins manually). Anyway, what if the user could choose to prioritize the solution given by BnB? So, in the case of BnB finds a solution, the other algorithms would not need to be executed. ",

      "body": "I agree with any kind of configuration options related to coin selection\r\n\r\nLast time we discussed this in a different issue and below are different arguments FOR and AGAINST it:\r\n\r\n> Maybe: coinselection=1 for privacy, coinselection=2 for fees, coinselection=3 for dust and by default it will work as its working right now\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20598#issuecomment-740941693\r\n\r\n> Providing so much additional information to users generally makes a bad user experience, especially for users who don't know how transactions and transaction fees work. I don't think it would be good to do be suggesting alternatives and telling users to study all this other stuff. The point of having a software manage UTXOs and make transactions is to abstract all of that away from the user. You end with with decision paralysis or users choosing some \"obvious\" thing without understanding the nuance. I'm certain that if you presented the option for users to have a \"prefer lower fees\" coin selection, the vast majority of users would pick that and not realize that doing so will create a degenerate wallet in the long run.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20598#issuecomment-740970966\r\n\r\n> I think in the future it might make sense to offer different coin selection algorithms, because the one-size-fits-all doesn't really fit everyone. An algorithm that selects the least amount of input coins to reach the target (for a high feerate tx) could make sense in a wallet that regularly consolidates the change-spam with lower feerates.\r\n\r\n> Obviously, there is always the possibility to implement coin selection externally, but not all users of Bitcoin Core might have the expertise to do so.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20598#issuecomment-741581541\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> But I think we can use the priority since the algorithms can change and most user don't know their name.\r\n\r\n@brunoerg I have reviewed few coin selection related PRs, read few posts, tried reproducing lot of issues, experimenting and still don't know what all algorithms are used for coin selection by Bitcoin Core and how do they work. Since my priority is mostly privacy for personal transactions I prefer to use coin control and none of the coin selection algorithms however such algorithms can be useful for others especially exchanges. Sometimes even power users make mistakes so algorithms and saved configuration can help them.",

So, BnB can find a solution with 10 inputs and SRD finds one with 3 inputs but generating change, if the solution provided by SRD is more economic than the BnB one, it will be choose. However, I may not want the most economic, what if I want the solution that doesn't generate change (for privacy reason)? I don't think the users should know how the algorithms work, but it would be great if he could choose a strategy. Of course, those who wanna 100% privacy will choose the coins manually, but in some cases not everyone has this possibility.\r\n\r\nThanks for posting here that other issue, I am reading it..",

          "body": "As per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25560, I suggested that new maintainers should be added with a call for maintainer process as outlined below.\r\n\r\n> \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)  by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\r\n if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\r\n role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\r\n maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\r\n relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\r\n\r\nThe doc has not been adopted. However, bitcoin is a permissionless project, so I am opening a C4M that is just of my own personal initiative.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Do we need a new scoped maintainer?\r\n\r\nFrom IRC on August 12th, 2022, where @laanwj also stepped down:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<bytes1440000> I see a need for \"janitorial maintainer\" who understands the importance of privacy in core and privacy of contributors. Since #25560 is still open and intent of reviewers doesn't look they want to improve anything in the process, there is no \"call for maintainers\" thing.\r\n<bytes1440000> I would prefer someone who has already contributed to bitcoin privacy and privacy in general, not living in first world countries and not funded by brink.\r\n<vasild> #proposedmeetingtopic vasild for a new maintainer with a focus on P2P/networking \r\n<vasild> I volunteer, if there is a perceived need for that.\r\n<bytes1440000> vasild: thanks for volunteering and i think you are the best candidate for p2p/privacy. I wish we had one for mempool/privacy and wallet/privacy as well.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Today's IRC Meeting, August 18th 2022. For the sake of the new process, please consider that ACKs here are ACKs on the person but are included here as demonstrating ACKs on the need for such a new maintainer & the role. Note also that vasild is not explicitly stating privacy, as bytes1440000 requested initially, which has been clarified below in this discussion to be out-of-scope for this proposed maintainer. (Please see the complete logs for all discussion, this is not a full excerpy).\r\n\r\n```\r\n<vasild_> Two maintainers stepped down recently (sipa and laanwj) and there is no dedicated maintainer for P2P/networking. So I step in coz I think I can help the project in that way. That's it.\r\n<laanwj> i think it would make some sense, you've been the most active in P2P development for quite a while\r\n<jarolrod> concept ack, i think vasild_ is very qualified for such a role. And has contributed important changes to the p2p code. He also has done extensive reviews, and catching issues others don't catch\r\n<michaelfolkson> +1\r\n<hebasto> concept ack\r\n<achow101> ack\r\n<lightlike> ack vasild\r\n<jonatack> a thought: the past few years vasild, laanwj, and myself have been working on or reviewing a large-ish chunk of net code that few others have been. i believe sipa knows the code well, too, along with (maybe) a couple others. laanwj has been merging these changes. so it makes sense to me that one of these would maintain.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Relevant Evamples of PRs such a maintainer might focus on\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25421\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25717\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25688\r\n\r\nwhich includes things that impact privacy in P2P\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19860\r\n\r\nBut does not include non P2P/Networking Privacy code like:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23372\r\n\r\n## Nominees\r\n\r\nI will keep this synced with nominees from the below thread / other maintainers feel free to edit to keep synchronized.  Feel free to self nominate. As per #25560, nomination period + Q&A is \"open\" for 2 weeks, after which a decision may be made if desired.\r\n\r\nCurrent Nominees:\r\n\r\n- @vasild (nomination accepted, self)\r\n- @jonatack (nomination acceptance pending)",
