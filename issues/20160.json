    "title": "Proposed Timeline for Legacy Wallet and BDB removal",
    "body": "What to review next: #30328 \n\n***\n\nHere is a proposed timeline for the move from legacy wallets to descriptor wallets, and at the same time, bdb to sqlite, culminating with the removal of both legacy wallets and bdb. Even though the wallet type and the wallet storage format are orthogonal to each other, as noted in #19077, I would like to tie them together for the sake of simplicity when it comes to how we make new wallets and the migration of one type to another.\n\nThe 4 combinations of type and format are: legacy-bdb, legacy-sqlite, descriptor-bdb, and descriptor-sqlite. While all 4 types will be supported, we will primarily deal with legacy-bdb and descriptor-sqlite. Setting `descriptors=True` in `createwallet` (or checking the Descriptors option in the GUI) will always make a descriptor-sqlite. Setting that to `False` will always make a legacy-bdb.\n\n- [x] 0.21 (late 2020)\n  - [x] Initial release of descriptor type and sqlite format. (#16528, #19077)\n  - [x] Descriptor type is experimental with a warning as such (#16528)\n  - [x] Only legacy-bdb and descriptor-sqlite will be created (#19077)\n- [x] 22.0 (mid 2021)\n  - [x] Implement descriptor exports (#20226)\n  - [x] Legacy type remains default (no pr needed)\n  - [x] Introduce `dump` and `createfromdump` wallet tool commands with an additional `-format` option to specify the wallet type (#19137)\n    * Users may use `dump` and then `createfromdump` in order to make legacy-sqlite from legacy-bdb\n    * Users may use `dump` and then `createfromdump` in order to make descriptor-bdb from descriptor-sqlite\n  - [x] If a wallet specified in conf or command line doesn't exist, don't make a wallet and instead warn (#15454)\n- [x] 23.0 (early 2022)\n  - [x] Change descriptor type to non-experimental (#23002)\n  - [x] Change `createwallet` `descriptors` default to `True` (#23002)\n  - [x] Change wallet tool `create` `-descriptors` default to `True` (#23002)\n- [x] 24.0 (late 2022)\n  - [x] Introduce `migratewallet` command to migrate a legacy-bdb to descriptor-sqlite (#19602)\n  - [x] For newly created legacy-bdb wallets, warn that they are deprecated and will soon be unsupported (#24505)\n- [x] 26.0 (late 2023)\n  - [x] When loading legacy-bdb, descriptor-bdb, or legacy-sqlite wallets, warn that the legacy type and bdb format will soon be unsupported, as applicable. (#27869)\n  - [x] Deprecate creating new legacy-bdb wallets #28597 \n  - [x] `migratewallet` bug fixes\n    - [x] #28609\n    - [x] #28546\n- [x] 27.0 (early 2024)\n  - [x] address book performance improvement #26836\n  - [x] bulk deletion of txs performance improvement #28987\n  - [x] bulk deletion of records performance improvement #29403\n  - [x] Caching to improve performance of migrated non-HD descriptor wallets (also perf improvement in general) #26008\n  - [x] Remove `migratewallet` experimental warning #28037 \n- [ ] 28.0 (late 2024)\n  - [ ] Improve performance of migratewallet #28574\n  - [x] Reimplement legacy-bdb to descriptor-sqlite migration (maybe as a separate command or in the wallet tool) to be independent of `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` and BDB (#26596)\n  - [x] For `dump`, implement an independent BDB file loader (this should probably be shared with the previous) (#26606)\n  - [ ] GUI: Migrate wallets that are not loaded (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/824)\n  - [x] Fix default wallet migration naming (#29586)\n  - [ ] Fix `listwalletdir` of migrated default wallets and generated backups (#30265)\n  - [ ] Remove `IsMine` from migration (#30328)\n- [ ] 29.0 (early 2025)\n  - [ ] Stop loading legacy-bdb, descriptor-bdb, legacy-sqlite wallet entirely. Inform users how to migrate (#28710)\n  - [ ] Remove `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` except for the independent migration stuff (#28710)\n  - [ ] Remove BDB except for independent loading for migration stuff (#28710)\n\nAdditional improvements that have no target deadline:\n\n- [x] Backwards compatibility tests fixes for descriptor wallets #28027\n\nThe migration code will probably be around for a long time/forever.\n\nNote that we expect users who go through the effort to make a legacy-sqlite or descriptor-bdb wallet to suck it up and deal with the consequences of doing something that isn't really supported. Such users should be able to figure out for themselves how to migrate their wallets. (Maybe `migratewallet` can migrate legacy-sqlite to descriptor-sqlite. bdb to sqlite is way easier than legacy to descriptor).",

You already need regular backups of non-HD wallets anyway, needing a one-time new backup after migration to HD doesn't seem too big of a deal to me. As said above, I do prefer a few more years before forcing people to migrate, but if one accepts that a migration is going to happen, I don't see the problem with restricting it to use HD key derivation. If one is concerned about the specifics of BIP32's unhardened derivation, it should be possible to choose hardened derivation descriptors instead, or by then some other deterministic key derivation mechanism may be supported by descriptors.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> I find the proposed timeline in general somewhat aggressive here, and would prefer to let old wallets to just keep working for a few years longer. Historically speaking, we've never dropped support for an old wallet format, and how frequently I see reports of people trying to access old wallets, I fear this will worsen it.\r\n\r\nAgree. Also everything doesn't work with descriptor wallets. \r\n\r\nExample: I have used legacy wallets in this [proof of concept](https://github.com/1440000bytes/p2p) which will be used to build a p2p exchange",

      "body": "#26596 (draft) allows users to migrate a legacy wallet without the need for BDB. There are some (corruption) scenario's it can't handle. For that users would have to download an old version of Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nRecent versions contain a separate `bitcoin-wallet` binary, which means they don't have to run a potentially outdated Bitcoin Core node just to migrate their wallet. We'd have to make sure that standalone tool is feature complete enough. I don't have much experience with fixing corrupt wallets. See #13044 for things that might be missing (e.g. only available as an bitcoind RPC call or startup argument).\r\n\r\nIn addition we'd need a way to migrate a non-hd legacy wallet (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20160#issuecomment-1244759508). IIUC in particular we need it to _not_ generate a fresh HD seed in that case. And maybe benchmark the performance to see if the use of individual SKPM's is acceptable, and if not, design a new one that can have multiple keys. Such ancient wallets may be a very small number of users, but probably not very small amounts of BTC. It makes sense to make any migration for them as limited as possible (they can create a fresh wallet and move coins over when they feel comfortable). In particular this deprecation should not be a barrier to upgrade their node.\r\n\r\nHaving a read-only BDB wallet (which #26596 enables) could be useful for such users too. It lets them see the coins are still there.\r\n\r\nThat removes any objections I have about dropping BDB from the codebase and dependencies entirely. However, not too soon. We can probably wait until the ancient 2010 code becomes a problem for (using) modern compilers. As long as building from source and running (most of) the test suite doesn't require BDB, it's not a huge burden to keep it around a while longer.",
