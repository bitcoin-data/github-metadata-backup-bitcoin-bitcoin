      "body": "Seconded. I have been using Bitcoin for a couple of days, and while many users will not care about the details, I want to know (at least during my initial testing of the system) exactly how it works. This will help me, and other tech-savvy users understand the security implications.\n\nTo me, the biggest \"black box\" of the whole system is the wallet. It's a binary blob which I am told to keep backed up or else. It's unclear to me how I would restore it without erasing recent transactions. I'm not sure which data is stored in it and which is not -- from the look of some other bugs here, it seems to store more data than just the public/private keys (such as config data). Does it store the names I have associated with the addresses? (I wouldn't want to lose my PC, restore my wallet.dat, and discover I can't tell who sent me what, so I'd hope it does store those names.) Does it store sending addresses? (I don't think it should, as that's more of an address book than a crucial wallet.) And it isn't encrypted with a password.\n\nI'm not asking for answers to these questions -- I can find them out if I really want to. I'm saying that these answers should be immediately obvious from inspecting the wallet file. There should be nothing \"magical\" about this file, for an advanced user.\n\nI would like to see a transition to a \"Wallet 2.0\" file format, which is simply a PGP-encrypted text file (so, binary, but a simple gpg -d will get the text out). I should be able to encrypt it with either a symmetric or public key.\n\nInside the file, there would be a simple ASCII format, such as:\n&lt;address&gt; (active|inactive) [name] &lt;pub-key&gt; &lt;priv-key&gt;\n\nwith one address per line (or split into \"sections\" if the pub-key and priv-key are too long to put on a single line). The active|inactive determines whether the address shows up as a receive address in the GUI (so when it pre-generates 100 addresses, they all show up here, and are all marked inactive until the user presses \"New Address\" in the UI).\n\nThis would only contain receiving addresses. Sending addresses would be in a separate address book file, which would hopefully also be a text file, and I could back up too if I wanted to but isn't critical.\n\nNow, at a glance, I (as a technical user) can tell exactly what data is stored in the wallet. And it should be significantly easier to write tools for listing all the money associated with each account in the wallet, splitting up a wallet into separate files, and so on.\n",

      "body": "There has been some discussion relating to a so-called \".bitkeys\" format, which would be a standardised human-readable text file format for storing Bitcoin private key data. It seems to have been suggested here by [mike]:\n[http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3638.40](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3638.40)\n\nI don't know if the format discussion has moved elsewhere, but you should try to be compatible with this format.\n\nBasically, this means your file should start with v=1 (version, I assume). Exporter should write v=1, importer should check for v=1.\n\nOtherwise, what you suggest is almost right, but the private key and block number should be comma-separated:\nbase58 encoded privkey,block number  # comment\n\nEverything after the hash is a comment. You said it was \"optional\" but that sort of implies that your software will possibly be looking for an address and available BTC. It should not, since the format should allow arbitrary machine-ignored text after the #. So your exporter should write # [address] [available BTC] or whatever you want, but your importer should completely ignore everything after the comment and just use the privatekey to derive the public key and address.\n\nAlso note, if you haven't written the code for this already, that I already implemented, in C using OpenSSL, the code to take a 32-byte private key and generate the full 279-byte DER key (which Bitcoin internally calls the \"private key\") and 65-byte public key. My intention was for my code to eventually be used inside Bitcoin itself, so please use it if you can:\n- [bitcoin-import Bazaar branch](https://code.launchpad.net/~mgiuca/+junk/bitcoin-import)\n- [priv_der.c](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mgiuca/+junk/bitcoin-import/view/head:/priv_der.c)\n\nIt is currently a command-line program which takes the private key as input and produces the DER key (of which the public key is a substring), but it is very well documented and could easily be adapted into a bitkeys file reader.\n",

The code for importing and exporting private keys also already exists, see http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=3906. The hard part is keeping the data structures in bitcoind intact and up to date when importing things.\n\nThe precise formatting is only a detail that can easily be changed. Clearly, the importer will ignore everything after a #, as the address and available BTC to an address can be derived from the private key and the block chain, but still useful for human readers, so the exporter will put them in comments.\n\nMaybe we should start the format discussion again, since there are additional useful things to put in such a file, it seems.

If I don't, I precondition 'higher and lower are reversed' in AbstractBlockChain#getPartialChain\n\nAgain, recreating a new blockstore works but you always end up having to sync back to the last checkpoint even though you have all the block headers since then in the SPVBlockStore. This is a bit inefficient.\n\nThe code in the MultiBit mb-0.5-bcj-v0.8 branch is what I am working on.\n",

          "body": "I've run bitcoin-qt Mac client on the latest OSX version since 0.3.x thru to 0.7.2 with literally zero problems ever, on essentially this same hardware setup.\n\nSince the 0.8 update and switch to LevelDB none of the three Mac client releases have worked stably for me and I've had to downgrade to 0.7.2 (with the May 15 workaround) to maintain a stable bitcoin wallet.\n\nCurrent setup is: MacBook Pro Retina, OSX 10.8.4, bitcoin-qt 0.8.2\n\nI saw that some of the known corruption issues/bugs were fixed/closed with the 0.8.2 release, so I decided to try the upgrade again.  After re-indexing and working fine for hours at time (much better than 0.8.1 at least) upon restart I get \"Error opening block database. Do you want to rebuild the block database?\" which of course I don't want to do because it takes forever, even on this world's fastest Mac with SSD drive.  This has happened 6 times now, and the interesting line in debug.log is:\n\nVerifying last 288 blocks at level 3\nLevelDB read failure: Corruption: block checksum mismatch\n\nMore details here:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155140.0\n\nDowngrading to 0.7.2 again, please help permanently fix this in the next 0.8.x release.\n",

Transport independence. Bitcoind should not throw 500 http error on every exception. It's only for crashed code.\nFor example, there is no Java JSON-RPC lib that provide sufficient support for hadling 500 http error. So, if you develop Java service that uses Bitcoind - you are not able to work with custom Bitcoind exceptions. (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/bitcoinrpc.h)\nOtherwise you either have to write from scratch or modify existing library, what generally is not easy. Moreover, nobody except you will support this lib for JSON-RPC 1.0\n2. Reduced fields. Some libraries throw an error if the fields \"error\" and \"result\" are found together - it's true for JSON-RPC 1.0, but wrong for 2.0\n3. named parameters\n\nFull support of 2.0 is preferable.\n\nP.S. In recent days, I'm implementing a Java service that uses Bitcoind - guys, this is hell. The current interface is not suitable for real-world applications that deal with money. I don't understand why version 1.0 instead of 2.0 was choosen...\n",

          "title": "[soft fork] Block v3: miner commitments with compact proofs",
          "body": "There are proposals in the pipeline, and some currently deployed applications which require commitments of special forms of data to the blockchain by miners. For example, merged mining requires each block to have a data commitment at a single deterministically identifiable position. UTXO hash-tree commitments adds the root hash of a Merkle tree of the current validation state at a similarly known or identifiable position such that clients using such an index structure can acquire UTXO proofs with SPV security. Compact SPV proofs require commitments of a Merkle heap or skip list structure of past block headers, for the purpose of constructing traversals through the block headers with logarithmic scaling in space. All of these miner-commitment applications require to varying degrees three essential properties:\n1. _A unique or identifiable place within the block where the commitment is to be placed_. For a given commitment type the miner must know where to put the commitment into a block template, someone using it must know where to find it within a block or its Merkle proof (the transaction containing the commitment, the path to the transaction through the Merkle tree of the block, and the block header).\n2. _Impossible for a miner to create multiple block commitments of the same type within the context of a single block_. A user given just the transaction containing the commitment, its path through the Merkle tree, and the block header must have confidence that the commitment is of the indicated type, and the only one of that type in the block.\n3. _Compact commitment proofs_. The transaction containing the commitment should contain no more information than is necessary to uniquely identify the commitment type and the commitment itself, so as to minimize the size of commitment Merkle proofs. Achieving this property directly benefits protocols built on top of data commitments.\n\nThe only extant example of miner commited data in Bitcoin Core is BIP 34, which add the block height to the coinbase string in order to ensure coinbase transaction uniqueness. Higher level protocols such as p2pool and namecoin's merged mining also require commitments via the coinbase transaction. However such schemes fail to meet one or more of the properties above, especially the requirement for compact commitment proofs: coinbase transactions can be unreasonably large due to mining pool payout schedules and the increasing amount of data being stuffed in the coinbase string.\n\nAn alternative is to use transactions of a special form, and a separate transaction for each commitment. These commitment transactions have a single input whose scriptSig consists of a single data push, the contents of which is the commitment type:\n\n```\nscriptPubKey: <type> OP_EQUAL\nscriptSig:    <type>\n```\n\nThe outputs of the transaction are available for prune-able OP_RETURN data commitments. In order to meet requirement #1 and #2, a soft-fork validation rule is added such that any block containing two such special-form transactions with the same commitment type is rejected, and the anyone-can-spend outputs of the form `<type> OP_EQUAL` must be present for each required commitment, in order to provide an output to be spent COINBASE_MATURITY blocks later. It is suggested that one data commitment be set aside for the purpose of document timestamping, merged mining, and other applications which do not need additional validation rules. This patchset sets aside the `OP_0` commitment type for this purpose.\n",

It's his work, I've just integrated it into our build-system.\nThis was done in a few stages:\n- Add libtool dependency. I've tried to update all relevant docs, but very possible I missed some. Note that we don't actually make real use of libtool yet, it's only used when linking the subproject.\n- Pull in libsecp256k1 subtree\n- Add configure option \"--enable-libsecp256k1\". This is disabled by default.\n- Update the makefiles to link against the lib where necessary\n- Finally, add in the actual implementation.\n",

          "body": "Hello,\n\nI'm Evan Duffield, the lead developer of Darkcoin. We recently re-forked from Bitcoin 0.9.3 away from litecoin and after which we had a minor network fork, with 2 valid chains for a period of time. This lead many clients getting segfaults, after hitting this line of code:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.10/src/main.cpp#L1274\n\nI've looked through updates done to Bitcoin since 0.9.3 and this looks like an unknown issue in the Bitcoin codebase. This is important and must get fixed, because a good portion of the network is on vulnerable versions and my understanding is they'll all segfault when a fork condition is met. \n\nHere's the stack trace from Darkcoin.\n\ndarkcoind 0.11.0.11\n\n(gdb) bt\n#0  0x000000000046a83e in ToString (this=<error reading variable: Cannot access memory at address 0x0>) at uint256.h:343\n#1  CheckForkWarningConditions () at main.cpp:1749\n#2  0x000000000047e3d5 in AddToBlockIndex (block=..., state=..., pos=...) at main.cpp:2734\n#3  0x000000000047e9d0 in AcceptBlock (block=..., state=..., dbp=dbp@entry=0x0) at main.cpp:3065\n#4  0x000000000047f991 in ProcessBlock (state=..., pfrom=pfrom@entry=0xb6ed40, pblock=pblock@entry=0x7fffdeffc460, dbp=dbp@entry=0x0) at main.cpp:3184\n#5  0x000000000048475f in ProcessMessage (pfrom=pfrom@entry=0xb6ed40, strCommand=..., vRecv=...) at main.cpp:4468\n#6  0x0000000000486b53 in ProcessMessages (pfrom=0xb6ed40) at main.cpp:4780\n#7  0x000000000050a71f in operator() (a0=<optimized out>, this=<optimized out>) at /usr/include/boost/function/function_template.hpp:760\n#8  m_invoke (connectionBody=..., this=0x7fffdeffca60) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:368\n#9  operator() (connectionBody=..., this=0x7fffdeffca60) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:345\n#10 dereference (this=<synthetic pointer>) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/slot_call_iterator.hpp:82\n#11 dereference<boost::signals2::detail::slot_call_iterator_t<boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool(CNode*)>, boost::function<bool(const boost::signals2::connection&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::slot_invoker, std::_List_iterator<boost::shared_ptr<boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > >, boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > > (f=<synthetic pointer>) at /usr/include/boost/iterator/iterator_facade.hpp:517\n#12 operator\\* (this=<synthetic pointer>) at /usr/include/boost/iterator/iterator_facade.hpp:643\n#13 operator()<boost::signals2::detail::slot_call_iterator_t<boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool(CNode*)>, boost::function<bool(const boost::signals2::connection&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::slot_invoker, std::_List_iterator<boost::shared_ptr<boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > >, boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > > (first=..., this=<optimized out>, last=...) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/optional_last_value.hpp:34\n#14 operator()boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool, boost::signals2::detail::slot_call_iterator_t<boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool(CNode*)>, boost::function<bool(const boost::signals2::connection&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::slot_invoker, std::_List_iterator<boost::shared_ptr<boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > >, boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > > (first=..., this=<optimized out>, combiner=..., last=...) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/result_type_wrapper.hpp:53\n#15 boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool (CNode*)>, boost::function<bool (boost::signals2::connection const&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::operator()(CNode*) (this=<optimized out>, arg1=arg1@entry=0xb6ed40) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:246\n#16 0x00000000004f0155 in operator() (arg1=0xb6ed40, this=0xb240d8) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:695\n#17 ThreadMessageHandler () at net.cpp:1529\n#18 0x00000000004f7bee in TraceThread<void (*)()> (name=0x74f2d1 \"msghand\", func=0x4effa0 <ThreadMessageHandler()>) at util.h:575\n#19 0x00007ffff7f55629 in ??

          "title": "Add autoprune functionality",
          "body": "Continuing the work of @rdponticelli, this is an implementation of the autoprune functionality (see #4701).  Thanks to @rdponticelli for doing a lot of prior work on this topic; we used his work and the discussion of it as our starting point (though we found it easier to base this pull off of master).  @mrbandrews, @morcos, @ajweiss, and @sdaftuar collaborated on this pull.  \n\nTo summarize autoprune: this adds a -prune=N option to bitcoind, which if set to N>0 will enable autoprune.  When autopruning is enabled, block and undo files will be deleted to try to keep total space used by those files to below the prune target (N, in MB) specified by the user, subject to some constraints:\n- The last 288 blocks on the main chain are always kept (MIN_BLOCKS_TO_KEEP),\n- N must be at least 550MB (chosen as a value for the target that could reasonably be met, with some assumptions about block sizes, orphan rates, etc; see comment in main.h),\n- No blocks are pruned until chainActive is at least 100,000 blocks long (on mainnet; defined separately for mainnet, testnet, and regtest in chainparams as nAutopruneAfterHeight).\n\nWe’ve attempted to address the comments raised in the prior conversations; here are a few things worth noting:\n1.  Handling reorgs greater than the data stored on disk is not yet implemented.  Currently, bitcoind will exit with a message indicating that it failed to read the block on disk -- suggestions for a better error message are welcome.\n2.  We’ve disabled block relay (with a check to see if we’re NODE_NETWORK or not).  In the future when we have worked out the service bit to use for an autopruned node and the behavior for block requests, we can re-enable this appropriately.  (This differs from the behavior of #4701 .)\n3.  PruneOneBlockFile currently iterates mapBlockIndex each time to determine which entries to update; we can optimize this by maintaining a reverse lookup table so that the blocks in each blockfile are known.  \n4.  One open question is what to do if we’ve pruned before, and then are running a -reindex: what do we do with the leftover files?  In this case, the first N files will have been deleted by the pruning code, which won’t be processed in the reindex loop, but later we may try overwriting the remaining files in place.  Would it be better to, say, delete the files preemptively to prevent potential file corruption? \n5.  RPC/REST interfaces currently do not distinguish between unknown blocks/tx and pruned blocks/tx.  It's unclear if a specific error should be returned, or perhaps the block/tx query interfaces be disabled for pruned nodes.\n6. Tests and a test plan will be forthcoming.\n\n(Though this pull still needs more work to address some of the above items, we thought we'd open it now to keep review momentum on this feature moving...)\n",

This preserves the \"first seen\" behavior of the mempool, in the sense that a transaction will never be replaced in a fashion that prevents an address from receiving funds that it otherwise would have. In short, zero-conf transactions are unaffected. (beyond the usual breakage for any mempool behavior change)\n\nTo prevent replacements from being used as a DoS attack mechanism a replacement only happens if the new transaction has a higher fee, pays a higher fee/KB rate, and the fee increase is sufficient to pay for the bandwidth consumed in relaying the replacement.\n\nIncludes stand-alone unittests for regtest in qa/replace-by-fee/ (implemented w/ python-bitcoinlib as I've been asked for a backport of this to v0.10/v0.9)\n\nYou can easily try out the behavior using https://github.com/petertodd/replace-by-fee-tools bump-fee.py with the -s first-seen-safe mode switch.\n\nCC: @aalness @coblee re: https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/pull/3\n",

The maximum correction speed is equal to doubling or halving the fee per two hours. The relay fee will never go below the -minrelayfee setting. It is not intended to deal with sudden spikes - that's what the hard cap is meant for.\n\nThis was inspired by Jeff Garzik's low/high water mark approach, but has more gradual effects.\n\nTODO: integration with fee estimation. @morcos, feel like having a look at that?\n",

There are lots of details in both the BIP and the discussion on the bitcoin-dev ML.\n\nThere are still some TODOs in the code here, but I do not think they are blockers for this, as they are not protocol-level changes and can be implemented separately to make the protocol more effecient.\n",

Result would be those txids being added to recentRejects, messing up propagation.\n\nThat said, I haven't actually tested this yet; about to go off to a conference, so if someone else wants to confirm for me that'd be much appreciated! Or if I'm wrong you're welcome to all laugh at my expense. :)\n\nCC: @sdaftuar @sipa \n",

Before these changes the GUI could sometimes send a transaction with a recently set payTxFee and not respect the settings displayed in the GUI.   After these changes, using the GUI does not involve the global transaction confirm target or payTxFee.\r\n\r\nThe prospective fee displays in the smart fee slider and the coin control dialog are changed to use the fee calculation from GetMinimumFee, this simplifies the code and makes them slightly more correct in edge cases.\r\n\r\nMaxing the fee calculation with the mempool min fee is move from estimateSmartFee to GetMinimumFee.\r\n\r\nThis fixes a long standing bug, and should be tagged for 0.15 as it is holding up finalizing the estimatesmartfee RPC API before release.\r\n",

This issue is reproducible across versions, have tried all the way down to version 0.9.0 & witnessing the same assertion failure.\r\n\r\nUsing tools: TileGx, Linux (3.4.61), GCC / G++ 4.9.2, Libboost 1.64.0.\r\n\r\nBelieve, the dependency environment is prepared with correct versions ( Ref: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dependencies.md ). The issue seems to be due to a combination of CPU (tilegx), GCC libraries.

This PR aims to improve privacy dramatically while preserving the benefits of rebroadcasting that ensure txns are successfully propagated through the network.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces changes so nodes will resend transactions that it believes should have already been mined. It extracts the logic from the wallet into the mempool, so nodes will rebroadcast txns regardless of the originating wallet. Txns are defined as \"should have been mined\" by using the block assembler logic, and excluding txns that were recently added to the mempool. The wallet will resubmit txns to the mempool on a regular cadence to ensure those txns aren't dropped (due to eviction, expiry, etc..) before being confirmed. \r\n\r\nFor more information, see: https://gist.github.com/amitiuttarwar/b592ee410e1f02ac0d44fcbed4621dba",

This is work-in-progress meant to gauge interest, related to but not dependent on [#16110](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16110), i.e. one can run the \"mobile\" GUI on desktop as well. You should install `qtdeclarative5-dev` and `qtquickcontrols2-5-dev` in addition to usual Qt dependencies and configure with `--enable-mobile-gui`.\r\n\r\nAs a proof-of-concept this PR aims to be light, about 400 lines of C++ code that is meant to be a drop-in replacement for `bitcoingui` with mostly the same public functions and a couple of #ifdefs in `bitcoin.cpp`. There is also an addition of `roleNames` to the `transactiontablemodel` to make it compatible with QML stuff.\r\n\r\nReplacement class `bitcoinmobilegui` hooks up to the exact same signals, models and controllers as `bitcoingui`. At the moment the mobile GUI presented to the user is dead simple (no multi-wallet, no advanced options) but it has been tested to allow the user to send and receive.\r\n\r\nMy rationale for making this is the fact that in a couple years phones will be powerful enough to run Core without much hassle. If we add some platform code for \r\n\r\n- verifying transactions only while in foreground or charging (to preserve battery)\r\n- enabling phone to phone transactions (NFC or bluetooth for enhanced privacy)\r\n- providing services to other local apps (think Lightning wallets, they could get the blockchain state from Core, no wasting of resources)\r\n\r\nand release an official Android package I believe that this has the potential to put a full node in the pockets of millions - empowering users and improving the network.",

So in particular, block transfer times to this new node were very quick.\r\n\r\nWhat was unusual was that even though this machine fast, it was getting disconnected repeatedly during IBD for stalling (it would then get readded, since addnode'd it).  I started to look through my debug log to see what was going on, and it appears to me that it may have been something like this:\r\n\r\n- Some other peer X is stalling, gets disconnected.\r\n- Connect to some new peer Y.\r\n- X's blocks get assigned to other peers, maybe the local one.\r\n- If we're near the end of the download window, then because Y is available not downloading any blocks, the peer that was reassigned X's block has 1 second (?) to provide the block, or else that peer is stalling.\r\n\r\nSo it looked to me like I'd go through periods of time where everyone was getting disconnected for stalling, such as this particularly egregious example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:52 UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000003085d45701cef706396618d68bea4b9551b7442b031d1863 height=313019 version=0x00000002 log2_work=79.946856 tx=43453816 date='2014-07-29 15:40:42' progress=0.218633 cache\r\n=1581.8MiB(3793192tx)\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:54 Peer=290 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:56 Peer=282 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:08:58 Peer=291 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:06 Peer=292 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:08 Peer=286 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:11 Peer=293 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:15 Peer=294 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:17 Peer=295 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:19 Peer=296 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:21 Peer=297 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:23 Peer=298 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:28 Peer=299 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:30 Peer=300 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:32 Peer=301 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:35 Peer=302 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:37 Peer=303 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:39 Peer=304 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:41 Peer=305 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:43 Peer=306 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:45 Peer=307 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:48 Peer=309 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:51 Peer=310 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:53 Peer=311 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:55 Peer=312 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:57 Peer=313 is stalling block download, disconnecting\r\n2016-11-22 13:09:59 UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000001291028bceab2639c12c762be3988017cba99fa792b460c4 height=313020 version=0x00000002 log2_work=79.946955 tx=43454953 date='2014-07-29 15:45:18' progress=0.218647 cache=1581.8MiB(3793020tx)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: forgot to mention that the above snippet is from me grepping for \"stalling|UpdateTip\" in my debug.log, so the new connections that happened in between those stalling messages aren't shown.",

          "body": "When RBF was originally implemented in #6871, the mempool did not keep track of ancestor scores yet. It was pointed out that ancestor scores would be the most accurate metric, and [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6871#discussion_r43031583) to temporarily \"Require that any new inputs that show up in the replacing transaction be already confirmed. In the future, if we do merge something like ancestor package tracking and better mining code, we could update this...\"\r\n\r\n#7594 added ancestor tracking to the mempool. It enables mempool validation and mining code to directly access a mempool entry's ancestor score (total modified fees divided by total vsize for the transaction and all of its mempool ancestors). As such, we now have the ability to do what was desired originally.\r\n\r\nThis PR does 2 things:\r\n\r\n(1) When evaluating a transaction for RBF, requires the replacement transaction to have a higher ancestor score than that of each original transaction. This boils down to \"the replacement transaction is a better candidate for mining (by feerate) than all of the transactions it would replace.\"\r\n\r\n(2) Removes enforcement of BIP125 Rule #2, allowing replacement transactions to spend unconfirmed inputs not spent by the original transactions.",
