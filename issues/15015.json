The results are variable and it's hard for me to have confidence in them. When all is snappy and well, I am not seeing a difference. When the GUI is laggy/scanning, the PR does seem better, but it's hard to say. I built and compared both several times, back and forth.**\r\n\r\nThe test was to load several wallets, 2-3 small wallets and then one large 177MB wallet, and run various console commands like getbalances, getwalletinfo, listwallets, etc. The large wallet is a regtest one generated with @achow101's [make-big-wallet.py](https://gist.github.com/achow101/f24309bba501cc08c9a3a3d55fa6eec6) script. \r\n\r\nOn both Debian and MacOS it takes the GUI 5-6 minutes to load the big wallet.\r\n\r\n![gui-big-wallet-loading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2415484/77901255-d1cc0800-726e-11ea-9567-05084242b0aa.jpg)\r\n\r\nOnce loaded, the GUI ran fine in my tests, with an additional reaction latency of ~400-500 ms with console commands like getbalances or getwalletinfo when the commands were run on big wallet. The other commands, and clicking on and opening transactions, ran basically as fast as they do with tiny wallets.\r\n\r\nWith one build on Debian, I did see the GUI halt, and then crash with segmentation faults, when loading any wallet at all. However, rebuilding after make clean solved that, so I suspect it was the build.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has suggestions on how to best instrument this or for further tests to run with the big wallet, let me know.\r\n",
