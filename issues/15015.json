At some point things went sideways and i had to shutdown my asset explorer.\r\nI have tried to setup a new node on Ubuntu Server 18.04.1 LTS with Ravend 2.2.0.0. When fully synced, the node would be available for either a few minutes or hours until it became unresponsive, again. At other times the node became unresponsive after just a few RPC calls (getblockchaininfo) and would experience high CPU en memory usage.\r\nI am currently setting up a new node with Ubuntu Server 18.04.1 LTS and Ravend 2.1.3.0. Will give an update in the next few days.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nSome links from BTC's Github:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15148\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15015",

Fix this by early checking if cache is dirty or not.\r\n\r\nThe actual balance computation can still hang the GUI thread but that is tracked in #16874 and should be fixed with a solution similar to #17135.",

The results are variable and it's hard for me to have confidence in them. When all is snappy and well, I am not seeing a difference. When the GUI is laggy/scanning, the PR does seem better, but it's hard to say. I built and compared both several times, back and forth.**\r\n\r\nThe test was to load several wallets, 2-3 small wallets and then one large 177MB wallet, and run various console commands like getbalances, getwalletinfo, listwallets, etc. The large wallet is a regtest one generated with @achow101's [make-big-wallet.py](https://gist.github.com/achow101/f24309bba501cc08c9a3a3d55fa6eec6) script. \r\n\r\nOn both Debian and MacOS it takes the GUI 5-6 minutes to load the big wallet.\r\n\r\n![gui-big-wallet-loading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2415484/77901255-d1cc0800-726e-11ea-9567-05084242b0aa.jpg)\r\n\r\nOnce loaded, the GUI ran fine in my tests, with an additional reaction latency of ~400-500 ms with console commands like getbalances or getwalletinfo when the commands were run on big wallet. The other commands, and clicking on and opening transactions, ran basically as fast as they do with tiny wallets.\r\n\r\nWith one build on Debian, I did see the GUI halt, and then crash with segmentation faults, when loading any wallet at all. However, rebuilding after make clean solved that, so I suspect it was the build.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has suggestions on how to best instrument this or for further tests to run with the big wallet, let me know.\r\n",

          "body": "Main commit `gui: Avoid wallet tryGetBalances calls` is one-line change to `WalletModel::pollBalanceChanged` that returns early if there hasn't been a new `TransactionChanged` or `BlockTip` notification since the previous poll call. This is the same behavior that was implemented in #18160, now implemented in a simpler way.\r\n\r\nThe other commits are a straight revert of #18160, and two tweaks to avoid relying on `WalletModel::m_client_model` lifetime which were causing travis failures with earlier versions of this PR.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change is to be able to revert #18160 and cut down on unnecessary cross-process calls that happen when #18160 is combined with #10102\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).",
