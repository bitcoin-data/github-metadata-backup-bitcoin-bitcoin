    "title": "listsinceblock incorrectly showing some conflicted transactions",
    "body": "Normally when a transaction is conflicted, listsinceblock will show it as having negative confirmations, representing how long ago it conflicted. However, looking at the results of my listsinceblock shows dozens of conflicted transactions with 0 confirmations (as well as transactions whos parents have long been forgotten by the network).\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"account\": \"\",\r\n  \"address\": \"1AM7qmzyzkZecxn5hTPUCbBbog3r3YbVyE\",\r\n  \"category\": \"receive\",\r\n  \"amount\": 0.00684870,\r\n  \"label\": \"\",\r\n  \"vout\": 0,\r\n  \"confirmations\": 0,\r\n  \"trusted\": false,\r\n  \"txid\": \"f108f58235e35f3eb07d24d9d330f6098234137dd505bbd19ff249d809254f2d\",\r\n  \"walletconflicts\": [\r\n  ],\r\n  \"time\": 1493696422,\r\n  \"timereceived\": 1493696422,\r\n  \"bip125-replaceable\": \"unknown\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich would make you think it's a pending receive, so lets dive deeper:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli gettransaction f108f58235e35f3eb07d24d9d330f6098234137dd505bbd19ff249d809254f2d\r\n{\r\n  ....\r\n  \"hex\": \"0100000001975c0acaefcc4abc471c5d9fe8de6ee5d6e76e7f01a089466f0a73c5f23dc36c000000006b48304502210088baffcff66ade8770a802888c868071291be4f6c6b7427e9938dbf2c9df6ee6022028a9a1af3e7e0ef4cdf42b3b6cc3113787e4db29922c1b90e182b2f1665be83e012102efdaa4cbd4fb4edd41978403a4343786462fefa514f98cbe1894f7053a1216c2ffffffff0146730a00000000001976a9146687296e39b87666fcbff34738c984eca686451e88ac00000000\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDecoding that, you'll see it's sourcing:\r\n    ```{ \"txid\": \"6cc33df2c5730a6f4689a0017f6ee7d6e56edee89f5d1c47bc4accefca0a5c97\", \"vout\": 0 }```\r\n\r\nWhich is a transaction that has not confirmed, nor in my nodes mempool. Fortunately we can find it on [tradeblock](https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/tx/6cc33df2c5730a6f4689a0017f6ee7d6e56edee89f5d1c47bc4accefca0a5c97\r\n), and see it's conflicted with dd0ab2618d4df044d369b56ce96f6f8d9dca6e04f4c180fa73e8ace20b3653e3 which has long confirmed.\r\n\r\nSo this means that our original transaction is just sitting in listsinceblock is actually conflicted and impossible to ever confirm, yet not marked as such.",

So in this case the API response is identical to \"you have a pending receive\"  but the reality is the transaction is orphaned and it's now impossible for it to ever confirm. This is a distinction worth making.\r\n\r\n(FWIW, I don't care too much about this issue as I don't use `listsinceblock` as despite having the perfect API for me -- it's pretty much unusuable due to bugs/quirks/bad-behavior/etc. This issue was an attempt at documenting some of the problems I found, but I think it might just be better to deprecate the whole command)",

Right now it's pretty wtf, and you can't tell if it's intentional or not. Like the `blockhash` filter doesn't even work for conflicted transactions (at least when I tried a year ago)",
