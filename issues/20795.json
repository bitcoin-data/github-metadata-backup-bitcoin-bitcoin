    "body": "I am relaying a privacy issue for Bitcoin Core that was [reported on r/Bitcoin](https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/klk2wh) (Reddit).\r\n\r\nThe [message](https://pastebin.com/raw/ptFQityt) was:\r\n\r\n- _Using coin control_\r\n- _Custom change address_\r\n\r\n_When one clicks the increase transaction fee button, it adds another input rather than increasing the fee by reducing the change output. Major privacy leak since you have no control of the input used._\r\n\r\nFrom that it sounds like the observed behavior is that the replacement transaction includes an additional UTXO that was not chosen by the user, even though the transaction was composed as a Coin Control transaction.\r\n\r\nSo I'm assuming the expected behavior would be for Bitcoin Core to remember that this OUTPUT was actually a Custom Change Address and to then lower the amount of that OUTPUT by the amount needed for the fee bump.\r\n\r\nAnd, now that I am thinking of this, isn't there the expectation that if my initial transaction was done using Coin Control, and then if my fee bump (RBF) needs another UTXO input to cover the increase in fee, that Coin Selection for that will occur (regardless of whether or not the change address was a Custom Change Address)?

It happens only when using custom change address for initial transaction which was RBF enabled and coin control features were used. \r\n\r\nCan we include a warning when replacement transaction is being confirmed? Something like \"_Different inputs might be selected for replacement transaction since custom change address was used earlier_\"\r\n\r\nOr we need to fix something else related to coin selection algorithm being used for replacement transaction?",

I tested it and below are the results: \r\n\r\n1. New change address created with `getrawchangeaddress`: tb1qqt7w0m00xkth4ugsymw93t74ugkdey6c6g57k9\r\n\r\nUsed for a RBF transaction and replacement transaction had no extra inputs/outputs: https://tbtc.bitaps.com/f7b6c65165e4f7fbce11c8e3426deb207b55dd5b599c8a3e36b30169060421b6\r\n\r\nNo issues. Maybe because change addresses follow  `m/0'/1'/i'` derivation path in bitcoin core wallet.\r\n\r\n2. Labelled the same change address with: `setlabel \"tb1qqt7w0m00xkth4ugsymw93t74ugkdey6c6g57k9\" \"label1\"` and used in a transaction. \r\n\r\nUsed for a RBF transaction and replacement transaction had extra inputs/outputs: https://tbtc.bitaps.com/17f3208ecb34c6c14574de53e73b1039215bed9f67bc4606771c5b032e51d0bf\r\n\r\n3. Created a new 'change address' and labelled it with: `setlabel \"tb1qd4ld5clqv0maky0l9fqr38ck4qr605jx0xqezd\" \"label2\"`\r\n\r\nUsed for a RBF transaction and replacement transaction had extra inputs/outputs: https://tbtc.bitaps.com/9d2d0960d06d09b630ad7e2599d0a608247f548e6f7b91d891bef459229e01af\r\n\r\n>  When a change address is added to the 'address book' Core no longer recognizes it as a change address and so doesn't know that it can be reduced when bumping the fee.\r\n\r\nInteresting. It should still be a 'change address' maybe not recognized as change address to improve privacy (address re-use).\r\n\r\n> Producing a warning when bumping a fee is about to throw away your privacy is a step in the right direction but it would be nice if there was an option to bump a fee without throwing away your privacy.\r\n\r\nAgree. I need to do more tests and this issue is interesting for two reasons: 1. Privacy and Fees can be improved while using Bitcoin Core Wallet 2. I will learn a lot during the research\r\n",
