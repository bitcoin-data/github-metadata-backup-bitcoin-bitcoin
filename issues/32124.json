Whereas this issue is about loading (?) a corrupt (?) sqlite wallet, without steps to reproduce. Also, it is unclear how the two sqlite errors interact and if the second one is due to another dangling process on the system, or not.\n\nSo my recommendation would be to add exact steps to reproduce, similar to #32111.",
