    "body": "Unless we don't have any.\n\nOne of the goals of p2p traffic encryption was to make it impossible for passive observers to figure out where a transaction originates. However as long as there's enough unencrypted connections remaining, that doesn't seem very effective.\n\nAssuming v2 transport adoption has reached an acceptable level, it may be a good time to start preferring it more strongly.\n\nSpecifically I would suggest that we only relay transactions to v2 peers.\n\nIf a v1 peer asks for a transaction, we should probably just give it to them. I suspect it's break of backward compatibility if we don't?\n\nWe probably also want to continue receiving transactions from such peers, so we can't just pretend to be blocksonly.",

      "body": "I agree with @mzumsande above, also:\n\nIf a node has even a single v2 connection that already makes it nearly impossible for a passive spying ISP to conclude it is the origin of a transaction, no?\n\nLets assume a node has only v1 connections, then the ISP can observe all transactions going to it and all transactions going out of it. As soon as a transaction is seen going out that did not come in, a conclusion can be made that it originated from the node.\n\nHowever, if there are v2 connections, even just a single one, then the spy has no way to know. If they see an outgoing transaction for the first time, they cannot know whether the node is the origin or whether the transaction came from outside via the v2 connection and the node is just relaying it.",
