    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nPreface: This whole analysis was made using Elements Core, not Bitcoin Core, but the code and the conditions should line up in a way that makes this likely in Bitcoin too.\r\n\r\nThere's an assert crash in `assert(chain_depth >= 0); // coinbase tx should not be conflicted` calling `CWallet::GetTxBlocksToMaturity` because `CWallet::GetTxDepthInMainChain`  returns a negative value for `TxStateConfirmed` txs. The reason for this is that `m_last_block_processed` is set at the beginning of `AttachChain`, but the rescan loop keeps going beyond that point, so when `GetTxDepthInMainChain` is called right after the scan is done, m_last_block_processed is lower than the actual block in the latest txs, hence returning a negative value and crashing.\r\n\r\nIn discussions with @achow101 , it's possible that https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30221 fixes this issue by calling `SetBestBlock` after the rescan is done. Another approach could be to stop the scan when `m_last_block_processed` is reached with something like this\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n@@ -1689,6 +1693,11 @@ CWallet::ScanResult CWallet::ScanForWalletTransactions(const uint256& start_bloc\r\n         if (max_height && block_height >= *max_height) {\r\n             break;\r\n         }\r\n+        if (block_height >= GetLastBlockHeight()) {\r\n+            WalletLogPrintf(\"Stopping scan.

Create a chain with many coinbase txs.\r\n2. Attach a wallet (could be read only) with the address of the coinbase txs\r\n3. While the wallet is still being loaded, create many more blocks with coinbase txs to that address\r\n4. Assert happens when the wallet is done loading\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nmaster@62bd61de110b057cbfd6e31e4d0b727d93119c72\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nFedora 41\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
