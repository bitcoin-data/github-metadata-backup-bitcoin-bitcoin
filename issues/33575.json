    "title": "RFC: Cancelling waitNext calls in the IPC mining interface",
    "body": "It seems that the IPC mining interface needs to provide some way to cancel [`BlockTemplate::waitNext`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b510893d00760083ac36948747aa6ebd84656192/src/interfaces/mining.h#L63-L74) calls. This should not be hard to implement, but there are a few approaches that could be taken and it would be useful to know which would work best for callers. Context:\n\n---\n\n _Originally posted by @plebhash in [#33554](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33554#issuecomment-3381673850)_:\n\n> the thing is, I still need to cater for incoming Sv2 `CoinbaseOutputConstraints` messages, and whenever that arrives, I need to make sure the `BlockTemplate` (or `TemplateIpcClient` as I'm aliasing on the rust code) that's used to kickstart the next `waitNext` loops has the correct `block_reserved_weight` and `max_additional_sigops` as defined on the Sv2 message.\n\n---\n\nDifferent ways I could think of doing this:\n\n1. Have `BlockTemplate` destructor cancel the `waitNext` call and have it return null right away.\n2. Add a new `BlockTemplate::interruptWait()` to be able to interrupt `waitNext()` without destroying the template.\n3. Make `Mining::createNewBlock()` cancel any pending `waitNext()` calls.\n4. Use Cap'n Proto's cancellation mechanism. Rust code could just drop the waitNext() promise. C++ `waitNext()` method could have a new `interfaces::Cancel` argument that would let it ask if the request was cancelled and/or register a cancellation callback.\n\nIf main use-cases for cancelling waitNext methods are when needing to specify changed `BlockCreateOptions`, and when shutting down, approach (1) could be sufficient, because in both of these cases the client will be discarding the `BlockTemplate` anyway.\n\nBut maybe a new `BlockTemplate::interruptWait()` method (2) could be useful for other reasons and we should add that method too?\n\nApproach (3) making other IPC calls implicitly cancel pending waitNext() calls, seems like it could make mining interface more annoying to use, so I think it is probably not a good idea, but wanted to mention it as an alternative.\n\nApproach (4) could be interesting, and would be the most general approach but would be more work than other approaches to implement. (The implementation would need to modify the `mp.Context` [`PassField`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/blob/a4f92969649018ca70f949a09148bccfeaecd99a/include/mp/type-context.h#L57) implementation to call `Promise::attach` on the promise it returns to be notified when the promise is discarded, as described https://capnproto.org/cxxrpc.html#cancellation and https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/blob/v2/kjdoc/tour.md#cancellation)",

      "body": "Good catch: [createNewBlock](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b510893d00760083ac36948747aa6ebd84656192/src/ipc/capnp/mining.capnp#L20C5-L20C19) (and checkBlock below it) really should take an `mp.Context` parameter. Without it, it's impossible to specify a worker thread for the calls to run on, so the calls wiill block the event loop thread while they execute, potentially affecting other calls and clients. This looks like another thing that should be fixed. But fixing it is more-or-less independent from implementing option 3. The `createNewBlock` implementation could be changed to cancel prior `waitNext` calls without needing to add a `context` parameter.\n\nI was a little surprised that from your perspective there might be significant difference between options 2 and 3. But maybe from your second comment the difference is not too significant. Option 2 should just require an extra `block.interruptWait()` call before the `mining.createNewBlock()` call. I should probably try to understand the rust client code and your description above a little better though. I'd think if the rust code is asynchronous, there should only be a single loop, and no need to break and spawn a new loop to handle waitNext responses. I would expect something like following very rough pseudocode:\n\n```python\nblock = None\nnext_block = mining.createNewBlock(create_options)\nsv2_msg = sv2_recv()\nwhile True:\n    done = await wait([next_block, sv2_msg])\n\n    if next_block in done:\n        block = (await next_block).result\n        sv2_send(block)\n        next_block = block.waitNext(threadmap.makeThread().result)\n\n    if sv2_msg in done:\n        msg = await sv2_msg\n        sv2_msg = sv2_recv()\n\n        if msg.type == \"coinbase_constraints\":\n            create_options.sigops = msg.sigops\n            if block: block.interruptWait()\n            next_block = mining.createNewBlock(create_options)\n        elif msg.type == \"found_solution\":\n             mining.submitSolution(...)\n```\n\nHopefully this is not too far off base.\n\nI guess next steps here would be to implement options 1 and 2. It's good to know option 4 has some appeal too, because that could be a followup, but it's would be relatively complicated to implement on the server side at the moment.",

But I could imagine rust code not letting the promise lifetime be managed as flexibly. Also I could image there being benefits to having two loops like maybe making it easier to write code that doesn't await unnecessarily. I'm sure using two loops make sense, it's just not what I might have expected naively.",

      "body": "hmm thinking about it deeper, I guess I could simply save the `waitNext` future into a `mut` variable so it's still available across the unified loop iterations, and then replace it whenever it either returns or is cancelled (via `interruptWait`) due to `CoinbaseOutputConstraints`\n\nso I wouldn't say your original gut feeling is totally wrong!\n\nalthough I still appreciate the benefits of separating concerns into different loops... I guess I'll experiment with both approaches whenever `interruptWait` becomes available and see which one leads to the best overall result vs tradeoffs\n\nbut bottom line is that options 2, 3 and 4 are all perfectly viable solutions for our needs!",
