      "body": "Given that computing the actual output script in a transaction paying to a silent payments address requires knowing the exact inputs and having the private keys for those inputs, I don't think this will really be possible in an ergonomic way, and any way to implement this is very footgun-y. The taproot address is entirely dependent on the inputs used so the receiver does not necessarily know that they have been paid if you just send to any taproot address computed from a silent payments address. This can potentially result in loss of funds.",
