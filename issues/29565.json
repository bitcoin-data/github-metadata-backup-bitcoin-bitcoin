    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-cli rollback`\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n\r\n1. height or hash\r\n2. delete blocks from storage\r\n3. delete headers\r\n\r\nThis should be used with networking turned off. As soon as you connect to a peer, it will sync back to the tip as normal.\r\n\r\nIt should rollback indexes too.\r\n\r\nIt should probably warn users if they have a wallet loaded, especially if the rollback is more than 10 (?) block; that's the point where the rollback process stops placing transactions back into the mempool.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\nWe currently rely on `invalidateblock` to roll back the chain to an arbitrary height. And then `reconsiderblock` to go back to the tip. Rolling back the chain is used when creating snapshots for assume utxo.\r\n\r\nThis works but the RPC methods are not designed for this. It has annoying side-effects like disconnecting peers because they have \"invalid\" blocks. If there are stale blocks near the height you want to roll back to, you have to make sure to invalidate those too. IIRC there's also no way to abort the process.\r\n\r\nFor functional tests it can be useful to forget a block and a header, e.g. to test behavior when a header is received multiple times from different peers, when receiving an unsolicited or mutated block. Currently such a test has to carefully sequence events, or use multiple unconnected nodes. This RPC would effectively add \"undo\" for such tests.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nStatus quo.\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nI'm not advocating to drop `invalidateblock` entirely. For example it's still useful if you want to fully validate a stale block.",

      "body": "@maflcko maybe \"clean\" in terms of code, but not in terms of behaviour. Our validation and p2p code behaves different when blocks are stored or headers are known. We also disconnect peers that send us \"invalid\" blocks. This is why the UTXO snapshot generation script has to turn off the network. But if anything goes wrong, you might end up with blocks marked invalid.\r\n\r\nIf we want e.g. 50 people to generate and attest their own snapshot, it seems quite likely that at least some of them will kill the node halfway because it takes too long. It seems safer to me if the node can recover from that with regular IBD behavior, and we don't have to tell users to call `getchaintips` and call `reconsiderblock` on various blocks.\r\n\r\nAlso, the only way at the moment to test if a given snapshot is valid, is to start a new node. With a `rollback` RPC you can test it on an existing node.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see if the code for such an RPC is _actually_ messy and complicated. Perhaps it can be done in a straight-forward way. I haven't tried (yet).",

Doing it purely in memory (as a cache) - as you suggested above - would have the advantage of making it safe and quick to abort.\r\n\r\nFor the use case of p2p test code (compact blocks, modified blocks, header spam, etc), you need to delete blocks and headers.\r\n\r\nI don't know a priori which approach is easier to implement.\r\n\r\n> in the unlikely case\r\n\r\nI agree it seems unlikely on mainnet, unless someone does it on purpose to frustrate the process. That could happen if we were to pick a predictable interval. That could be useful if we share (partial) snapshots via the p2p network, where nodes know in advance at which height the next snapshot will be.",
