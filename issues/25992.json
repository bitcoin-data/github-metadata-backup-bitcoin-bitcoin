    "body": "<!-- This issue tracker is only for technical issues related to Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nGeneral bitcoin questions and/or support requests are best directed to the Bitcoin StackExchange at https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com.\r\n\r\nFor reporting security issues, please read instructions at https://bitcoincore.org/en/contact/.\r\n\r\nIf the node is \"stuck\" during sync or giving \"block checksum mismatch\" errors, please ensure your hardware is stable by running memtest and observe CPU temperature with a load-test tool such as linpack before creating an issue! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the issue -->\r\n\r\nI was told to open an issue here. I've been having a really annoying issue with my bitcoin client that i cant find the solution to. Randomly, my bitcoin peer will start failing to send requests. At the same time, it pegs an entire thread, and it will stay that way until i intervene and restart it. I've tried everything, even using a different computer with the default config (other than `debug=1`). I can't seem to find anyone else having my issue, and nothing in my logs stands out to me. Something to note, when i did my test with the default config, i used bitcoin-qt to monitor, and it was still saying it was connected to 11 peers, although i couldnt add or remove any.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI expect my bitcoin node to stay up without me needing to intervene.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nMy node instead stalls and pegs a thread.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nI can reproduce it every time i start my client, although it will randomly occur within an observed 4hr-48hr window.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\n<!-- What version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->\r\nMain peer:\r\n- OS: EndeavourOS Linux x86_64 \r\n- Host: MacBookAir7,2 1.0 \r\n- Kernel: 5.19.1-zen1-1-zen \r\n- CPU: Intel i5-5350U @ 2.900GHz \r\n- Bitcoin Core v23.0.0 (self-compiled), used bitcoind\r\n- WM: none (headless)\r\n\r\nClean test peer:\r\n- OS: EndeavourOS Linux x86_64 \r\n- Host: MacBookPro16,2 1.0\r\n- Kernel: 5.18.16-arch1\r\n- CPU: Intel i5-1038NG7 @ 3.800GHz\r\n- Bitcoin Core v23.0.0 (downloaded from github releases), used bitcoin-qt\r\n- WM: i3\r\n- Graphical Shell: Kitty\r\n<!-- GUI-related issue?
