    "body": "Just trying to fork off the discussion from #3082. Seems like the is an interest for an RPC client with \"like tab completion, and inline help, and batch processing, and pipelines of queries, etc\"\n\nMy biased vote goes toward building it with Python, because there are plenty of existing libs for that. Would the script in contrib/bitrpc/ be a good start?\n\nOther questions involve feature set, and how to manage the executable. I've leave those for discussion though.  \n",

In contrast to a fully-fledged interactive shell (which would also be nice to have, see #3122), this can also be useful in scripts.\n\nSee https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7122#issuecomment-162578480 for discussion.\n",

          "body": "Implements #7442 by adding an option `-stdin` which reads additional arguments from standard in, one per line.\n\nFor example\n\n``` bash\n$ echo -e \"mysecretcode\\n120\" | src/bitcoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase\n$ echo -e \"walletpassphrase\\nmysecretcode\\n120\" | src/bitcoin-cli -stdin\n$ src/bitcoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase\nmysecretcode\n120\n^D\n```\n\nThis is the simplest implementation and avoids escaping issues by using newline as separator instead of space, I first had another implementation: https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin/commit/1f73b8e27b57c8561840cddc9f69a97475d06e85 that reuses `parseCommandLine` from the GUI debug console, but I think this is more useful in practice as most use of cli is probably script-driven.\n",
