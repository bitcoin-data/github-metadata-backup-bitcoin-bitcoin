    "title": "GUI unresponsive during slow operations",
    "body": "As mentioned https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/msg/83983170/, in Qt making slow or blocking calls in the event loop thread makes the user interface nonresponsive. Keyboard and mouse events are not processed and the display is not updated. There are different places in the code where this can happen, so this github issue is intended to be an umbrella issue to figure out a general strategy for turning synchronous calls into asynchronous ones and dealing with the problem.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nIn Qt, there are two different ways to keep the event thread responsive when handling an event that triggers an asynchronous operation:\r\n\r\n1. Return from the event handler right away after starting the operation (usually in some worker thread) so the main event loop can keep processing events.\r\n2. Run a [nested event loop](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qq/qq27-responsive-guis.html#waitinginalocaleventloop) in the event handling function in parallel with the asynchronous operation.\r\n\r\nApproach 1 requires using a using continuation style of programming that works best when an event only needs to trigger a single operation and UI update.\r\n\r\nApproach 2 can be more convenient when handling events that do more than trigger a single slow operation followed by a UI update. It can be a lot easier to implement than approach 1 in existing code, where separating all the slow operations from the ui updates could require rewriting control flow.\r\n\r\nApproach 2 doesn't work well when the user interface needs to support multiple async operations running in parallel. (For example if there are two buttons that both trigger async operations with nested event loops followed by UI updates, and you click the first button then the second button before the first operation completes, then the first ui update will be blocked until after the second nested loop exits even if the first operation completes first.)\r\n\r\n# Strategies for improvement\r\n\r\nGiven choices between returning to the main event loop or using nested loops, different strategies are possible for making slow synchronous operations asynchronous and making the GUI more responsive:\r\n\r\n1. Rewriting all blocking operations in the event thread in continuation style, never blocking in any event handler, and always returning immediately to the main event loop. This is pretty easy to do in new code, but would require rewriting a lot of existing code.\r\n\r\n2. Making a helper function using a nested event loop and a worker thread that would allow blocking code in event handlers to be easily replaced by asynchronous code, without having to change control flow. E.g. a `DoAsync` function that allows mechanically replacing code like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nResultType result = SomeSlowOperation();\r\nwidget->updateState(result);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n```\r\nResultType result = DoAsync([&]() { return SomeSlowOperation(); });\r\nwidget->updateState(result);\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Running nested event loops as part of the framework introduced by #10244, using the approach described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102#issuecomment-294094610. This would allow code in Qt that appears to be blocking just transparently handle events in the background.\r\n\r\nRegardless of which of the above strategies are used, it could make sense to use the #10244 refactoring as a starting point because it makes blocking calls in Qt code easy to identify (they all happen through m_node / m_wallet accesses), and in a few places it combines scattered operations into single calls.",

          "body": "This is a refactoring PR that does not change behavior in any way. This change:\r\n\r\n1. Creates abstract [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-local/src/interface/node.h) and [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-local/src/interface/wallet.h) interfaces in [`src/interface/`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc-local/src/interface)\r\n1. Updates Qt code to call the new interfaces. This largely consists of diffs of the form:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    InitLogging();\r\n-    InitParameterInteraction();\r\n+    node.initLogging();\r\n+    node.initParameterInteraction();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change allows followup PR #10102 (makes `bitcoin-qt` control `bitcoind` over an IPC socket) to work without any significant updates to Qt code. Additionally:\r\n\r\n* It provides a single place to describe the interface between GUI and daemon code.\r\n* It can make better GUI testing possible, because Node and Wallet objects have virtual methods that can be overloaded for mocking.\r\n* It can be used to help make the GUI more responsive (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10504)\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\n* I used python scripts [hide-globals.py](https://github.com/ryanofsky/home/blob/master/src/2017/hide-globals/hide-globals.py) and [replace-syms.py](https://github.com/ryanofsky/home/blob/master/src/2017/hide-globals/replace-syms.py) to identify all the places where Qt code was accessing libbitcoin global variables and calling functions accessing those global variables.\r\n* These changes were originally part of #10102.

Start bitcoin-qt with a very outdated blockchain state (mine was last updated with blocks from 2014 before switching to Bitcoin ABC). Maybe the bug also happens with a blank library state.\r\n2. Let the synchronization run for about 15-30 minutes.\r\n3. Attempt to use the GUI, which will be very slow, unresponsive and at times completely blocked.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nNo hangs should happen. No UI Coe should be blocked.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nUI hangs constantly, sometimes for a few seconds, and every 3-5 seconds.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots.\r\nScreen capture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqWliB0S3AY\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\nBitcoin ABC v0.14.6.0-a46e63c\r\n/Bitcoin ABC:0.14.6(EB8.0)/\r\nBerkeley DB 4.8.30: (April  9, 2010)\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: macOS Sierra 10.12.6\r\n- CPU: 3.3 GHz Intel Core i5\r\n- RAM: 24 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\r\n- Disk size: 2TB\r\n- Disk Type (HD/SDD): Fusion Drive (HDD+SSD)\r\n",

          "body": "This is a refactoring PR that does not change behavior in any way. This change:\r\n\r\n1. Creates abstract [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-local/src/interface/node.h) and [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-local/src/interface/wallet.h) interfaces in [`src/interface/`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc-local/src/interface)\r\n1. Updates Qt code to call the new interfaces. This largely consists of diffs of the form:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- InitLogging();\r\n- InitParameterInteraction();\r\n+ node.initLogging();\r\n+ node.initParameterInteraction();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change allows followup PR #10102 (makes `bitcoin-qt` control `bitcoind` over an IPC socket) to work without any significant updates to Qt code. Additionally:\r\n\r\n* It provides a single place to describe the interface between GUI and daemon code.\r\n* It can make better GUI testing possible, because Node and Wallet objects have virtual methods that can be overloaded for mocking.\r\n* It can be used to help make the GUI more responsive (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10504)\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\n* I used python scripts [hide-globals.py](https://github.com/ryanofsky/home/blob/master/src/2017/hide-globals/hide-globals.py) and [replace-syms.py](https://github.com/ryanofsky/home/blob/master/src/2017/hide-globals/replace-syms.py) to identify all the places where Qt code was accessing libbitcoin global variables and calling functions accessing those global variables.\r\n* These changes were originally part of #10102. Thanks to @JeremyRubin for the suggestion of splitting them out.",

I was aware of this back in the day, but was planning to fix it later. I never got around to it. Honestly speaking I don't think I ever will.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the event loop in the main thread of a Qt program (or any GUI program, for that matter) is never supposed to block. Any operation that can take non-trivial time (even in the order of 40ms) should be executed asynchronously.\r\n\r\nWe have many such cases; not only when the user does an explicit operation such as send, but also in response to internal notiications, and automatic periodic polls for new transactions, the current balance, and so on (these can take longer due to `cs_main` lock contention: worst during initial sync and when catching up). Also at the start of the application. Pretty much all communication with the node and wallet happens in the GUI thread itself.\r\n\r\nThis is more \"redesign\" than \"refactor\", anyhow, and definitely not a \"good first issue\" it needs to happen at some point. Even more if we want [snazzy animations in the android GUI](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16883).\r\n\r\n(ref #17112 and plenty of other \"GUI not responding\" issues)",

This causes unresponsive GUI if some commands are passed to the RPC console (#13217) before shutdown initiating.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- removes blocking call and uses additional signal-to-slot connections.\r\n- makes `bitcoin-qt` shutdown routine more streamlined: the only [`QApplication::exec()`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html#exec) is used in `bitcoin-qt`. Therefore, the main event loop never interrupts until shutdown, unlike master and alternative #13674.\r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n- #10504\r\n- #17145 \r\n\r\nThis PR is an alternative to #13674.\r\n\r\nFix #13217",
