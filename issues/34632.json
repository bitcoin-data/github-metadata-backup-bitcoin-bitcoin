    "title": "`listtransactions` does not list unconfirmed tx that spends only change outputs to a change address",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nI described this issue in a PR comment [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33671#issuecomment-3931638422), but @achow101 requested that I open a separate issue, stating that my problem is distinct from the one addressed by that PR.\n\nThe problem is that Bitcoin Core v30.2 has apparently forgotten about a transaction that I created, signed, and broadcast to consolidate some outputs. The outputs that I spent in the transaction are no longer listed by `listunspent`, but neither is the spending transaction listed by `listtransactions`. My transaction drew three inputs from a single wallet and sent one output back into that same wallet, but that unconfirmed incoming amount is not accounted for anywhere. `getbalance` and `getbalances` do not include the amount. Effectively, it looks as though I have simply lost money. I can retrieve the transaction by specifying its TxID to `gettransaction`, but the transaction does not appear in `listtransactions`.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n`listtransactions` should show all transactions involving addresses in the wallet, even if those transactions are unconfirmed, and even if they have been evicted from the local node's mempool.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Have three outputs, all sent to the same P2WPKH address. Mine were all sent in different transactions.\n2. Construct a transaction to consolidate the three outputs into a single output to that same address. (Yes, I know that broadcasting this transaction makes the address less quantum-resistant because its EC pubkey is now published.)\n    ```\n    $ bitcoin-tx -create in=a1b2…c3d4:0 in=b1c2…d3e4:2 in=c1d2…e3f4:1 outaddr=12.345:bc1q…etc\n    ```\n    **Note:** The amount specified in the `outaddr` argument is exactly the sum of the amounts of the three inputs.\n3. Calculate and deduct a minimal fee from the output.\n    ```\n    $ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"${wallet}\" fundrawtransaction \"${hex}\" '{\"add_inputs\":false,\"subtractFeeFromOutputs\":[0],\"fee_rate\":0.1}'\n    ```\n4. Sign the transaction using the wallet.\n    ```\n    $ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"${wallet}\" signrawtransactionwithwallet \"${hex}\"\n    ```\n5. Broadcast the signed transaction.\n    ```\n    $ bitcoin-cli sendrawtransaction \"${hex}\"\n    ```\n    **Note:** No `-rpcwallet=` argument was specified in this command.\n6. Somehow cause the transaction to be evicted from the local node's mempool.\n    ```\n    $ bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction \"${txid}\"\n    error code: -5\n    error message:\n    No such mempool transaction. Use -txindex or provide a block hash to enable blockchain transaction queries. Use gettransaction for wallet transactions.\n    ```\n7. Attempt to find the transaction in the output of `listtransactions`.\n    ```\n    $ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"${wallet}\" listtransactions '*' 10000 | jq --arg txid \"${txid}\" '.[] | select(.txid == $txid)'\n    ```\n    It's not there.\n8. Query the wallet's balance.\n    ```\n    $ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"${wallet}\" -named getbalance minconf=0 avoid_reuse=false\n    ```\n    The money is apparently missing!\n9. Query the wallet for the missing transaction.\n    ```\n    $ bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"${wallet}\" -named gettransaction txid=\"${txid}\" verbose=true\n    ```\n    The wallet indeed knows about the transaction and reports `\"confirmations\": 0`, yet the transaction is not accounted for anywhere.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\nThe node's `debug.log` does include a line `AddToWallet ${txid}  new InMempool` dated when the transaction was originally broadcast. It also includes another line, dated about 18½ hours later: `Submitting wtx ${txid} to mempool for relay`. There are no other mentions of the TxID in the log.\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv30.2\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nGentoo Linux\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nLinux 6.12.58-gentoo x86_64",

The transaction shows up as expected in `listtransactions`.\n\nHowever, `listtransactions` does do interpretation of transactions in order to make \"logical transactions\" to avoid confusing users with various Bitcoin internals (e.g. change, multiple inputs, etc.). This includes excluding outputs that the wallet things are change. If I send to a change address, then the transaction does not show up, and I think that's the only way to make that happen.\n\nHow did you get the address you sent to? What is the output of `getaddressinfo` for the output address?\n\n***\n\nWe should probably have a `listrawtransactions` RPC that just outputs all of the transactions known to the wallet without trying to interpret things.",

      "body": "@achow101: Thank you for your efforts. The output address is in fact a change address. `getaddressinfo` reports `\"ischange\": true`, and the descriptor from which the address was derived is marked as `\"internal\": true`. The use case is merging multiple \"dusting attack\" outputs into the same address that they had dusted so as to reveal no information to the attacker (other than that the address is still being watched and the private key for it is still known). When the dusting attack is made against an address that had originally been used to receive change, then merging the dust outputs into the change output and reusing that change address means that the merged output will be going to a change address.",
