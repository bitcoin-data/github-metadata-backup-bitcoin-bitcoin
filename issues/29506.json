Adversary connects to Bitcoin\r\n2. Stays connected to bitcoin forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\r\n\r\nCompiled from source\r\n\r\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\n### Operating system and version\r\n\r\nubuntu\r\n\r\n### Machine specifications\r\n\r\n_No response_",
