They can be written by copying the file `./test/functional/feature_backwards_compatibility.py` and modifying it to create a wallet with an older version, then check that it can be upgraded with a new version.\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nExperience with the Bitcoin Core wallet and functional test suite.\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are suitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on this. You are encouraged to comment on the issue if you are planning to work on it.

Maybe only as draft for now? \r\n\r\nRegards,",

Although I've downloaded the v0.16.3 binaries and configured them similarly to those from `./test/functional/feature_backwards_compatibility.py` the framework can't start them. The error gets thrown in test_node.py's `wait_for_rpcconnection`. Usually, it should be able to call `rpc.blockcount` from there, but as it can't create a proper RPC connection there is no way to continue test.\r\n\r\nSo I did it manually.",
