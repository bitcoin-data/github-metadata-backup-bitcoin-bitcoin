This has the implication of actually being less secure than using the traditional tap per digit system, because it limits the number of neighboring digits to 8 as opposed to the full 10.\nWith the andriod way, if the first digit for your password is 5, then your possible choices for a second digit are 1,2,3, 4 and 6, and 7,8,9.  However, consider what happens when your starting digit is 1, your next available digits become 2, 4 and 5. With the traditional method, no matter what key you start on, you may choose any other 0-9 number.\nI do applaud the creativity and innovation, but I think the security implications need to be pointed out.\n\nI would like if my wallet was encrypted taking advantage of my already existing GnuPG key. :)\n",

      "body": "Suppose we encrypt keys with the public key of a separate private key. That private key is encrypted with a symmetric algorithm, whose key is derived from the passphrase. I believe this is how GnuPG works. When we store this encrypted key in the wallet, we also store a reference to the associated private key. (Or, perhaps have it elsewhere on the file system... usb drive? smart card? keyring?) With this functionality, we could prompt the user for a password once and decrypt multiple keys. It also means that a wallet could be separated into virtual partitions with different encryption keys. I think it would allow a smooth transition, but would it be backwards compatible?[1]\n\nHere's the way I imagine interacting with this. I would keep a small amount of bitcoin in the clear. This allows me to easily spend the small amount while assuring I won't lose much if my device is compromised (good for mobile devices). I can easily encrypt/decrypt keys by entering a target amount to \"transfer\". The actual amount is determined by picking keys with transactions (outputs?) summing to approximately the target. In order to spend more than is in the clear, I must enter one (or more) passphrases, but the rest is automated.\n\n[1]Can the structure of the wallet be modified for encrypted keys and a reference to the encrypting private key without causing a breaking change?\n",

      "body": "Fnordsoft, I hope the GPG mechanism is simpler - the pass phrase is hashed into a symmetric key, and that key is used to encrypt the sensitive data in the wallet. Much simpler, and you don't have to worry about storing a private key anywhere. The user enters the pass phrase, and the program checks it by encrypting something with the public key, then decrypting it with the private key, and ensuring that the resulting 'something' matches the original 'something'.\n\nAs for the input, keep it simple: there's nothing wrong with the plain ol' keyboard. The Android style may work well on a mobile device, but would be a royal pain in the **\\* anywhere else.\n",

      "body": "First time user experience. I am a developer, but would like to shed light on what I encountered when discovering the world of Bit Coins.\n\nAfter reading a taste of what BCs were I download the client (developer side) and fired it up (OSX). I was met with a string of characters not too frightening for a developer and especially not when expecting crazy encryption fun times to be going on. However, I didn't quite know what I was looking at or what it meant to me. I stumbled onto Bit Faucet and it introduced the notion that these characters were an address used to receive BC. So I learned something. At some point I clicked \"New...\" and my string of characters changed; this befuddled me a bit. Some more reading calmed me as it was \"good practice\" to generate these new addresses and use them liberally.\n\nAs I continued to learn about what I had gotten myself into it came to light that the client I had downloaded was the key to whatever BTC I began to acquire. So as a developer, my first questions were, \"where is the secret key?\", \"how do I protect it?\", and \"how do I move it and still use this client?\". All of these questions are being touched on in IRC and in this thread. So I'm glad to see the discussion is taking place. However, I have yet to see reasonable discourse that talks about what sort of experience our target end-user should see. When starting a conversion in IRC #bitcoin-dev about the above questions I quickly received answers such as: \"just backup your wallet.dat file\", \"use truecrypt\", \"use gpg\", \"use a USB stick or dropbox\", et cetera. My response is... DUH! The point of the discourse was not to get an answer I am perfectly capable of doing _as a developer_. It was to discuss how to make Bit Coins and the associated software accessible to our girlfriends, mothers, and fathers. So, with all of that context, and as a development brother looking at my experience as a first time user (while it is still fresh, I discovered BC two days ago and now have 40BTC, yay), I'd like to suggest the following:\n- Do NOT generate the secret magic sauce upon the client first loading, instead, provide an introduction screen that says, \"Hey, welcome to the world of Bit Coins! Let's walk through a few concepts before you get started\". Introduce the high-level concepts of: 1) you will be creating a wallet, 2) you generate \"addresses\" which others use to send you Bit Coins 3) your wallet is the key to accessing your Bit Coins, if you create another wallet on a different device, you will have two different \"accounts\" (like at a different bank)\n- Prompt the user to create a wallet, have the default directory available, but at least introduce them to where this super sensitive information is. Then show a generating magic sauce message with a repeated explanation that THIS IS IMPORTANT\n- I personally suggest _integrating_ TrueCrypt as a sub-system of the BC client. Use a true crypt volumes to store either just the sensitive files or everything (good when using a portable USB key). Prompt the user to enter a passphrase so the true crypt volume can be created and used. People are used to passwords, opening the BC client and being prompted for a password by default won't alarm anyone.\n- True Crypt has done work to be used on portable devices. I recommend Bit Coin do the same and be completely runnable via a USB stick.\n- Provide a GUI level option to \"backup your wallet\" (ie. make a copy of the true crypt volume somewhere else). It would also be handy to be able to name your wallets and prominently display it in the client. When backing up the name would default to \"Wallet Backup 2011-02-16\" and the wallet would be marked as a backup. If a client opens a backup wallet, a warning could be issued stating as much and asking if this should now be considered a primary wallet (in the event of a restore)\n\nMy suggestions focus on education and features crucial to the adoption of Bit Coins, in my opinion. I cannot feel good about telling a non-techy about Bit Coins without these features. I want to be able to tell my girlfriend and her be able to make sense of the experience on her own. Thanks for all of the hard work thus far and I'm really enjoying my foray into the Bit Coins community.\n\nCheers,\n",

Trojans could be a problem now, and you are correct, they could be a problem when using True Crypt. To clarify, the goal of using True Crypt is as you said, to protect against theft when one no longer has access to their device OR when the bit coin client is not running (in this case, trojans mean nothing).\n\nNot to derail the conversation onto malware, but I see no reason to have the wallet.dat file (or other sensitive files) open when not needed. I cannot speak to the internals of how the wallet.dat file is used, but I would summise there could be a way of \"locking\" or un-mounting the True Crypt disk when the client is not using it and prompting when necessary. That could get annoying, but more discussion on real-time protections should be in another thread. As I see it, this discussion concerns some level of inherent encryption built into the client. To be fair, my mentions of \"backups\" should be in another thread as well, but the topics tend to be mentioned together.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to clarify.\n",

It's his work, I've just integrated it into our build-system.\nThis was done in a few stages:\n- Add libtool dependency. I've tried to update all relevant docs, but very possible I missed some. Note that we don't actually make real use of libtool yet, it's only used when linking the subproject.\n- Pull in libsecp256k1 subtree\n- Add configure option \"--enable-libsecp256k1\". This is disabled by default.\n- Update the makefiles to link against the lib where necessary\n- Finally, add in the actual implementation.\n",

          "body": "Hello,\n\nI'm Evan Duffield, the lead developer of Darkcoin. We recently re-forked from Bitcoin 0.9.3 away from litecoin and after which we had a minor network fork, with 2 valid chains for a period of time. This lead many clients getting segfaults, after hitting this line of code:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.10/src/main.cpp#L1274\n\nI've looked through updates done to Bitcoin since 0.9.3 and this looks like an unknown issue in the Bitcoin codebase. This is important and must get fixed, because a good portion of the network is on vulnerable versions and my understanding is they'll all segfault when a fork condition is met. \n\nHere's the stack trace from Darkcoin.\n\ndarkcoind 0.11.0.11\n\n(gdb) bt\n#0  0x000000000046a83e in ToString (this=<error reading variable: Cannot access memory at address 0x0>) at uint256.h:343\n#1  CheckForkWarningConditions () at main.cpp:1749\n#2  0x000000000047e3d5 in AddToBlockIndex (block=..., state=..., pos=...) at main.cpp:2734\n#3  0x000000000047e9d0 in AcceptBlock (block=..., state=..., dbp=dbp@entry=0x0) at main.cpp:3065\n#4  0x000000000047f991 in ProcessBlock (state=..., pfrom=pfrom@entry=0xb6ed40, pblock=pblock@entry=0x7fffdeffc460, dbp=dbp@entry=0x0) at main.cpp:3184\n#5  0x000000000048475f in ProcessMessage (pfrom=pfrom@entry=0xb6ed40, strCommand=..., vRecv=...) at main.cpp:4468\n#6  0x0000000000486b53 in ProcessMessages (pfrom=0xb6ed40) at main.cpp:4780\n#7  0x000000000050a71f in operator() (a0=<optimized out>, this=<optimized out>) at /usr/include/boost/function/function_template.hpp:760\n#8  m_invoke (connectionBody=..., this=0x7fffdeffca60) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:368\n#9  operator() (connectionBody=..., this=0x7fffdeffca60) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:345\n#10 dereference (this=<synthetic pointer>) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/slot_call_iterator.hpp:82\n#11 dereference<boost::signals2::detail::slot_call_iterator_t<boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool(CNode*)>, boost::function<bool(const boost::signals2::connection&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::slot_invoker, std::_List_iterator<boost::shared_ptr<boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > >, boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > > (f=<synthetic pointer>) at /usr/include/boost/iterator/iterator_facade.hpp:517\n#12 operator\\* (this=<synthetic pointer>) at /usr/include/boost/iterator/iterator_facade.hpp:643\n#13 operator()<boost::signals2::detail::slot_call_iterator_t<boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool(CNode*)>, boost::function<bool(const boost::signals2::connection&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::slot_invoker, std::_List_iterator<boost::shared_ptr<boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > >, boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > > (first=..., this=<optimized out>, last=...) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/optional_last_value.hpp:34\n#14 operator()boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool, boost::signals2::detail::slot_call_iterator_t<boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool(CNode*)>, boost::function<bool(const boost::signals2::connection&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::slot_invoker, std::_List_iterator<boost::shared_ptr<boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > >, boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > > (first=..., this=<optimized out>, combiner=..., last=...) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/result_type_wrapper.hpp:53\n#15 boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool (CNode*)>, boost::function<bool (boost::signals2::connection const&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::operator()(CNode*) (this=<optimized out>, arg1=arg1@entry=0xb6ed40) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:246\n#16 0x00000000004f0155 in operator() (arg1=0xb6ed40, this=0xb240d8) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:695\n#17 ThreadMessageHandler () at net.cpp:1529\n#18 0x00000000004f7bee in TraceThread<void (*)()> (name=0x74f2d1 \"msghand\", func=0x4effa0 <ThreadMessageHandler()>) at util.h:575\n#19 0x00007ffff7f55629 in ??

          "title": "Add autoprune functionality",
          "body": "Continuing the work of @rdponticelli, this is an implementation of the autoprune functionality (see #4701).  Thanks to @rdponticelli for doing a lot of prior work on this topic; we used his work and the discussion of it as our starting point (though we found it easier to base this pull off of master).  @mrbandrews, @morcos, @ajweiss, and @sdaftuar collaborated on this pull.  \n\nTo summarize autoprune: this adds a -prune=N option to bitcoind, which if set to N>0 will enable autoprune.  When autopruning is enabled, block and undo files will be deleted to try to keep total space used by those files to below the prune target (N, in MB) specified by the user, subject to some constraints:\n- The last 288 blocks on the main chain are always kept (MIN_BLOCKS_TO_KEEP),\n- N must be at least 550MB (chosen as a value for the target that could reasonably be met, with some assumptions about block sizes, orphan rates, etc; see comment in main.h),\n- No blocks are pruned until chainActive is at least 100,000 blocks long (on mainnet; defined separately for mainnet, testnet, and regtest in chainparams as nAutopruneAfterHeight).\n\nWe’ve attempted to address the comments raised in the prior conversations; here are a few things worth noting:\n1.  Handling reorgs greater than the data stored on disk is not yet implemented.  Currently, bitcoind will exit with a message indicating that it failed to read the block on disk -- suggestions for a better error message are welcome.\n2.  We’ve disabled block relay (with a check to see if we’re NODE_NETWORK or not).  In the future when we have worked out the service bit to use for an autopruned node and the behavior for block requests, we can re-enable this appropriately.  (This differs from the behavior of #4701 .)\n3.  PruneOneBlockFile currently iterates mapBlockIndex each time to determine which entries to update; we can optimize this by maintaining a reverse lookup table so that the blocks in each blockfile are known.  \n4.  One open question is what to do if we’ve pruned before, and then are running a -reindex: what do we do with the leftover files?  In this case, the first N files will have been deleted by the pruning code, which won’t be processed in the reindex loop, but later we may try overwriting the remaining files in place.  Would it be better to, say, delete the files preemptively to prevent potential file corruption? \n5.  RPC/REST interfaces currently do not distinguish between unknown blocks/tx and pruned blocks/tx.  It's unclear if a specific error should be returned, or perhaps the block/tx query interfaces be disabled for pruned nodes.\n6. Tests and a test plan will be forthcoming.\n\n(Though this pull still needs more work to address some of the above items, we thought we'd open it now to keep review momentum on this feature moving...)\n",

Result would be those txids being added to recentRejects, messing up propagation.\n\nThat said, I haven't actually tested this yet; about to go off to a conference, so if someone else wants to confirm for me that'd be much appreciated! Or if I'm wrong you're welcome to all laugh at my expense. :)\n\nCC: @sdaftuar @sipa \n",

This issue is reproducible across versions, have tried all the way down to version 0.9.0 & witnessing the same assertion failure.\r\n\r\nUsing tools: TileGx, Linux (3.4.61), GCC / G++ 4.9.2, Libboost 1.64.0.\r\n\r\nBelieve, the dependency environment is prepared with correct versions ( Ref: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dependencies.md ). The issue seems to be due to a combination of CPU (tilegx), GCC libraries. Tbh, can't get my head around when it comes to C++ code. \r\n\r\nCan someone please help figure out the problem?\r\nThanks very much in advance.\r\nGirish.",

On one hand, that was a much harder break, on the other hand, it as a much smaller ecosystem at that time.\r\n\r\n> I'm somewhat disappointed to see that some parties that I've past identified as tech leaders still don't have sending support... which is an argument against rushing.\r\nBut maybe announcing a plan to default by version X might help some parties prioritize.",
