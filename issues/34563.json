    "body": "## Summary\n\nThe COPYING file dates \"The Bitcoin Core developers\" from 2009, but that\nproject name didn't exist until the v0.9.0 rebrand in March 2014.\n\nThis change reflects historical naming, not contributor scope — early\ncontributors' work is fully covered under \"Bitcoin Developers.\"\n\n## Evidence from git history\n\n| Commit | Date | Author | Copyright Notice |\n|--------|------|--------|-----------------|\n| `e071a3f6c06f` | 2009-08-30 | sirius-m | `Copyright (c) 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto` |\n| `98500d70a8cf` | 2010-02-12 | s_nakamoto | `Copyright (c) 2009-2010 Satoshi Nakamoto` |\n| `fc73ad644f0b` | 2010-12-13 | s_nakamoto | `Copyright (c) 2009-2010 Bitcoin Developers` |\n| `3b00e7c23164` | 2015-04-22 | sandakersmann | `Copyright (c) 2009-2015 The Bitcoin Core developers` |\n| `d552ed678c26` | 2017-09-13 | Paul Berg (committed by gmaxwell) | Restored `Bitcoin Developers` as 2nd line |\n\nKey points:\n- Satoshi replaced his own name with \"Bitcoin Developers\" in his final v0.3.19\n  release (Dec 2010, `fc73ad644f0b`)\n- The project was known as \"Bitcoin\" with \"Bitcoin Developers\" until the v0.9.0\n  rebrand to \"Bitcoin Core\" (March 2014; see #3203, #3408)\n- In 2015, `3b00e7c23164` replaced \"Bitcoin Developers\" with \"The Bitcoin Core\n  developers\" and backdated it to 2009\n- #11318 (gmaxwell, 2017) partially addressed this by restoring \"Bitcoin\n  Developers\" as a second line — sipa identified `3b00e7c` as having introduced\n  the naming error. However, the start date was not corrected\n\n## Current state\n\n```\nCopyright (c) 2009-2026 The Bitcoin Core developers\nCopyright (c) 2009-2026 Bitcoin Developers\n```\n\n## Proposed fix\n\n```\nCopyright (c) 2014-2026 The Bitcoin Core developers\nCopyright (c) 2009-2026 Bitcoin Developers\n```\n\nThe only change is `2009` → `2014` on the first line, correcting it to reflect\nwhen the \"Bitcoin Core\" name came into use. Line order is unchanged.\n\nThis is a single-number fix consistent with the project's preference for\naccurate copyright notices, as demonstrated by #11318. No change to the license\ntext itself.",
