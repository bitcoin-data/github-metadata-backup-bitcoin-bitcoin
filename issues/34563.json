    "body": "## Summary\n\nThe COPYING file dates \"The Bitcoin Core developers\" from 2009, but that\nproject name didn't exist until the v0.9.0 rebrand in March 2014.\n\nThis change reflects historical naming, not contributor scope — early\ncontributors' work is fully covered under \"Bitcoin Developers.\"\n\n## Evidence from git history\n\n| Commit | Date | Author | Copyright Notice |\n|--------|------|--------|-----------------|\n| `e071a3f6c06f` | 2009-08-30 | sirius-m | `Copyright (c) 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto` |\n| `98500d70a8cf` | 2010-02-12 | s_nakamoto | `Copyright (c) 2009-2010 Satoshi Nakamoto` |\n| `fc73ad644f0b` | 2010-12-13 | s_nakamoto | `Copyright (c) 2009-2010 Bitcoin Developers` |\n| `3b00e7c23164` | 2015-04-22 | sandakersmann | `Copyright (c) 2009-2015 The Bitcoin Core developers` |\n| `d552ed678c26` | 2017-09-13 | Paul Berg (committed by gmaxwell) | Restored `Bitcoin Developers` as 2nd line |\n\nKey points:\n- Satoshi replaced his own name with \"Bitcoin Developers\" in his final v0.3.19\n  release (Dec 2010, `fc73ad644f0b`)\n- The project was known as \"Bitcoin\" with \"Bitcoin Developers\" until the v0.9.0\n  rebrand to \"Bitcoin Core\" (March 2014; see #3203, #3408)\n- In 2015, `3b00e7c23164` replaced \"Bitcoin Developers\" with \"The Bitcoin Core\n  developers\" and backdated it to 2009\n- #11318 (gmaxwell, 2017) partially addressed this by restoring \"Bitcoin\n  Developers\" as a second line — sipa identified `3b00e7c` as having introduced\n  the naming error. However, the start date was not corrected\n\n## Current state\n\n```\nCopyright (c) 2009-2026 The Bitcoin Core developers\nCopyright (c) 2009-2026 Bitcoin Developers\n```\n\n## Proposed fix\n\n```\nCopyright (c) 2014-2026 The Bitcoin Core developers\nCopyright (c) 2009-2026 Bitcoin Developers\n```\n\nThe only change is `2009` → `2014` on the first line, correcting it to reflect\nwhen the \"Bitcoin Core\" name came into use. Line order is unchanged.\n\nThis is a single-number fix consistent with the project's preference for\naccurate copyright notices, as demonstrated by #11318. No change to the license\ntext itself.",

I wasn't around at that time, but there are certainly developers that contributed to this git repo after 2015, who have also contributed to it before. So if this is changed now, in 5 years someone else is going to change it back again. I just don't see the point here.\n\nIn any case, I'll go ahead and close this for now. The discussion can continue in the pull request. There is no need to have two threads.",
