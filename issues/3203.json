    "body": "To remove the confusion between the Bitcoin network and the reference client implementation that we maintain in this repository, both confusingly named 'bitcoin', we'd like to rebrand the client.\n\nThis has been discussed a lot before, but the following is the proposal by @gavinandresen and I agree:\n\n```\nBitcoin-Qt -->  btcore (full name 'Bitcoin Core')\nbitcoind --> btcored (full name 'Bitcoin Core Daemon')\nbitcoin-cli --> btcore-cli (full name 'Bitcoin Core CLI Client')\n```\n\nRenaming the executables is going to break some scripts, so we'd likely want to combine it with the bitcoind CLI deprecation to make sure the migration pain is short and swift instead of drawn out.\n",

Dependent files can start with \"TheApp\", e.g. you can have `TheApp-common` and so on.\n\nIn our case of the GUI BitCoin client, the application is distributed as \"**Bitcoin-Qt**\" and as a consequence anyone looking for related files will fail finding `~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin` as it does not match =~ `/^Bitcoin-Qt.*/`. _AppZapper_ is a common example of this.\n\nRelated: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5029410/how-to-detect-files-related-to-an-app-on-a-mac\n",
