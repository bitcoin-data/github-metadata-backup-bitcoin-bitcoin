    "title": "consider adding a new `interface RawTxFeed` on Mining IPC",
    "body": "Sv2 Job Declarator Server (a.k.a. JDS) needs to keep an in-memory representation of the mempool so it can validate the custom jobs it receives via `DeclareMiningJob` message\n\ncurrently, SRI JDS polls some RPCs against Bitcoin Core, but polling is rather suboptimal\n\non https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-apps/issues/26 we considered switching to an approach where we subscribe for the `rawtx` ZMQ feed... JDS would have some task that's solely dedicated to consuming this feed\n\nhowever, [I hear ZMQ is not super reliable](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-apps/issues/26#issuecomment-3621881167) and this might be a good opportunity to leverage IPC, so I'm creating this issue to brainstorm with @ryanofsky @Sjors @ismaelsadeeq whether this would make sense\n\nin order to provide something similar to a `rawtx` ZMQ feed, I can imagine the following:\n- new `createRawTxFeed` method under `interface Mining`, returning a `RawTxFeed` as a result\n- new `interface RawTxFeed` with a `waitNext` method\n\n(although I probably have blindspots and core devs might be able to imagine better approaches)\n\n`getTransactionsByWitnessId` (to be potentially introduced via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/34020) would be  useful as a secondary mechanism to be leveraged if JDS receives a `DeclareMiningJob` contains some `wtxid` that hasn't arrived on the feed yet, which could happen for two different potential reasons:\n- this specific `wtxid` is on the back of the queue while the chained calls to `RawTxFeed.waitNext` didn't fully catch up yet, in which case `getTransactionsByWitnessId` will accelerate the process\n- Bitcoin Core simply hasn't seen this tx yet, in which case `getTransactionsByWitnessId` will return an error and JDS has no option but to send `ProvideMissingTransactions` to JDC",

      "body": "> JDS polls some RPCs against Bitcoin Core\n\nCan you enumerate which RPC calls you're polling? And briefly explain why.\n\nFor streaming changes to the mempool, we'd probably want to introduce a whole new `Mempool` interface, since there are other use cases (wallets, lightning nodes, block explorers). And such an interface might as well have methods to submit new transaction (packages).\n\nWe haven't used IPC for ZMQ-style streaming yet. In the Mining interface you call a method and get a result, immediately or after a delay. So this might be quite involved.\n\nCalling a `waitNext` method and getting a response for every single new mempool transaction is simpler. But it would be very inefficient when there's dozens of new transactions per second. They could be collected in batches though.\n\nYou could also use a (package) fee rate filter so the JDS only collects transactions that are likely to be mined, fetching specific missing txs just in time via `getTransactionsByWitnessId()`.",

The wallet uses `Chain.handleNotifications` to start receiving notifications and transactions and blocks:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d9efd1e49d1df154970b6a60229eedde3ba7cffe/src/ipc/capnp/chain.capnp#L58\n\nproviding a `ChainNotifications` instance to see transactions added / removed from the mempool:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d9efd1e49d1df154970b6a60229eedde3ba7cffe/src/ipc/capnp/chain.capnp#L74-L75\n\nI will to say I don't understand enough of the context behind this to know if this design is ideal, and am curious how the JDS mempool will be managed. Is it supposed to be a superset of bitcoin core mempool + any transactions that pool participants sent? Does that also mean it will keep transactions that get dropped from the bitcoin core mempool and maybe doesn't need transactionRemovedFromMempool information?",
