Rather than sign an arbitrary message (which is generally frowned on by those smarter than me at cryptography; as I recall, a carefully-crafted message can make it easier to perform certain types of known-plaintext attacks)... um, where was I? Oh, yeah, what about adding specific RPC commands to issue a specific message? For example, if you want to prove you own(ed) a particular coin, you could issue a command something like \"getproofofownership <address>\". Of course, under the hood that would be implemented using a routine that signs a message string, but the contents of the message string would be under the program's control.\n\nThat would also force us to think through the specific use-cases for which this feature is needed.\n",

It's his work, I've just integrated it into our build-system.\nThis was done in a few stages:\n- Add libtool dependency. I've tried to update all relevant docs, but very possible I missed some. Note that we don't actually make real use of libtool yet, it's only used when linking the subproject.\n- Pull in libsecp256k1 subtree\n- Add configure option \"--enable-libsecp256k1\". This is disabled by default.\n- Update the makefiles to link against the lib where necessary\n- Finally, add in the actual implementation.\n",

We recently re-forked from Bitcoin 0.9.3 away from litecoin and after which we had a minor network fork, with 2 valid chains for a period of time. This lead many clients getting segfaults, after hitting this line of code:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.10/src/main.cpp#L1274\n\nI've looked through updates done to Bitcoin since 0.9.3 and this looks like an unknown issue in the Bitcoin codebase. This is important and must get fixed, because a good portion of the network is on vulnerable versions and my understanding is they'll all segfault when a fork condition is met. \n\nHere's the stack trace from Darkcoin.\n\ndarkcoind 0.11.0.11\n\n(gdb) bt\n#0  0x000000000046a83e in ToString (this=<error reading variable: Cannot access memory at address 0x0>) at uint256.h:343\n#1  CheckForkWarningConditions () at main.cpp:1749\n#2  0x000000000047e3d5 in AddToBlockIndex (block=..., state=..., pos=...) at main.cpp:2734\n#3  0x000000000047e9d0 in AcceptBlock (block=..., state=..., dbp=dbp@entry=0x0) at main.cpp:3065\n#4  0x000000000047f991 in ProcessBlock (state=..., pfrom=pfrom@entry=0xb6ed40, pblock=pblock@entry=0x7fffdeffc460, dbp=dbp@entry=0x0) at main.cpp:3184\n#5  0x000000000048475f in ProcessMessage (pfrom=pfrom@entry=0xb6ed40, strCommand=..., vRecv=...) at main.cpp:4468\n#6  0x0000000000486b53 in ProcessMessages (pfrom=0xb6ed40) at main.cpp:4780\n#7  0x000000000050a71f in operator() (a0=<optimized out>, this=<optimized out>) at /usr/include/boost/function/function_template.hpp:760\n#8  m_invoke (connectionBody=..., this=0x7fffdeffca60) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:368\n#9  operator() (connectionBody=..., this=0x7fffdeffca60) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:345\n#10 dereference (this=<synthetic pointer>) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/slot_call_iterator.hpp:82\n#11 dereference<boost::signals2::detail::slot_call_iterator_t<boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool(CNode*)>, boost::function<bool(const boost::signals2::connection&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::slot_invoker, std::_List_iterator<boost::shared_ptr<boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > >, boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > > (f=<synthetic pointer>) at /usr/include/boost/iterator/iterator_facade.hpp:517\n#12 operator\\* (this=<synthetic pointer>) at /usr/include/boost/iterator/iterator_facade.hpp:643\n#13 operator()<boost::signals2::detail::slot_call_iterator_t<boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool(CNode*)>, boost::function<bool(const boost::signals2::connection&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::slot_invoker, std::_List_iterator<boost::shared_ptr<boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > >, boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > > (first=..., this=<optimized out>, last=...) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/optional_last_value.hpp:34\n#14 operator()boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool, boost::signals2::detail::slot_call_iterator_t<boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool(CNode*)>, boost::function<bool(const boost::signals2::connection&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::slot_invoker, std::_List_iterator<boost::shared_ptr<boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > >, boost::signals2::detail::connection_body<std::pair<boost::signals2::detail::slot_meta_group, boost::optional<int> >, boost::signals2::slot1<bool, CNode*, boost::function<bool(CNode*)> >, boost::signals2::mutex> > > (first=..., this=<optimized out>, combiner=..., last=...) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/result_type_wrapper.hpp:53\n#15 boost::signals2::detail::signal1_impl<bool, CNode*, boost::signals2::optional_last_value<bool>, int, std::less<int>, boost::function<bool (CNode*)>, boost::function<bool (boost::signals2::connection const&, CNode*)>, boost::signals2::mutex>::operator()(CNode*) (this=<optimized out>, arg1=arg1@entry=0xb6ed40) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:246\n#16 0x00000000004f0155 in operator() (arg1=0xb6ed40, this=0xb240d8) at /usr/include/boost/signals2/detail/signal_template.hpp:695\n#17 ThreadMessageHandler () at net.cpp:1529\n#18 0x00000000004f7bee in TraceThread<void (*)()> (name=0x74f2d1 \"msghand\", func=0x4effa0 <ThreadMessageHandler()>) at util.h:575\n#19 0x00007ffff7f55629 in ??

          "title": "Add autoprune functionality",
          "body": "Continuing the work of @rdponticelli, this is an implementation of the autoprune functionality (see #4701).  Thanks to @rdponticelli for doing a lot of prior work on this topic; we used his work and the discussion of it as our starting point (though we found it easier to base this pull off of master).  @mrbandrews, @morcos, @ajweiss, and @sdaftuar collaborated on this pull.  \n\nTo summarize autoprune: this adds a -prune=N option to bitcoind, which if set to N>0 will enable autoprune.  When autopruning is enabled, block and undo files will be deleted to try to keep total space used by those files to below the prune target (N, in MB) specified by the user, subject to some constraints:\n- The last 288 blocks on the main chain are always kept (MIN_BLOCKS_TO_KEEP),\n- N must be at least 550MB (chosen as a value for the target that could reasonably be met, with some assumptions about block sizes, orphan rates, etc; see comment in main.h),\n- No blocks are pruned until chainActive is at least 100,000 blocks long (on mainnet; defined separately for mainnet, testnet, and regtest in chainparams as nAutopruneAfterHeight).\n\nWe’ve attempted to address the comments raised in the prior conversations; here are a few things worth noting:\n1.  Handling reorgs greater than the data stored on disk is not yet implemented.  Currently, bitcoind will exit with a message indicating that it failed to read the block on disk -- suggestions for a better error message are welcome.\n2.  We’ve disabled block relay (with a check to see if we’re NODE_NETWORK or not).  In the future when we have worked out the service bit to use for an autopruned node and the behavior for block requests, we can re-enable this appropriately.  (This differs from the behavior of #4701 .)\n3.  PruneOneBlockFile currently iterates mapBlockIndex each time to determine which entries to update; we can optimize this by maintaining a reverse lookup table so that the blocks in each blockfile are known.  \n4.  One open question is what to do if we’ve pruned before, and then are running a -reindex: what do we do with the leftover files?  In this case, the first N files will have been deleted by the pruning code, which won’t be processed in the reindex loop, but later we may try overwriting the remaining files in place.  Would it be better to, say, delete the files preemptively to prevent potential file corruption? \n5.  RPC/REST interfaces currently do not distinguish between unknown blocks/tx and pruned blocks/tx.  It's unclear if a specific error should be returned, or perhaps the block/tx query interfaces be disabled for pruned nodes.\n6. Tests and a test plan will be forthcoming.\n\n(Though this pull still needs more work to address some of the above items, we thought we'd open it now to keep review momentum on this feature moving...)\n",

A kill -9 is required to make the process terminate.\r\n\r\nTested on three separate fully updated CentOS 6 installations with kernel 2.6.32-642.15.1.el6.x86_64, all of which were behaving normally with 0.13.2.

          "body": "Since Bitcoin Core v0.8, we've used a per-tx model for the chainstate database and its cache. This means that the database is effectively a map from txids to the *list* of unspent outputs for that transaction. This PR changes that to a map from outpoints ((txid,index) pairs) to just the *individual* unspent output for that outpoint.\r\n\r\nThe original reason for aggregating the outputs per transaction was to save space: this way, we could avoid duplicating the txid and transaction meta across the multiple outputs. However, LevelDB internally uses an encoding that omits repeated prefix bytes in keys, and because of that, duplicating the txids is not very significant.\r\n\r\nThere are many advantages for using a per-txout model:\r\n* Simpler code.\r\n* Avoiding the CPU overhead of deserializing and serializing the unused outputs.\r\n* More predictable memory usage.\r\n* More easily adaptable to various cache flushing strategies.\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n* Slightly larger on-disk representation, and sometimes larger in-memory representation (when there are multiple outputs for the same txid in the cache, which becomes optional).\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n* The main commit from #10248. We'll be dropping tx nVersion from the undo data later, so reserializing data from disk won't roundtrip anymore. This change allows us to compute the checksum based on the written data rather than the reserialized data.\r\n* #10249, as we'll be using some c++11 methods of std::unordered_map which aren't available in all versions of boost::unordered_map.\r\n* #10250, as the new tests trigger the problem fixed there.\r\n* A forward-compatible undo data format change (new versions can use old undo data, not the other way around).\r\n* Switch to a new per-txout coinsview model with related database changes.\r\n* Upgrade code to convert the old chainstate to a new chainstate (which is interruptible).\r\n* Adapted unit and functional tests (thanks to @ryanofsky for adapting the unit tests).\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n* All existing unit and functional tests pass.\r\n* Manually verified that continuing a reindex started with old code succeeds (even when recovering from a crash in the middle of flushing while upgrading).\r\n\r\nCommit links:\r\n\r\nPreparation:\r\n\r\n* e66dbde6d14cb5f253b3bf8850a98f4fda2d9f49: Add SizeEstimate to CDBBatch\r\n* f54580e7e4f225bb615204daef32f72ab8688418: error() in disconnect for disk corruption, not inconsistency\r\n* e484652fc36ef7135cf08ad380ea7142b6cbadc0: Introduce CHashVerifier to hash read data\r\n* 7e0032290669fae5f52c256856c53038511c7db4: Add specialization of SipHash for 256 + 32 bit data\r\n* d342424301013ec47dc146a4beb49d5c9319d80a: Remove/ignore tx version in utxo and undo\r\n* c3aa0c11947dfd82702df276d39bb7f748dd83a1: Report on-disk size in gettxoutsetinfo\r\n* 7d991b55dbf0b0f6e21c0680ee3ebd09df09012f: Store/allow tx metadata in all undo records\r\n\r\nSwitch to COutPoint/Coin instead of uint256/CCoins:\r\n* 422634e2f5ac1ff74cd358144cecbac63007adc4: Introduce Coin, a single unspent output\r\n* cb2c7fdac2dc74368ed24ae4717ed72178956b92: Replace CTxInUndo with Coin\r\n* bd83111a0fcfdb97204a0180bcf861d3b53bb6c2: Optimization: Coin&& to ApplyTxInUndo\r\n* 000391132608343c66488d62625c714814959bc9: Introduce new per-txout CCoinsViewCache functions\r\n* f68cdfe92b37f5a75be612b7de3c1a03245696d0: Switch from per-tx to per-txout CCoinsViewCache methods in some places\r\n* c87b957a32e03c09d410abadf661f87eb813bcdb: Only pass things committed to by tx's witness hash to CScriptCheck\r\n* 8b3868c1b4bf89c41b26ecb3a4b7c3a2557e3868: Switch CScriptCheck to use Coin instead of CCoins\r\n* 961e4839793f8b4ad37d29672faf1695ff6ec03a: Switch tests from ModifyCoins to AddCoin/SpendCoin\r\n* 05293f3cb75ad08ca23cba8e795e27d4d5e4d690: Remove ModifyCoins/ModifyNewCoins\r\n* 13870b56fcd0bfacedce3ae42a3de3d5e9dc7bc1: Replace CCoins-based CTxMemPool::pruneSpent with isSpent\r\n* 4ec0d9e794e3f338e1ebb8b644ae890d2c2da2ee: Refactor GetUTXOStats in preparation for per-COutPoint iteration\r\n* 50830796889ecaa458871f1db878c255dd2554cb: Switch CCoinsView and chainstate db from per-txid to per-txout\r\n\r\nCleanup:\r\n* ce23efaa5c2e8e50744a896424b01052db34a3d6: Extend coins_tests\r\n* 97072d6685564dd50aab4c145b1758ccc10863b3: Remove unused CCoins methods\r\n* 41aa5b79a3d79f8afe4c556b4f14fb1dc0cc3f9f: Pack Coin more tightly\r\n* b2af357f39c7d17ab6ddb2938531155bf90126ec: Reduce reserved memory space for flushing\r\n* 8b25d2c0ce64d7f8577a0c2e601e505c9f1140bf: Upgrade from per-tx database to per-txout\r\n* 580b023092a28f444068b53792eb542f9d5e6892: [MOVEONLY] Move old CCoins class to txdb.cpp\r\n* 119e552f7ccd49c0137a3c6b4f94018a84d69620: Merge CCoinsViewCache's GetOutputFor and AccessCoin\r\n* 73de2c1ff345ac38c098d7b1bef03176f3ea1f16: Rename CCoinsCacheEntry::coins to coin\r\n* a5e02bc7f8a1af27fcafd892d8da651e8f1ab156: Increase travis unit test timeout\r\n* 589827975f9f241e2f23eb674a7383592bff1cad: scripted-diff: various renames for per-utxo consistency\r\n",

This issue is reproducible across versions, have tried all the way down to version 0.9.0 & witnessing the same assertion failure.\r\n\r\nUsing tools: TileGx, Linux (3.4.61), GCC / G++ 4.9.2, Libboost 1.64.0.\r\n\r\nBelieve, the dependency environment is prepared with correct versions ( Ref: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dependencies.md ). The issue seems to be due to a combination of CPU (tilegx), GCC libraries. Tbh, can't get my head around when it comes to C++ code. \r\n\r\nCan someone please help figure out the problem?\r\nThanks very much in advance.\r\nGirish.",
