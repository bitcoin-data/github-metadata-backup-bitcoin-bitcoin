One percent might not sound like a big deal, but when one million gamers play the game on any given day that means 10,000 would have at least one crash bug. Our programming team could spend weeks researching the bugs for just one day at that rate!\n\nA lot of bug hunting on something as processor and ram intensive and requiring 100% math accuracy like Bitcoin, is likely to be unrepeatable - it's going to be Bitcoin revealing to users their hardware problems. A similar hardware fitness test like the article describes, running before initial-download or during idle cpu, to certify a system's error-free crypto and 8GB of it's storage before attempting to assemble and verify a bit-accurate database, may prevent tears later.\n",

      "body": "On Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) with Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.5, I was getting the \"System Error: Database Corrupted\" error every time I started the Bitcoin-Qt client. I tried deleting everything in my Bitcoin directory except `peers.dat` and `wallet.dat`, but the error persisted. \n\nWhat fixed it for me was deleting everything _including_ `peers.dat`. \n\nFor the record, here's what `debug.log` was showing:\n\n```\nBitcoin version v0.8.5-beta (2013-09-12 13:35:18 +1000)\nUsing OpenSSL version OpenSSL 1.0.1c 10 May 2012\nStartup time: 2013-11-10 14:58:06\nDefault data directory /Users/raam/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin\nUsing data directory /Users/raam/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin\nUsing at most 125 connections (2560 file descriptors available)\nUsing 4 threads for script verification\ninit message: Verifying wallet...\ndbenv.open LogDir=/Users/raam/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/database ErrorFile=/Users/raam/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/db.log\nBound to [::]:8333\nBound to 0.0.0.0:8333\ninit message: Loading block index...\nOpening LevelDB in /Users/raam/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/blocks/index\nOpened LevelDB successfully\nOpening LevelDB in /Users/raam/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/chainstate\nOpened LevelDB successfully\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): last block file = 3\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): last block file info: CBlockFileInfo(blocks=1563, size=37123020, heights=136929...138491, time=2011-07-18...2011-07-28)\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): transaction index disabled\nLoadBlockIndexDB(): hashBestChain=00000000000008ef809c70a6ca5da21a03e3e69c105ed29cf285d816ac8a1504  height=138490 date=2011-07-28 14:18:58\ninit message: Verifying blocks...\nVerifying last 288 blocks at level 3\nNo coin database inconsistencies in last 289 blocks (12767 transactions)\n block index            3730ms\ninit message: Loading wallet...\nnFileVersion = 80500\n wallet                   38ms\nLevelDB read failure: Corruption: block checksum mismatch\n*** System error: Database corrupted\ninit message: Loading addresses...\nLoaded 18043 addresses from peers.dat  66ms\nFlush(false)\nwallet.dat refcount=0\nwallet.dat checkpoint\nwallet.dat detach\nwallet.dat closed\nDBFlush(false) ended              29ms\nStopNode()\nFlushed 18043 addresses to peers.dat  34ms\nCommitting 12178 changed transactions to coin database...\nFlush(true)\nwallet.dat refcount=0\nwallet.dat checkpoint\nwallet.dat detach\nwallet.dat closed\nDBFlush(true) ended              40ms\n```\n\nSo, it appears to have been an issue with `peers.dat`.
