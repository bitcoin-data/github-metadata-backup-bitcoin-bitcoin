      "body": "The reason the `ipcbind` option doesn't support TCP currently is that there's no authentication, so listening on a TCP socket would let any process on the system running as any user connect to the port, and potentially access wallets or take advantage of privileges the bitcoin process has.\n\nSo currently:\n\n- ssh provides a reasonable way to forward sockets with permissions and authentication (`ssh -L /tmp/local.sock:/path/to/remote.sock user@remotehost` or `ssh -R /tmp/remote.sock:/path/to/local.sock user@remotehost)\n\n- socat provides a reasonable way to forward sockets if authentication is not important\n\nLooking ahead:\n\n- It shouldn't be too hard to support `AF_VSOCK` (virtio sockets) for communication between vm host and guest processes. These should be more secure and more performant than TCP sockets.\n\n- It shouldn't be too hard to add an authentication mechanism using cookies or hashed passwords and support authenticated TCP sockets, if there is a good use-case, \n\n- It might make sense to let the `-ipcconnect` option support TCP sockets even if the `-ipcbind` option doesn't support them, so maybe you only need one socat process not two if forwarding over TCP.",

Currently this involves running a Stratum (v1) solo mining pool, which just adds needless complexity.\n\nThat said, as soon as you have more than one device you're going to need pool software to divide the work between them. At that point it makes more sense to run a sidecar application on the same machine as the node, and have it listen on TCP and deal with authentication.",
