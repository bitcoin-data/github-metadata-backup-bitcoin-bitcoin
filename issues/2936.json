    "title": "PaymentRequest GUI bugs",
    "body": "I consider these low priority, for two reasons:\n\n1) I think the vast majority of payment requests will be signed and will involve payment to just one merchant.\n\n2) I think the whole \"send\" GUI needs a redesign; I tried to do the absolute minimum amount of GUI work to demonstrate payment protocol functionality (I'm a terrible GUI designer).\n\nFrom michagogo:\n\nBinary used: http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/a41d5fe01947f2f878c055670986a165af800f9a/bitcoin/bitcoin-qt.exe\n\nOn the unsigned payment request test, even though the address and amount _are_ editable, editing them doesn't have any effect -- the address and value entered into the web form are what ends up getting sent regardless of what's entered into those boxes.\n\nIn the Signed payment request test: I don't know if this is intentional, but if clicking on more CLICK TO PAY links before confirming the first send causes the other payments to be added as outputs to the transaction, with no way to remove individual transactions without using the Clear All button.\n\nWhen sending multiple PaymentACKs, the dialog boxes are modal on top of each other, and out of order.\n\nA signed request, even one with multiple outputs, will show up in the Send tab as one entry, while an unsigned request with multiple outputs shows up as one entry per output.\n\nEither unsigned requests cannot expire and the request generator just doesn't make that clear, or expiration is ignored in unsigned requests.\n\nI'm not sure if I like the behavior of \"unsigned payment requests add the address to your address book with the contents of the memo field if it's not already there\"... I'd maybe make it a checkbox or something, if not remove it completely -- oh, just realized it's because it uses the \"Label\" field. Seems like a bad idea to me, since payment-protocol addresses are probably not going to be reused...\n",

The signed Payment Request would still allow to verify the identity of the recipient.\n\nBe aware that solving this would probably increase the priority of this other bug: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2936\nWhich I have just updated with more information.\n",

It is otherwiese a normal payment-request, which can contain multiple send-to-addresses, right?\n\nCurrently GUI code differentiates between secure and insecure payment-requests, the insecure ones generate one sendcoinsentry for each send-to-address (displayed in the GUI), while secure ones don't do this (one entry and no addresses displayed in the sendcoins dialog).\n\nNow consider an insecure payment-request with 3 send-to-addresses (A, B and C). Current code attaches the payment-request to the first displayed entry (only showing address A), while still adding 2 entries for the other addresses (B and C).\n\nWhat does this result in? Payments to address A, B and C via the payment-request embedded in GUI entry 1 and payments to B and C via the separate GUI entries!\n\nSeems like a heavy bug IMHO?\n",

This keeps sending in one place, which is safe and recognizable.\n\nBut IMO it should always be one sendcoins entry per payment request, even for non-signed/secure one, so that they can be removed in one go. That entry should show the total amount sent so that there is no confusion in how much is sent. The background color could be used to distinguish signed and non-signed ones. It should not be editable in either case.\n\nIt usually doesn't really matter for the user to which address(es) which amount is sent, although it'd be useful to be able to expand it and/or show details for those curious.\n",

And we should really get rid of the address book as it is and change it to \"historical addresses\". But that's a different topic (#2429).\n\nAlso we need to introduce per-transaction messages somehow (I think this is already supported in the core?). This would allow showing what the payment request was about in the \"Transactions\" tab instead of abusing the label for that.\n",
