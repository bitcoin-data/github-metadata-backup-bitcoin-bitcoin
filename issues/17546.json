    "body": "It seems like it would be a easy hack to cache our docker builds (before they look at any local code) as custom docker images. \r\n\r\nThis way, our docker builds don't need to re-install and fetch a bunch of system depends while building.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that this change would make it a little trickier to change dependencies, but the time savings would be immense, unless I'm misunderstanding what Travis is able to cache presently.",

Note that it is possible (while not recommended and experimental) to run the ci system without docker.\r\n\r\nAll we need is a faster `apt`, both faster downloading and faster installing packages. All it does is download some binary blobs an put them in a directory tree. It should be possible to do all of this in seconds with a fast connection, and not 10-15 minutes.",

      "body": "I did some more apt-fast testing and found that it speeds up the download of packages in one setting: x86_64 hardware in a vanilla ubuntu docker container running on travis. All other settings (non-x86_64 hardware or non-ubuntu docker, such as debian), it would slow down. I'd guess that the default amd64 mirrors for ubuntu are over-used, whereas the others are not. So downloading in parallel will help to saturate the connection to the amd64 ubuntu mirror.\r\n\r\nAlso, for some unknown reasons, `s390x` is the fastest to download new software (and possibly also run the whole build on travis).\r\n\r\nSo we might want to switch to `s390x` for our native builds to try if that speeds up things on travis.\r\n\r\nFor local runs of the ci system, we'd need to implement some caching mechanism. Even just supporting to cache depends and the ccache would speed up local runs. A custom docker image might also speed things up, but we'd need to make sure that the image is provided for all our supported archs, not only x86_64. I don't know enough about docker on how to achieve that.",
