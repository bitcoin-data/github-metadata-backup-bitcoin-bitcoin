      "body": "I was thinking about this a little earlier and I'm not sure there is a single approach that I particularly like that I could think of. The issue I wanted to avoid was having manpages getting out of sync with `doc/files.md` (and with the binaries themselves). \r\n\r\nThis gives us a few options:\r\n\r\n1. Have the binaries' `--help` page output a files section to be parsed by `help2man` (lots of cpp changes needed. Not worth it IMO)\r\n2. We _could_ change `doc/files.md` to use a particular markdown format which could be parsed by a tool like [`ronn`](https://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/ronn.1.html), which can parse `markdown` into `roff`, then have a conversion take place and include that file into the `help2man` process. This markdown would look something like (the files section) [here](https://gist.github.com/willcl-ark/99f2be116abb858a5e55fc390a8654f3).\r\n3. We could just write the raw `roff` (looks like [this](https://gist.github.com/willcl-ark/79557c965ba72362a47ec1e14f3a343a)), but then keeping things in sync becomes a pain without writing a test or something.\r\n4. Probably other ways I didn't consider...\r\n\r\nOverall I think it's not worth the maintenance.\r\n\r\nIMO we could add a FILES section with the default datadir and wallet dir, and reference `doc/files.md` file which is both in the source distribution and on github (but not in the binary distributions-- perhaps this could be changed?)",
