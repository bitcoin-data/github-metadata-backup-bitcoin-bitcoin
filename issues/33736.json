    "body": "Creating an issue based on @glozow's suggestion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33730#issuecomment-3461843402\n\nSome [emails](https://agorism.dev/petertodd-emails.txt) were leaked on bitcointalk and Peter Todd acknowledged that they are not fake. His communication with John Dillon about bitcoin development and privacy who claims to work for government agencies potentially violates the DNS seed policy.\n\n> A DNS seed operating organization or person is expected to follow good host security practices, **maintain control of applicable infrastructure**, and **not sell or transfer control of the DNS seed**. Any hosting services contracted by the operator are equally expected to uphold these expectations.\n\nThe DNS seed should be removed from bitcoin core and replaced with other seed run by a regular contributor.\n\n",
