His communication with John Dillon about bitcoin development and privacy who claims to work for government agencies potentially violates the DNS seed policy.\n\n> A DNS seed operating organization or person is expected to follow good host security practices, **maintain control of applicable infrastructure**, and **not sell or transfer control of the DNS seed**. Any hosting services contracted by the operator are equally expected to uphold these expectations.\n\nThe DNS seed should be removed from bitcoin core and replaced with other seed run by a regular contributor.\n\n",
