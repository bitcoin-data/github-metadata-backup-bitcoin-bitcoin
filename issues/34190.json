However of your interpretation is \"toggle a connection to the bitcoin p2p network\" then the current behaviour seems fine:\n\n- If you have networkactive and toggle it, then all bitcoin p2p connections are dropped\n- Toggle it again to re-enable connections\n\nConfiguring pmp, running the addrman loop and making a connection to the tor control port in _readiness_ for future connections doesn't seem completely untoward, in my opinion.\n\nCurious what others think here though, as giving `torControlThread` and `mapport_thread` knowledge of the state of `networkactive` is pretty easy. I didn't have a look at addrman yet though...\n\nedit: I did end up taking a look at what an implementation for this would look like for mapport and torcontroller here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...willcl-ark:bitcoin:refs/heads/respect-networkactive\n\nSeems to work ok.",
