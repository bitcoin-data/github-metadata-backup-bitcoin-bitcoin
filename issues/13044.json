    "title": "[RFC] Long term plan for wallet command-line args",
    "body": "The wallet command line arguments are a mixture of start-up actions, wallet creation options, updatable wallet parameters and wallet module modes. This is a proposal on how to rationalize the different types of arguments.\r\n\r\n## Current wallet arguments\r\n\r\n- `-addresstype` (What type of addresses to use)\r\n- `-changetype` (What type of change to use)\r\n- `-disablewallet` (Do not load the wallet and disable wallet RPC calls)\r\n- `-discardfee=<amt>` (The fee rate that indicates your tolerance for discarding change by adding it to the fee)\r\n- `-fallbackfee=<amt>` (A fee rate that will be used when fee estimation has insufficient data)\r\n- `-keypool=<n>` (Key pool size)\r\n- `-mintxfee=<amt>` (Fees smaller than this are considered zero fee for transaction creation)\r\n- `-paytxfee=<amt>` (Fee to add to transactions you send)\r\n- `-rescan` (Rescan the block chain for missing wallet transactions on startup));\r\n- `-salvagewallet` (Attempt to recover private keys from a corrupt wallet on startup));\r\n- `-spendzeroconfchange` (Spend unconfirmed change when sending transactions)\r\n- `-txconfirmtarget=<n>` (If paytxfee is not set, include enough fee so transactions begin confirmation on average within n blocks)\r\n- `-upgradewallet` (Upgrade wallet to latest format on startup));\r\n- `-wallet=<path>` (Specify wallet database path. Can be specified multiple times to load multiple wallets.)\r\n- `-walletbroadcast` (Make the wallet broadcast transactions))\r\n- `-walletdir=<dir>` (Specify directory to hold wallets)\r\n- `-walletnotify=<cmd>` (Execute command when a wallet transaction changes)\r\n- `-walletrbf` (Send transactions with full-RBF opt-in enabled)\r\n- `-zapwallettxes=<mode>` (Delete all wallet transactions and only recover those parts of the blockchain through -rescan on startup)\r\n- `-dblogsize=<n>` (DEBUG) (Flush wallet database activity from memory to disk log every <n> megabytes)\r\n- `-flushwallet` (DEBUG) (Run a thread to flush wallet periodically)\r\n- `-privdb` (DEBUG) (Sets the DB_PRIVATE flag in the wallet db environment)\r\n- `-walletrejectlongchains` (DEBUG) (Wallet will not create transactions that violate mempool chain limits)\r\n\r\nThese can be categorised as follows:\r\n\r\n### Wallet module options\r\nThese act on the wallet software module, not on individual wallets:\r\n- disablewallet\r\n- ~rescan~ Removed in #23123\r\n- wallet (included here because it tells the wallet module which individual wallets to load)\r\n- walletdir\r\n- walletnotify\r\n- dblogsize (DEBUG)\r\n- flushwallet (DEBUG)\r\n- privdb (DEBUG)\r\n- walletrejectlongchains (DEBUG)\r\n\r\n### Wallet creation options\r\nCurrently none, but these options have been proposed in PRs:\r\n- ~externalhd (#9728)~ (PR closed without merging)\r\n- ~disableprivatekeys (#9662)~ (PR changed to make `disableprivatekeys` a `createwallet` RPC argument)\r\n\r\nPrior to V0.16:\r\n- ~usehd (whether to make this an HD wallet)~ Removed in #14282\r\n\r\n### Wallet startup actions\r\nThese act on an individual wallet at node startup (cannot currently be used in multiwallet mode)\r\n- ~salvagewallet~ Removed in #18918\r\n- ~upgradewallet~ Removed in #15761\r\n- ~zapwallettxes~ Remoced in #19671\r\n\r\n### Wallet config options\r\nThese are all currently treated as global wallet module options, but logically should be per-wallet config:\r\n- addresstype\r\n- changetype\r\n- keypool\r\n- ~discardfee~ (Changed to per-wallet config in #12909)\r\n- ~fallbackfee~ (Changed to per-wallet config in #12909)\r\n- ~mintxfee~ (Changed to per-wallet config in #12909)\r\n- ~paytxfee~ (Changed to per-wallet config in #12909)\r\n- spendzeroconfchange\r\n- txconfirmtarget\r\n- walletrbf\r\n\r\nThis is treated as per-wallet config, but there is currently no way to specify different config for different wallets at startup:\r\n- walletbroadcast\r\n\r\n## Proposed plan\r\n\r\n1. **Wallet startup actions** should be removed as command line args and added to an external wallet tool (#8745). We shouldn't need to spin up a full node to carry out these actions.\r\n2. **Wallet creation options** should not be added as command line args. These should be added as arguments to a new `createwallet` RPC (and as options in a new 'Create Wallet' dialog in qt).\r\n3. **Wallet config options** should be moved to be class members in CWallet, saved to/loaded from BDB wallet.dat, and updated via a `walletsettings` RPC and 'Wallet Settings` dialog in qt. Once that's in place, these should be removed as command line args.\r\n4. **Wallet module options** should remain as command line args, except `rescan`, which should be removed as a command-line argument.",

We should remove the `-rescan` argument.\r\n\r\nThere's interaction between `-rescan` and `-zapwallettxes`/`-salvagewallet` (both of those options imply `-rescan`. It'd be (marginally) easier to remove `-rescan` once those two options have been removed.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "1. Wallet startup actions\r\n\r\nAgree with moving these to a separate tool #13926. I'm assuming here that nobody uses these commands in an automated environment, so we're not breaking anyones setup by just removing this from `bitcoind`.\r\n\r\n2. Wallet creation options\r\n\r\nAlso agree that `createwallet` RPC should be used to create additional wallets, as well as for anyone who wants their default wallet to be different than the default (yikes, that's a bad sentence). I propose an additional creation option in #14938 (empty wallet).\r\n\r\n3. Wallet config options\r\n\r\nWe could add `[wallet]` specific sections in `bitcoin.conf`. Those could either override `bitcoind` arguments, or we could disallow these `bitcoind` arguments if any [wallet] section exists.\r\n\r\nOnce  #11082 is merged, it should be easy to update wallet-specific settings in config files, rather than in the payload (though I'm not fully convinced storing settings in the payload is bad).\r\n\r\nI do wonder if `spendzeroconfchange` and `txconfirmtarget` are really wallet specific things, or rather more of a mempool weather dependent global preference.\r\n\r\nIn general I'd really like to avoid having a given setting _both_ global and with wallet specific overrides.\r\n\r\n4. Wallet module options\r\n\r\nIf we add descriptor support to wallets, and assuming new wallets won't use `combo()` descriptors, then `-addresstype` and `-changetype` could safely remain global (wallet module) settings. Their meaning would then decide which descriptor to use by default when creating a new wallet, and if a wallet has multiple address type descriptors, it could pick the default for `getnewaddress` (which would fail if the descriptor type isn't present in the wallet).\r\n\r\nThe keypool might disappear altogether, so that could remain a global option for pre-descriptor wallets.",
