It would then insist that we have all blocks fully downloaded and verified.\n\nBut that might have impacts in other places in the codebase, potentially causing things to get stuck longer than needed just because we're missing a few recent blocks. So it's probably better to have a new function like `ReallyAtTheTipNow()`.\n\nBoth the `isInitialBlockDownload()` and `createNewBlock()` interface methods could switch to that. It's better for those methods to wait until we're really at the tip, because otherwise we start emitting templates for blocks that are guaranteed to be stale. ",

When starting fresh setup, its usually smooth but whenever we need to update a config or something similar and restart the setup, we encounter the following:\n\n`sv2-tp` logs (some data is redacted due to security reasons)\n```\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Default data directory\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Using data directory \n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Config file: \n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: datadir=\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: debug=sv2\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: ipcconnect=unix:/run/bitcoin/node.sock\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: loglevel=\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: sv2bind=\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: sv2port=\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Using the 'sse4(1way),sse41(4way),avx2(8way)' SHA256 implementation\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Using RdSeed as an additional entropy source\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Using RdRand as an additional entropy source\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z [ipc:info] {sv2-tp-1/sv2-tp-1} IPC client first request from current thread, constructing waiter\nConnected to bitcoin-node\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z [sv2] Reading cached static key from\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z [sv2:info] Static key: \n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z [sv2:info] Template Provider authority key: \n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z [sv2:trace] Authority key: \n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z [sv2:trace] Certificate hashed data: \n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z [sv2:info] Template Provider listening on \n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z  thread start\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z sv2 thread start\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z [ipc:info] {sv2-tp-1/b-sv2-9} IPC client first request from current thread, constructing waiter\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z [ipc:warning] {sv2-tp-1/b-capnp-loop-7} IPC client: unexpected network disconnect.\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z [ipc:error] IPC client method call interrupted by disconnect.\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z \n************************\n************************\nEXCEPTION: N3ipc9ExceptionE       \nEXCEPTION: N3ipc9ExceptionE       \nIPC client method call interrupted by disconnect.       \nIPC client method call interrupted by disconnect.       \nbitcoin in sv2       \nbitcoin in sv2       \nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'ipc::Exception'\n  what():  IPC client method call interrupted by disconnect.\n```\n\n`core-v30` logs (some data is redacted due to security reasons)\n\n```\n2025-11-28T13:40:38Z Bitcoin Core version v30.0 (release build)\n2025-11-28T13:40:38Z parameter interaction: -bind set -> setting -listen=1\n2025-11-28T13:40:38Z Using the 'sse4(1way);sse41(4way);avx2(8way)' SHA256 implementation\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Using RdSeed as an additional entropy source\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Using RdRand as an additional entropy source\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Default data directory\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Using data directory \n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Config file: \n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: bind=\"0.0.0.0\"\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: chain=\"main\"\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: datadir=\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: ipcbind=\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: port=\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: printtoconsole=\"\"\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: prune=\"1092\"\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: rpcbind=\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Command-line arg: rpcport=\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z scheduler thread start\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Listening for IPC requests on address \n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Using wallet directory \n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z init message: Verifying wallet(s)…\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z Using /16 prefix for IP bucketing\n2025-11-28T13:40:39Z init message: Loading P2P addresses…\n./node/interfaces.cpp:980 chainman: Assertion `m_node.chainman' failed.\n```\n\n",

We'll have to find another method of preventing a burst of new templates while the node churns through the last day worth of blocks.\n\nI think the fact that we have separate `createNewBlock` and `waitNext` to functions to fetch the initial block template and subsequent ones should make this easier to solve, because `createNewBlock` can be conservative and wait to return until after some cooldown period, and `waitNext` can be more responsive and always try to return as quickly as possible. So I think we could just add something like the following to `createNewBlock`\n\n```c++\nconstexpr auto COOLDOWN = 1s;\nwhile (!interrupted && (GetTime() - last_block_connected_time < COOLDOWN) && active_tip != best_known_block_header) {\n    cv.wait_for(lock, COOLDOWN);\n}\n```\n\nChecking `best_known_block_header` would just be an optimization. This wouldn't wait longer than the cooldown period to return after the last block was connected.",
