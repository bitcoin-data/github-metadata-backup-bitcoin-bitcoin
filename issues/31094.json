    "body": "### Issues, reports or feature requests related to the GUI should be opened directly on the GUI repo\n\n- [X] I still think this issue should be opened here\n\n### Report\n\nTo facilitate UTXO snapshot loading through the GUI, specifically for the QML implementation, we need to extend the Node interface in [src/interfaces/node.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/interfaces/node.h) and provide a corresponding implementation in [src/node/interfaces.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/node/interfaces.cpp).\r\n\r\nThis addition will enable the QML GUI to interact with the core functionality for loading UTXO snapshots.\r\n\r\nA draft implementation of this functionality is available for review and testing in the bitcoin/gui-qml repository, [PR 424](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml/pull/424). \r\n\r\nThis draft can serve as a reference point for the required changes and help evaluate the feature's integration with the GUI.\r\n",
