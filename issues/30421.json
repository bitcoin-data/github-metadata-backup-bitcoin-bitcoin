    "title": "utils: add support for `bitcoin-wallet` tool configuration file",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nI would like to propose the addition of support for a configuration file specifically for the `bitcoin-wallet` tool. This feature would allow users to specify command-line options in a configuration file (e.g., `wallet.conf`), similar to how `bitcoin.conf` works for `bitcoind`. The configuration file should be automatically loaded by `bitcoin-wallet` if present in the default data directory or specified via a command-line option.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nYes, this feature is related to the problem of having to repeatedly specify command-line options every time the `bitcoin-wallet` tool is used. For users who frequently interact with the `bitcoin-wallet` tool, it can be cumbersome and error-prone to enter the same options repeatedly, such as `-datadir`, `-wallet`, and debugging options.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n- **Configuration File Support**: Implement support for a `wallet.conf` file that can contain the various options and arguments currently passed via the command line.\r\n- **Automatic Loading**: If a `wallet.conf` file is found in the default data directory, it should be automatically loaded by the bitcoin-wallet tool.\r\n- **Command-line Override**: Allow users to specify an alternative configuration file location using a `-conf=<file>` command-line option.\r\n- **Option Precedence**: Command-line options should take precedence over those specified in the configuration file, allowing for flexible and dynamic usage.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "I tend to think it would be better if the wallet-tool just loaded the `bitcoin.conf` file and used applicable settings from it instead of having its own config file. I actually implemented this in ae5fc323b2441bc45c38737f1ffb40d777b134d8 from #27409 (for an unrelated reason, mentioned in the commit message).\r\n\r\nThe advantage of having one config file instead of two is it might avoid the need to specify the same settings twice, and avoid the possibility of inconsistent settings being specified. But I'm not sure if there might be other reasons for wanting a separate wallet config file. Would be curious about use-cases.",

      "body": "I see `bitcoin-wallet` as a distinct entity from `bitcoind`, `bitcoin-cli`, and `bitcoin-qt`, which are tightly coupled. `bitcoin-cli` already manages wallets alongside the node, but `bitcoin-wallet` offers independent wallet management. Having a separate `wallet.conf` allows for independent wallet management without altering node settings. It provides the flexibility to manage additional wallets without affecting the main wallet configured via bitcoin-cli and simplifies configuration for users who only need wallet-specific settings, which is beneficial in lightweight or automated environments.\r\n\r\nFor example, a developer can use bitcoin-cli to manage their main wallet with bitcoin.conf, while simultaneously using bitcoin-wallet with a separate wallet.conf to create and test multiple wallets without impacting the main wallet's settings. Using `bitcoin.conf` can indeed prevent redundancy, but a separate wallet.conf provides essential flexibility and separation for diverse use cases.",
