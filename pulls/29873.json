    "body": "Opening for discussion / conceptual review.\r\n\r\nWe like the idea of a smaller maximum transaction size because:\r\n- It lowers potential replacement cost (i.e. harder to do Rule 3 pinning via gigantic transaction)\r\n- They are easier to bin-pack in block template production\r\n- They equate to a tighter memory limit in data structures that are bounded by a number of transactions (e.g. orphanage and vExtraTxnForCompact). For example, the current memory bounds for orphanage is 100KvB * 100 = 40MB, and guaranteeing 1 tx per peer would require reserving a pretty large space.\r\n\r\nHistory for `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT=100KvB` (copied from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29873#issuecomment-2115459510):\r\n- 2010-09-13 In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3df62878c3cece15a8921fbbdee7859ee9368768 satoshi added a 100kB (MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_GEN/5 with MBS_GEN = MAX_BLOCK_SIZE/2) limit on new transactions in CreateTransaction()\r\n- 2013-02-04 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2273 In gavin gave that constant a name, and made it apply to transaction relay as well\r\n\r\nLowering `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` for all txns is not being proposed, as there are existing apps/protocols that rely on large transactions. However, it's been brought up that we should consider this for TRUCs (which is especially designed to avoid Rule 3 pinning).\r\n\r\nThis reduction should be ok because using nVersion=3 isn't standard yet, so this wouldn't break somebody's existing use case. If we find that this is too small, we can always increase it later. Decreasing would be much more difficult.\r\n~[Expected size of a commitment transaction](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#expected-weight-of-the-commitment-transaction) is within (900 + 172 * 483 + 224) / 4 = 21050vB~ EDIT: this is incorrect, but perhaps not something that should affect how we choose this number.",

Maybe in the long run the network moves towards a lower cap on transaction sizes and this can be a way to test the waters; on the other hand, if we get this wrong and there is demand for bigger TRUC transactions for some use case, we can always relax the limit later if we need to.",

But we will likely need to transmit more data when we support PTLCs, which means we'll probably reduce the maximum number of allowed PTLCs (IIRC we'll have to divide the current limits roughly by two). That would reduce the maximum size of a commitment transaction, which is IMO a good thing and would likely work with your proposed maximum of 25KvB!\r\n\r\nRegardless of that, I think you shouldn't care about the size of today's lightning transactions: whenever we start using TRUCs, we can cut down the maximum number of allowed HTLCs to ensure that the transaction size stays below 25KvB. Lightning should adapt to what's best for bitcoin more generally, and I agree that smaller transactions are desirable.",

      "body": "> Would this make things {broken, inconvenient} for potential users of TRUCs, e.g. by requiring swapping between v3 and v2?\r\n\r\nFor historical lightning channel who have already negotiated parameters above `max_accepted_htlcs` + witness spend size of legacy channel types. i.e anything before `option_anchors_zero_fee_htlc_tx`, I think. Legacy v2 commitment transactions are already opting to RBF, so shall be able to be replaced by v3. This is unclear for the splicing flow, where a counterparty could malleate one of the v2 transaction flow above v3 `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` (no guarantee that one counterparty contributes at least one input and as such sign the splice-in/out).\r\n\r\n> Is this useful for pinning, given that there are already tighter limits on commitment tx size through max_accepted_htlcs?\r\n\r\nYes if you have sane negotiated `max_accepted_htlcs` with your channel counterparties. On the other hand, you have a trade-off with off-chain HTLCs per-channel throughput (only considering non-dust HTLCs) as they won’t materialize on the commitment transaction. In practice, I think it’s really rare when LN nodes are reaching a concurrent `max_accepted_htlcs` of ~10/20 per-channel. It might be better to have a constraining `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` and have them open more pinning relatively hardened channels to scale their off-chain payment throughput (of course, it incentivizes LN nodes to occupy more space in the UTXO set…trade-offs).",

      "body": "I think the 100kB value for transaction relay was adopted as follows:\r\n\r\n * 2010-09-13 In 3df62878c3c satoshi added a 100kB (`MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_GEN/5` with `MBS_GEN = MAX_BLOCK_SIZE/2`) limit on new transactions in `CreateTransaction()`\r\n * 2013-02-04 #2273 In gavin gave that constant a name, and made it apply to transaction relay as well\r\n\r\nSo I don't think there was any deep thought put into that figure. 25kvB sounds fine to me.\r\n\r\nGiven the suggestion in the OP that it's easier to increase the value than decrease it, I'm tempted to suggest it should initially be as small as possible, perhaps as low as 10kvB? However I think increasing it is also likely to be hard in practice -- if someone designs their protocol assuming an attacker can only attach 9.9kvB of garbage to their 100vB tx, then suddenly finding out that an attacker can actually attach 24.9kvB of garbage instead might cause them unexpected problems (\"now I have to pay 2.5x as much as I'd planned??\") which might break software that had been designed based on the initial parameters.",

With no dynamic upgrades deployed, no way to restraint, without force-close and re-open. Worst than pinning exposure is no propagating TRUC transaction due to “naive” upgrade.\r\n\r\nIn the (far) future, 10kvb could be dynamic at the transaction-relay level, though this would assume LN upgrading its channel policy settings first to have something like `max_package_kvb` (or WU) to be of any practical benefit (still modulo all other safety considerations).",
