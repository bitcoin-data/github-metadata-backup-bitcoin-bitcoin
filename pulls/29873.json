    "body": "Opening for discussion / conceptual review.\r\n\r\nWe like the idea of a smaller maximum transaction size because:\r\n- It lowers potential replacement cost (i.e. harder to do Rule 3 pinning via gigantic transaction)\r\n- They are easier to bin-pack in block template production\r\n- They equate to a tighter memory limit in data structures that are bounded by a number of transactions (e.g. orphanage and vExtraTxnForCompact). For example, the current memory bounds for orphanage is 100KvB * 100 = 40MB, and guaranteeing 1 tx per peer would require reserving a pretty large space.\r\n\r\nHistory for `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT=100KvB` (copied from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29873#issuecomment-2115459510):\r\n- 2010-09-13 In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3df62878c3cece15a8921fbbdee7859ee9368768 satoshi added a 100kB (MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_GEN/5 with MBS_GEN = MAX_BLOCK_SIZE/2) limit on new transactions in CreateTransaction()\r\n- 2013-02-04 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2273 In gavin gave that constant a name, and made it apply to transaction relay as well\r\n\r\nLowering `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` for all txns is not being proposed, as there are existing apps/protocols that rely on large transactions. However, it's been brought up that we should consider this for TRUCs (which is especially designed to avoid Rule 3 pinning).\r\n\r\nThis reduction should be ok because using nVersion=3 isn't standard yet, so this wouldn't break somebody's existing use case. If we find that this is too small, we can always increase it later. Decreasing would be much more difficult.\r\n~[Expected size of a commitment transaction](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#expected-weight-of-the-commitment-transaction) is within (900 + 172 * 483 + 224) / 4 = 21050vB~ EDIT: this is incorrect, but perhaps not something that should affect how we choose this number.",

      "body": "> Would this make things {broken, inconvenient} for potential users of TRUCs, e.g. by requiring swapping between v3 and v2?\r\n\r\nJust wanted to add -- I think the case I expect more often would be that users would just create multiple transactions if they had a need to construct a transaction greater than 25kvb (similar to what I think everyone must do today to work around the current 100kvb standardness limit).\r\n\r\nThe additional transaction overhead from constructing four 25kvb transactions instead of one 100kvb transaction seems quite small, so if there's not some clear need for 100kvb transactions I think this would be great to try.  Maybe in the long run the network moves towards a lower cap on transaction sizes and this can be a way to test the waters; on the other hand, if we get this wrong and there is demand for bigger TRUC transactions for some use case, we can always relax the limit later if we need to.",

This would also help us avoid future potential issues with signedness of this value.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is safe and does not actually change what transactions would or would not be considered both standard and consensus valid. Within consensus, the only use of the version in consensus is in BIP68 validation which was already casting it to uint32_t. Within policy, although it is used as a signed int for the transaction version number check, I do not think that this change would change standardness. Standard transactions are limited to the range [1, 2]. Negative numbers would have fallen under the < 1 condition, but by making it unsigned, they are still non-standard under the > 2 condition.\r\n\r\nUnsigned and signed ints are serialized and unserialized the same way so there is no change in serialization.",

But we will likely need to transmit more data when we support PTLCs, which means we'll probably reduce the maximum number of allowed PTLCs (IIRC we'll have to divide the current limits roughly by two). That would reduce the maximum size of a commitment transaction, which is IMO a good thing and would likely work with your proposed maximum of 25KvB!\r\n\r\nRegardless of that, I think you shouldn't care about the size of today's lightning transactions: whenever we start using TRUCs, we can cut down the maximum number of allowed HTLCs to ensure that the transaction size stays below 25KvB. Lightning should adapt to what's best for bitcoin more generally, and I agree that smaller transactions are desirable.",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts.

      "body": "> Would this make things {broken, inconvenient} for potential users of TRUCs, e.g. by requiring swapping between v3 and v2?\r\n\r\nFor historical lightning channel who have already negotiated parameters above `max_accepted_htlcs` + witness spend size of legacy channel types. i.e anything before `option_anchors_zero_fee_htlc_tx`, I think. Legacy v2 commitment transactions are already opting to RBF, so shall be able to be replaced by v3. This is unclear for the splicing flow, where a counterparty could malleate one of the v2 transaction flow above v3 `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` (no guarantee that one counterparty contributes at least one input and as such sign the splice-in/out).\r\n\r\n> Is this useful for pinning, given that there are already tighter limits on commitment tx size through max_accepted_htlcs?\r\n\r\nYes if you have sane negotiated `max_accepted_htlcs` with your channel counterparties. On the other hand, you have a trade-off with off-chain HTLCs per-channel throughput (only considering non-dust HTLCs) as they won’t materialize on the commitment transaction. In practice, I think it’s really rare when LN nodes are reaching a concurrent `max_accepted_htlcs` of ~10/20 per-channel. It might be better to have a constraining `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` and have them open more pinning relatively hardened channels to scale their off-chain payment throughput (of course, it incentivizes LN nodes to occupy more space in the UTXO set…trade-offs).",

      "body": "I think the 100kB value for transaction relay was adopted as follows:\r\n\r\n * 2010-09-13 In 3df62878c3c satoshi added a 100kB (`MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_GEN/5` with `MBS_GEN = MAX_BLOCK_SIZE/2`) limit on new transactions in `CreateTransaction()`\r\n * 2013-02-04 #2273 In gavin gave that constant a name, and made it apply to transaction relay as well\r\n\r\nSo I don't think there was any deep thought put into that figure. 25kvB sounds fine to me.\r\n\r\nGiven the suggestion in the OP that it's easier to increase the value than decrease it, I'm tempted to suggest it should initially be as small as possible, perhaps as low as 10kvB? However I think increasing it is also likely to be hard in practice -- if someone designs their protocol assuming an attacker can only attach 9.9kvB of garbage to their 100vB tx, then suddenly finding out that an attacker can actually attach 24.9kvB of garbage instead might cause them unexpected problems (\"now I have to pay 2.5x as much as I'd planned??\") which might break software that had been designed based on the initial parameters.",

      "body": "From a more general wallet perspective if we're assuming ~110vbytes of overhead per additional transaction required to match an input/output set, picking 10kvB as the new limit vs 100kvB results in 10*110=1,100vb, or ~1% additional overhead vs 100kvB. At 5kvB you'd be receiving ~2% penalty, and so on.\r\n\r\nFWIW 10kvB also seems like plenty of headroom for practical LN channels with >60-HTLCs-per-direction, but below today's spec limit.\r\n\r\n",

This means the maximum v3 package vsize is 11KvB.\r\n\r\nThe `test_nondefault_package_limits` descendant limit test hit a snag (CPFP carve out grants a free +10kvB which makes it impossible to make a descendant limit stricter than 11KvB), so I added a commit to explicitly disable CPFP carve out for v3. This change should be fine since CPFP carveout's intended purpose clearly doesn't apply in the v3 world. Alternatively we can delete this test, but it felt weird that v3 could benefit from CPFP carve out.",

With no dynamic upgrades deployed, no way to restraint, without force-close and re-open. Worst than pinning exposure is no propagating TRUC transaction due to “naive” upgrade.\r\n\r\nIn the (far) future, 10kvb could be dynamic at the transaction-relay level, though this would assume LN upgrading its channel policy settings first to have something like `max_package_kvb` (or WU) to be of any practical benefit (still modulo all other safety considerations).",

          "body": "This is a BIP for Topologically Restricted Until Confirmation (TRUC) Transactions. It's also called \"v3 transaction policy\" since the marker is `nVersion=3`.\r\n\r\nA specification is useful for coordination between node impls that want to implement the same policy and applications that want to use it. For those that are not interested in the details of v3 policy, this also serves as a writeup of the specific pinning problems we aim to address. There has been discussion of using this in other protocol design and multiple requests for its documentation to exist in the BIPs repository, so I'm opening a PR here.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28948\r\n\r\nExample usage and things built on top:\r\n- Package RBF\r\n  - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28984\r\n- Ephemeral Anchors\r\n  - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29001\r\n  - https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1524\r\n- LN commitment transactions\r\n  - https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/lightning-transactions-with-v3-and-ephemeral-anchors/418\r\n  - https://github.com/instagibbs/bolts/commits/zero_fee_commitment\r\n- LN-Symmetry\r\n  - https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/ln-symmetry-project-recap/359\r\n  - https://github.com/instagibbs/lightning/tree/eltoo_support\r\n\r\nDiscussion and history:\r\n- https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html\r\n- https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff\r\n- https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html\r\n- https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/v3-transaction-policy-for-anti-pinning/340\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038",
