      "body": "Thanks for merging!\r\n\r\nSee below for a script run after this merge.\r\n\r\nI believe the remaining cases to be of the \"non-trivial\" type where the header directly included is not needed in itself but one of more of the transitively included headers are.\r\n\r\nConsider the `src/bench/rpc_blockchain.cpp` example: we are currently including `validation.h` which **transitively** gives us `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `CBlock`, `CBlockIndex` and `uint256`. But we don't need anything `validation.h` provides in itself.\r\n\r\nInstead of including `validation.h` we should include `version.h` for `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `primitives/block.h` for `CBlock`, `chain.h` for `CBlockIndex` and `uint256.h` for `uint256`.\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/bench/rpc_blockchain.cpp b/src/bench/rpc_blockchain.cpp\r\nindex 2fc6f116a..00cec5ecb 100644\r\n--- a/src/bench/rpc_blockchain.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/bench/rpc_blockchain.cpp\r\n@@ -5,9 +5,12 @@\r\n #include <bench/bench.h>\r\n #include <bench/data.h>\r\n \r\n-#include <validation.h>\r\n+#include <chain.h>\r\n+#include <primitives/block.h>\r\n #include <streams.h>\r\n #include <rpc/blockchain.h>\r\n+#include <uint256.h>\r\n+#include <version.h>\r\n \r\n #include <univalue.h>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./find_redundant_includes.sh\r\nsrc/bench/rpc_blockchain.cpp -- unused include: validation.h\r\nsrc/bench/verify_script.cpp -- unused include: script/standard.h\r\nsrc/coins.h -- unused include: core_memusage.h\r\nsrc/core_read.cpp -- unused include: script/sign.h\r\nsrc/crypto/hkdf_sha256_32.h -- unused include: crypto/hmac_sha256.h\r\nsrc/index/txindex.h -- unused include: txdb.h\r\nsrc/net.h -- unused include: addrdb.h\r\nsrc/net.h -- unused include: limitedmap.h\r\nsrc/net.h -- unused include: policy/feerate.h\r\nsrc/noui.cpp -- unused include: util/system.h\r\nsrc/psbt.h -- unused include: node/transaction.h\r\nsrc/psbt.h -- unused include: optional.h\r\nsrc/psbt.h -- unused include: policy/feerate.h\r\nsrc/qt/bantablemodel.h -- unused include: net.h\r\nsrc/qt/receivecoinsdialog.cpp -- unused include: wallet/wallet.h\r\nsrc/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp -- unused include: txmempool.h\r\nsrc/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp -- unused include: wallet/fees.h\r\nsrc/qt/signverifymessagedialog.cpp -- unused include: wallet/wallet.h\r\nsrc/qt/walletmodel.h -- unused include: script/standard.h\r\nsrc/qt/winshutdownmonitor.cpp -- unused include: util/system.h\r\nsrc/rpc/misc.cpp -- unused include: rpc/blockchain.h\r\nsrc/rpc/util.h -- unused include: node/transaction.h\r\nsrc/rpc/util.h -- unused include: script/sign.h\r\nsrc/script/sign.h -- unused include: streams.h\r\nsrc/support/events.h -- unused include: ios\r\nsrc/sync.h -- unused include: thread\r\nsrc/test/fuzz/FuzzedDataProvider.h -- unused include: utility\r\nsrc/test/fuzz/eval_script.cpp -- unused include: limits\r\nsrc/test/key_tests.cpp -- unused include: util/system.h\r\nsrc/txmempool.h -- unused include: random.h\r\nsrc/uint256.h -- unused include: assert.h\r\nsrc/util/system.h -- unused include: util/memory.h\r\nsrc/util/system.h -- unused include: util/time.h\r\nsrc/wallet/coinselection.h -- unused include: random.h\r\nsrc/wallet/crypter.h -- unused include: script/signingprovider.h\r\nsrc/wallet/test/wallet_tests.cpp -- unused include: rpc/server.h\r\nsrc/wallet/wallet.cpp -- unused include: util/validation.h\r\nsrc/wallet/walletdb.h -- unused include: script/sign.h\r\nsrc/zmq/zmqabstractnotifier.h -- unused include: zmq/zmqconfig.h\r\nsrc/zmq/zmqconfig.h -- unused include: primitives/transaction.h\r\nsrc/zmq/zmqconfig.h -- unused include: stdarg.h\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to address the above cases too? Then we should be as lean as it gets when it comes to redundant includes :)\r\n\r\nIf you do: let me know if you find any false positives/false negatives given the list above.\r\n\r\nOne caveat is that I'm currently skipping analysis for `core_io.h` due to the weird naming mismatch between `core_io.h` ⇄ `core_write.cpp`/`core_read.cpp` :)",
