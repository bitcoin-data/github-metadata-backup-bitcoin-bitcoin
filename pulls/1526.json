    "body": "This builds on #1525 (the framework for smoothly rolling out new chain/transaction rules), defining \"nVersion=2\" blocks that include the block height as the first bytes of their coinbase.\n\nPutting the height in the coinbase is desired for at least two reasons:\n1. It guarantees that every subsequent block and transaction hash is unique.\n2. It can be used to better reason about plausible difficulty for not-yet-connected blocks.\n\nThe format of the height is \"serialized CScript\" -- first byte is number of bytes in the number (will be 0x03 on main net for the next 300 or so years), following bytes are little-endian representation of the number.\n\nOnly blocks with nVersion=2 are expected to have the height as the first bytes, and the \"must have the height in the coinbase\" rule is only enforced if nVersion=2 blocks are a super-majority (75% of last 1,000 blocks on main network) of the block's immediate ancestors.\n\nThis pull also contains a rule to REJECT nVersion=1 blocks once 95% of hashing power is producing nVersion=2 blocks.  That means the last 5% of hashing power who refuse to upgrade will get orphaned.\n\nAll of this won't affect users/merchants at all, they will happily accept nVersion=1 or nVersion=2 blocks.\n\nI tested this with a testnet-in-a-box setup, creating a 100-block-long nVersion=2 chain and then making sure that:\n1. nVersion=1 blocks were accepted\n2. nVersion=2 blocks that included the wrong block height were rejected (I hacked a bitcoind to test that).\n",

The release after that happens a checkpoint can be added and the code can be simplified to \"require valid v2+ blocks.\"\n\n@luke-jr:  so we release code that creates v2 blocks, but always accepts v1 blocks.  Then a while from now we release code that creates v2 blocks but rejects v1 blocks if some threshold has been reached.  If I'm a miner, why would I risk running that code; I need to SEE network support for the \"reject v1 block\" rule before I start doing that.\n",

      "body": "I ran my 'coinbase_integers.py' tool on the chain, and somebody is producing block.nVersion=1 blocks with blockheight-1 in their coinbases; see blocks 172036 or 174854 for example (coinbases start with PUSH 172035/174853). Interesting, but not a problem.\n\nThere are also some accidental \"looks like a block height\" blocks (e.g. block 164384 starts its coinbase with PUSH 1983702).\n\nThat opens a tiny window for whoever created block 164384 to try to create a duplicate coinbase in the year 2046 when block 1,983,702 is mined. The chances of them mining that particular block will probably be pretty small, although maybe there would be some incentive for them to sell the private key to a big mining consortium who would... do something evil maybe.\n\nWe could close that remote possibility by giving the coinbase transactions nVersion=2; the transaction's version is part of the transaction id hash, so a nVersion=1 transaction will never hash to the same id as a nVersion=2 transaction.\n\nWe do have the problem that between the time we announce what we're going to do and the time when there is 75% main network support rogue miners could create block.nVersion=2 / coinbase.nVersion=2 coinbases that contain \"height = sometime in the future\".\n",
