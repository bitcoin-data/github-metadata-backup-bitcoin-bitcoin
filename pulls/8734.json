While you are in this mindset, any non-Core behaviour constitutes DOS behavior! Currently BitcoinUnlimited is 10% compared with Core 0.13, yet Core 0.13 still sends SENDCMPCT and SENDHEADER to all nodes with protocol >70013 despite Unlimited being >80000 while unlimited nodes are reporting Unknown Command in their logs for these messages.\n\nIf you were driving a car, would you not look left and right before crossing at a green light on the assumption that all other drivers were obeying the rules?\n\nI think it's time to stop assuming all nodes out there are following one set of rules, and start thinking as if Core is existing in a DECENTRALIZED network... Radical suggestion, I know...\n",
