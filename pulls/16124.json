      "body": "I'm not sure if what I'm about to say is relevant here in a practical sense, but what I've always liked about `xargs` is that it avoids a limit you can reach with a very long command line argument list. This creates a very long command line, but is okay (on my Ubuntu system running `bash`):\r\n```\r\n/bin/echo $(seq 100000) | wc\r\n      1  100000  588895\r\n$ \r\n```\r\nBut now let's go to the next order of magnitude (one million arguments):\r\n```\r\n$ /bin/echo $(seq 1000000) | wc\r\nbash: /bin/echo: Argument list too long\r\n      0       0       0\r\n```\r\nDoing this with `xargs` works:\r\n```\r\n$ seq 1000000 | xargs echo | wc\r\n     53 1000000 6888896    \r\n$ \r\n```\r\nNotice that `xargs` generated 53 individual echo commands (the number of lines as reported by `wc`). The `xargs` program is aware of the various shells' command line limits, or at least it's conservative enough that it works with any shell.\r\n\r\nSo even though it won't matter here (we're unlikely to have such a huge number of python files), I like to use `xargs` on principle whenever the command line can be arbitrarily long. So I'd vote for keeping this PR as is.",

(It did finally die.) So I recommend against trying that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, so this is why the previous comment says `/bin/echo` instead of `echo`. Of course, `flake8` is like `/bin/echo`, an external executable.",
