    "body": "For several reasons the current test framework does not allow to easily incorporate new unit tests that append specially crafted blocks to the blockchain using ProcessBlock().\nIn the pull request https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4688 we described the reasons and proposed a solution.\nWhile we think that is the optimum solution, @gmaxwell and @laanwj suggested not implementing the changes because many files not directly related to the testing framework were modified by the patch.\nIn this pull request we implement @gmaxwell suggestion that the test framework should run under the RegTest network parameters and not under the main network parameters. Allthough this seems to be a small change, it was not. First, the RegTest block solving probability was 1/2 which still requires \"mining\" during the test case validation in order to dynamically create a block, which adds unnecessary complications to simple testing code.\nTo overcome this problem, the RegTest difficulty was changed from 0x207fffff to 0x2100FFFF (in compact notation), which gives an approximate 1/2^16 probability not to solve a block. Happily there was no lucky test case.\nBecause the maximum possible target (0xff ... 0xff) cannot be multiplied by 4 without overflow, ComputeMinWork() had to be modified to always return ProofOfWorkLimit() for the RegTest.\n\nAlso we found that several test cases make explicit use of properties of the MainNet. Such test cases are:\n\nalert_tests.cpp\nrpc_wallet_tests.cpp\nmain_tests.cpp\nkey_tests.cpp\nDoS_tests.cpp\nCheckpoints_tests.cpp\nbase58_tests.cpp\nbloom_tests.cpp\nrpc_tests.cpp\nminer_tests.cpp\n\nAll these test cases were added a temporary switch from the RegTest network to the Main network in order to leave them working. Re-writting all of them for the RegTest probably requires more than 40 hours of work.\n\nThe alert_tests.cpp test case is special, because it requires the alert private key to generate inputs to the test cases. We suggest to switch this test case to the RegNet and replace the current RegTest alert private key with a published key-pair, so everyone can generate more test cases and there is no opaque data.\n\nAs the 4688  pull request, we've:\n\na. fixed the bug in miner_tests.cpp which leaves in the memory pool invalid transactions (mempool.clear() missing).\nb. Added 7 unit tests:\n\n```\nToCheckBlockUpgradeMajority (untested before)\nEnforceBlockUpgradeMajority (untested before)\nRejectBlockOutdatedMajority (untested before)\n\"bad-cb-height\"\n\"bad-version\"\n\"time-too-old\"\n\"bad-txns-nonfinal\"\n```\n\nNOTE: In the file rpc_wallet_tests.cpp, the TABs were removed and replaced with whitespace indentation. This is the standard in the rest of the code. A whitespace-ignoring compare will show no important differences.\n\nSergio Demian Lerner & Timo Hanke\n",

      "message": "Switch of the test framework from MAIN to REGTEST\nFor several reasons the current test framework does not allow to easily incorporate new unit tests that append specially crafted blocks to the blockchain using ProcessBlock().\nIn the pull request https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4688 we described the reasons and proposed a solution.\nWhile we think that is the optimum solution, @gmaxwell and @laanwj suggested not implementing the changes because many files not directly related to the testing framework were modified by the patch.\nIn this pull request we implement @gmaxwell suggestion that the test framework should run under the RegTest network parameters and not under the main network parameters. Allthough this seems to be a small change, it was not. First, the RegTest block solving probability was 1/2 which still requires \"mining\" during the test case validation in order to dynamically create a block, which adds unnecessary complications to simple testing code.\nTo overcome this problem, the RegTest difficulty was changed from 0x207fffff to 0x2100FFFF (in compact notation), which gives an approximate 1/2^32 probability not to solve a block. Happily there was no lucky test case.\nBecause themaximum possible target (0xff ... 0xff) cannot be multiplied by 4 without overflow, ComputeMinWork() had to be modified to always return ProofOfWorkLimit() for the RegTest.\n\nAlso we found that several test cases make explicit use of properties of the MainNet. Such test cases are:\n\nalert_tests.cpp\nrpc_wallet_tests.cpp\nmain_tests.cpp\nkey_tests.cpp\nDoS_tests.cpp\nCheckpoints_tests.cpp\nbase58_tests.cpp\nbloom_tests.cpp\nrpc_tests.cpp\nminer_tests.cpp\n\nAll these test cases were added a temporary switch from the RegTest network to the Main network in order to leave them working. Re-writting all of them for the RegTest probably requires more than 40 hours of work.\n\nThe alert_tests.cpp test case is special, because it requires the alert private key to generate inputs to the test cases. We suggest to switch this test case to the RegNet and replace the current RegTest alert private key with a published key-pair, so everyone can generate more test cases and there is no opaque data.\n\nAs the 4688  pull request, we've:\n\na. fixed the bug in miner_tests.cpp which leaves in the memory pool invalid transactions (mempool.clear() missing).\nb. Added 7 unit tests:\n\n    ToCheckBlockUpgradeMajority (untested before)\n    EnforceBlockUpgradeMajority (untested before)\n    RejectBlockOutdatedMajority (untested before)\n    \"bad-cb-height\"\n    \"bad-version\"\n    \"time-too-old\"\n    \"bad-txns-nonfinal\"\n\nSergio Demian Lerner & Timo Hanke",

We suggest creating another regression testing network parameters, called MAIN_REGTEST that inherits from MAIN and it just changes the block difficulty.\nThen we won't need any modification on the previous test-cases, because all of them will use the same MAIN parameters as the MAIN_REGTEST.\n\nTo summarize this pull request and  #4688 we have 4 possibilities:\n1. Let the test framework run in MAIN and add the suppression of block work global variable (this is #4688). Problem: some do not like adding this variable.\n2. Switch the framework to REGTEST. Problem: some test cases use MAIN parameters and we don't want to break the REGTEST codes of other Bitcoin implementations.\n3. Keep using MAIN for the test framework. Problem: Is ugly. Needs mining. Makes debugging harder. GMaxwell thinks MAIN was not intended for the testing framework, but REGTEST was.\n4. Switch the framework to a new MAIN_REGTEST network inheriting from MAIN, but sets difficulty to zero. Very simple. Add 10 lines of code. Everything keeps working as is. Does not break anything. \n\nI still think that 1 was the best choice.\nBut from peoples comments I suppose number 4 would be an consented choice.\n",

But one must take into account that switching network parameters is only possible for test cases that do not call ProcessBlock(). All test cases that call ProcessBlock() must probably share the same parameters to prevent incompatibilities (which is not that bad) . If we'd really like complete free control of the block-chain for each unit test, then we would need to incorporate the block-chain destroy/creation code present in #4688.\n",

Again, this should much simpler to do now that there's no Params().NetworkID() Params().isMainNet() and Params().isTestNet() all around.\nSo anyway, NACK on all new uses of Params().NetworkID() maybe besides checkpoint_test, I just cleaned that up not too long ago. The remaining uses of NetworkID() (isMainet and isTestnet has been removed) are:\n\n1) A switch in checkpoints.cpp to select the data.\n2) A couple of Params().NetworkID() == CBaseChainParams::TESTNET for \"testnet\" fields that should be deprecated as soon as we break rpc backwards compatibility in rpcmisc and rpcmining\n3) A Params().NetworkID() != CBaseChainParams::MAIN check in qt/bitcoin.cpp to select orange or green.\n\nIf it's possible we should get rid of those, not create more.\n",

          "title": "Switch testing framework from MAIN to new UNITTEST network",
          "body": "This is our third attempt to improve the testing framework taking into account all previous comments and suggestions. The two previous attempts are: pull requests #4688 and #4732.\n\nSummary: For several reasons the current test framework does not allow to easily incorporate new unit tests that append specially crafted blocks to the blockchain using ProcessBlock().\nAfter we proposed a solution in #4688 @gmaxwell and @laanwj suggested not implementing the changes because many files not directly related to the testing framework were modified by the patch.\nIn the pull request #4732 we implement @gmaxwell suggestion that the test framework should run under the RegTest network parameters and not under the main network parameters. It was discovered that 10 unit cases are designed for the MAIN net, RegTest inherits from TestNet, which has many differences, so switching is not simple nor desired. @mikehearn and @laanwj proposed using a special new network called UNITTEST to be as similar to the real net as possible. We implemented this final suggestion.\n\nIn this pull request we implement UNITTEST. We reintroduced the criticized possibility to disable PoW check, but we did it under Params().SkipProofOfWorkCheck(). This method is a const virtual function that returns false for MAIN net, so there is no possibility that it is switched to true, under normal circumstances. This change does not extend the attack surface in any way.\n\nThe child network UNITTEST overrides SkipProofOfWorkCheck() to provide the skipping functionality.\nTo allow test cases to modify network parameters, we've added the ModifiableParams() global variable and associated abstract interface, with setters. These setters are only available if the current network is UNITTEST. Again, there is no way to modify the network parameters if the current network is not UNITTEST.\n\nAs in the previous pull requests, we've:\n\na. fixed the bug in miner_tests.cpp which leaves in the memory pool invalid transactions (mempool.clear() missing).\nb. Added 7 unit tests:\n\nToCheckBlockUpgradeMajority (untested before)\nEnforceBlockUpgradeMajority (untested before)\nRejectBlockOutdatedMajority (untested before)\n\"bad-cb-height\"\n\"bad-version\"\n\"time-too-old\"\n\"bad-txns-nonfinal\"\n\nSergio Demian Lerner & Timo Hanke\n",
