    "body": "The logging RPC does not work as intended and as documented in its help when `0` or `none` are passed.\r\n\r\nPer the RPC logging help:\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli help logging\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following are available as category names with special meanings:\r\n  - \"all\",  \"1\" : represent all logging categories.\r\n  - \"none\", \"0\" : even if other logging categories are specified, ignore all of them.\r\n```\r\n    \r\nThe behavior and documentation were added in #11191, but over time and extended refactoring, the behavior no longer works in master and versions 22/23/24 (the last supported versions currently) -- passing `0`/`none` has no effect.  As there was no test coverage, the regressions went uncaught.  In v24, `none` became unrecognized:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli logging '[\"none\"]'\r\nerror code: -8\r\nerror message:\r\nunknown logging category none\r\n```\r\n    \r\nDuring the same time period, passing `1` and `all` has been operational and documented. \r\n\r\nSolution: detect `none`/`0` values and add test coverage in any case, and either:\r\n    \r\n- leave the functionality out, raise with an error message if the values are passed, and update the RPC help documentation, or\r\n\r\n- fix the behavior by returning early.\r\n\r\nBoth solutions involve essentially the same code size and complexity.  Given that `all`/`1` has been operational, and that `none`/`0` has been documented and appears per the code of the original PR to have been operational, it seems preferable for consistency to support `none`/`0` in symmetry with `all`/`1` and as ACKed, intended, and documented in #11191.\r\n\r\nDone by this pull:    \r\n- add missing RPC logging logic and test coverage\r\n- update the `-debug` and `-debugexclude` config options to use the same code for consistency in behavior between them, and for consistency with the logging RPC that provides the same behavior for both `-include` and `-exclude`\r\n- improve the user-facing documentation and examples; can be tested with `./src/bitcoind -h | grep -A12 \"\\-debug=<\\|debugexclude\" && ./src/bitcoin-cli help logging`\r\n\r\nIf it is decided to backport a fix, commit `Fix RPC logging behavior when \"0\" and \"none\" values are passed` could probably suffice.",

A couple lines could be saved by removing the `-debugexclude` config option, but that option is practical to have, as seen by its use in our own unit/fuzz and functional test frameworks.\r\n\r\nIt seems the way forward from here is to detect `none/0` values, add test coverage and then either:\r\n    \r\n- leave the functionality out, raise with an error message if `none/0` values are passed, and update the RPC help documentation, or\r\n\r\n- simply fix the original behavior by returning early.\r\n\r\nBoth involve similar code size/complexity and the second option seems preferable.  The updated code here is about the same length as before, modulo missing test coverage and improved documentation.\r\n\r\nIn the last pushes I've updated the PR description and first commit message with this info and improved the code and tests.  This should be ready for further review!",

As there was no test coverage, the regressions went uncaught.  In v24,\n`none` became unrecognized.\n\nDuring the same time period, passing `1` and `all` has been operational and documented.\n\nWe therefore need to detect none/0 values and add test coverage in any case, and either:\n\n- leave the functionality out, raise with an error message if none/0 are passed,\n  and update the RPC help documentation, or\n\n- fix the behavior by returning early.\n\nBoth solutions involve essentially the same code size and complexity.  Given\nthat all/1 has been operational, and that none/0 has been documented and appears\nto have been operational previously, it seems preferable for consistency to\nsupport none/0 in symmetry with all/1, and as ACKed, intended, and documented\nsince #11191.\n\n---\n\nThis commit therefore adds:\n\n- the missing logic to make the functionality work\n\n- a missing logging.h include header\n\n- the relevant info in the logging RPC help doc",

And you get the same \"actually, for this run I want to disable debugging stuff\" by adding `-nodebug` at the end (eg, on the cli) or by specifying \"-debugexclude=all\". For the logging rpc, just replace the argument with `[]` instead of adding none seems reasonable.",

At least until the refactorings get too intense. AAAA+++ excellent alias, highly recommended)\r\n\r\n> That is what I meant by `\"Solution: detect none/0 values and add test coverage in any case\"`, for either way requires code, test coverage, and documentation changes. As I wrote, I prefer the route of fixing what was ACKed, intended, and documented in #11191.\r\n\r\nWhy? The people who ACKed an old PR aren't gods, and we don't have to take their opinions at the time as gospel. As far as I can see, the other ways we (now) have of getting this behaviour are strictly superior.\r\n\r\nThe reasons to have that behaviour originally was that \"-debug\" was originally a bool flag that got upgraded to support multiple distinct categories, and the arg parser at the time wasn't as clever/complicated as it is today. The reason given in 11191 for doing anything was `\"0\",\"1\" are allowed in both array of <include> and <exclude>. \"0\" is ignored and \"1\" is treated same as \"all\". It is confusing, so forbid them.` so \"forbid them\" for none/0 still seems pretty reasonable.\r\n\r\n> This pull improves a lot of things here. It not only fixes broken functionality while using lesser or equal lines of code (apart from test coverage and added docs), it also adds test coverage that has been missing for a long time and improves the documentation. It would be nice to see this finally move forward, and I appreciate your reviews of it!\r\n\r\nThese commits have a bunch of extra complexity compared to dropping support for this behaviour:\r\n\r\n * Fix RPC logging behaviour -- bunch of extra code, with a requirement to keep it in sync with code in init, vs dropping the documentation\r\n * Update -debug help docs -- bunch of extra text to read documenting a special case that most people won't want\r\n * Functional test coverage for RPC -- the 0/none loop can be omitted entirely (unknown category just means previously listed categories get actioned)\r\n\r\nOther commits seem mostly fine with 0/none special casing dropped:\r\n\r\n * Unit tests for LogPrintfCategory -- fine\r\n * Functional test does not return all/none -- fine\r\n * Improve RPC logging doc and examples -- fine\r\n * Functional test coverage for -debug -- replace `-debug=0` with `-nodebug`, drop `-debugexclude=none` check\r\n * Remove unused NONE enums -- fine-ish",

They are doing pretty much the same thing, but are not trivially combinable into one function. If one is changed, it's likely that both should be (maybe a comment to that effect should be added to them -- *Edit: done*).  I therefore wanted both to be standalone functions with the same name in order that searching/git grepping returns both. *(Edit: updated this sentence to clarify.)*\r\n\r\nThat, along with how extracting that function simplifies `SetLoggingCategories` to highlight that both options are being plugged into the same code, were the motivations.\r\n",
