    "body": "The logging RPC does not work as intended and as documented in its help when `0` or `none` are passed.\r\n\r\nPer the RPC logging help:\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli help logging\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following are available as category names with special meanings:\r\n  - \"all\",  \"1\" : represent all logging categories.\r\n  - \"none\", \"0\" : even if other logging categories are specified, ignore all of them.\r\n```\r\n    \r\nThe behavior and documentation were added in #11191, but over time and extended refactoring, the behavior no longer works in master and versions 22/23/24 (the last supported versions currently) -- passing `0`/`none` has no effect.  As there was no test coverage, the regressions went uncaught.  In v24, `none` became unrecognized:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli logging '[\"none\"]'\r\nerror code: -8\r\nerror message:\r\nunknown logging category none\r\n```\r\n    \r\nDuring the same time period, passing `1` and `all` has been operational and documented. \r\n\r\nSolution: detect `none`/`0` values and add test coverage in any case, and either:\r\n    \r\n- leave the functionality out, raise with an error message if the values are passed, and update the RPC help documentation, or\r\n\r\n- fix the behavior by returning early.\r\n\r\nBoth solutions involve essentially the same code size and complexity.  Given that `all`/`1` has been operational, and that `none`/`0` has been documented and appears per the code of the original PR to have been operational, it seems preferable for consistency to support `none`/`0` in symmetry with `all`/`1` and as ACKed, intended, and documented in #11191.\r\n\r\nDone by this pull:    \r\n- add missing RPC logging logic and test coverage\r\n- update the `-debug` and `-debugexclude` config options to use the same code for consistency in behavior between them, and for consistency with the logging RPC that provides the same behavior for both `-include` and `-exclude`\r\n- improve the user-facing documentation and examples; can be tested with `./src/bitcoind -h | grep -A12 \"\\-debug=<\\|debugexclude\" && ./src/bitcoin-cli help logging`\r\n\r\nIf it is decided to backport a fix, commit `Fix RPC logging behavior when \"0\" and \"none\" values are passed` could probably suffice.",

It would be good to increase the limit soon; the fourth PR to be merged that adds a new logging category will be blocked until something like this is done.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a `TEST` category that uses the new range (`1ULL << 63`) in case there's a hidden assumption somewhere that the `BCLog::LogFlags` type is 32 bits. (Also added a test for this test category.) It also provides an example showing that the expression must be `1ULL << <shift>` for shift value 31 and beyond.",

Followup PRs could use the ALLOW_LIST flags for better documentation and error checking in the future. For example, #17493 builds on this to disallow conflicting config values. \r\n\r\nThis change was originally made as part of #17493",

          "body": "This pull request is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18 and more specifically its \"Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel\". This commit was originally authored by empact and is taken from its parent PR #25152.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nThere is an ongoing effort to decouple the `ArgsManager` used for command line parsing user-provided arguments from the libbitcoinkernel library (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25527, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25862, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26177, and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125). The `ArgsManager` is defined in `system.h`. A similar pull request extracting functionality from `system.h` has been merged in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27238.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\nNext to providing better code organization, this PR removes some reliance of the tree of libbitcoinkernel header includes on `system.h` (and thus the `ArgsManager` definition) by moving filesystem related functions out of the `system.*` files. \r\n\r\nThere is already a pair of `fs.h` / `fs.cpp` in the top-level `src/` directory. They were not combined with the files introduced here, to keep the patch cleaner and more importantly because they are often included without the utility functions. The new files are therefore named `fs_helpers` and the existing `fs` files are moved into the util directory.\r\n\r\nFurther commits splitting more functionality out of `system.h` are still in #25152 and will be submitted in separate PRs once this PR has been processed.",

A couple lines could be saved by removing the `-debugexclude` config option, but that option is practical to have, as seen by its use in our own unit/fuzz and functional test frameworks.\r\n\r\nIt seems the way forward from here is to detect `none/0` values, add test coverage and then either:\r\n    \r\n- leave the functionality out, raise with an error message if `none/0` values are passed, and update the RPC help documentation, or\r\n\r\n- simply fix the original behavior by returning early.\r\n\r\nBoth involve similar code size/complexity and the second option seems preferable.  The updated code here is about the same length as before, modulo missing test coverage and improved documentation.\r\n\r\nIn the last pushes I've updated the PR description and first commit message with this info and improved the code and tests.

This introduces compliance issues with more strict clients. There are the major misbehaviors that I found:\r\n- returning non-200 HTTP codes for RPC errors like \"Method not found\" (this is not a server error or an HTTP error)\r\n- returning both `\"error\"` and `\"result\"` fields together in a response object.\r\n- different error-handling behavior for single and batched RPC requests (batches contain errors in the response but single requests will actually throw HTTP errors)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15495 added regression tests after a discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15381 to kinda lock in our RPC behavior to preserve backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12435 was an attempt to allow strict 2.0 compliance behind a flag, but was abandoned. \r\n\r\nThe approach in this PR is not strict and preserves backwards compatibility in a familiar bitcoin-y way: all old behavior is preserved, but new rules are applied to clients that opt in. One of the rules in the [JSON RPC 2.0 spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#request_object) is that the kv pair `\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\"` must be present in the request. Well, let's just use that to trigger strict 2.0 behavior! When that kv pair is included in a request object, the [response will adhere to strict JSON-RPC 2.0 rules](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object), essentially:\r\n\r\n- always return HTTP 200 \"OK\" unless there really is a server error or malformed request\r\n- either return `\"error\"` OR `\"result\"` but never both\r\n- same behavior for single and batch requests\r\n\r\nIf this is merged next steps can be:\r\n\r\n- Refactor bitcoin-cli to always use strict 2.0\r\n- Refactor the python test framework to always use strict 2.0 for everything\r\n- Begin deprecation process for 1.0/1.1 behavior (?)\r\n\r\nIf we can one day remove the old 1.0/1.1 behavior we can clean up the rpc code quite a bit.",

          "body": "Replace `LogPrint*` functions with severity based logging functions:\r\n\r\n * `LogInfo(...)`, `LogWarning(...)`, `LogError(...)` for unconditional (uncategorised) logging (replaces `LogPrintf`)\r\n * `LogDebug(CATEGORY, ...)` and `LogTrace(CATEGORY, ...)` for conditional logging (replaces `LogPrint`)\r\n * `LogPrintLevel(CATEGORY, LEVEL, ...)` for when the level isn't known in advance, or a category needs to be added for an info/warning/error log message (mostly unchanged, but rarely needed)\r\n\r\nLogs look roughly as they do now with `LogInfo` not having an `[info]` prefix, and `LogDebug` having a `[cat]` prefix, rather than a `[cat:debug]` prefix. This removes `BCLog::Level::None` entirely -- for `LogFlags::NONE` just use `Level::Info`, for any actual category, use `Level::Debug`.\r\n\r\nAdds docs to developer-notes about when to use which level.\r\n\r\nAdds `-loglevelalways=1` option so that you get `[net:debug]`, `[all:info]`, `[all:warning]` etc, which might be helpful for automated parsing, or just if you like everything to be consistent. Defaults to off to reduce noise in the default config, and to avoid unnecessary changes on upgrades.\r\n\r\nChanges the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(CATEGORY, BCLog::Level::Info, ...)` to be logged unconditionally, rather than only being an additional optional logging level in addition to trace and debug. Does not change the behaviour of `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Debug, ...)` and `LogPrintLevel(NONE, Trace, ...)` being no-ops.",

As there was no test coverage, the regressions went uncaught.  In v24,\n`none` became unrecognized.\n\nDuring the same time period, passing `1` and `all` has been operational and documented.\n\nWe therefore need to detect none/0 values and add test coverage in any case, and either:\n\n- leave the functionality out, raise with an error message if none/0 are passed,\n  and update the RPC help documentation, or\n\n- fix the behavior by returning early.\n\nBoth solutions involve essentially the same code size and complexity.  Given\nthat all/1 has been operational, and that none/0 has been documented and appears\nto have been operational previously, it seems preferable for consistency to\nsupport none/0 in symmetry with all/1, and as ACKed, intended, and documented\nsince #11191.\n\n---\n\nThis commit therefore adds:\n\n- the missing logic to make the functionality work\n\n- a missing logging.h include header\n\n- the relevant info in the logging RPC help doc",

This also does not work with 22.x, and any earlier versions are EOL.\r\n> \r\n> If it's been broken forever (or at least is in all currently maintained releases), and no ones even noticed, we could take advantage of that, to remove some of the complexity here; do we definitely need multiple different ways of achieving the same logging toggling?\r\n\r\nHas this comment being replied to anywhere already?\r\n\r\nIt does seem like it would be pretty easy to remove this behaviour -- removing \"none\" would mean that anyone who specified it would get an error on startup, which is a good clue to fix their config. And you get the same \"actually, for this run I want to disable debugging stuff\" by adding `-nodebug` at the end (eg, on the cli) or by specifying \"-debugexclude=all\". For the logging rpc, just replace the argument with `[]` instead of adding none seems reasonable.",

Given that `all`/`1` has been\r\noperational, and that `none`/`0` has been documented and appears per the code of the original PR\r\nto have been operational, it seems preferable for consistency to support `none`/`0` in symmetry with\r\n`all`/`1` and as ACKed, intended, and documented in #11191.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> But that's trivially not true: removing the code obviously results in a lower code size\r\n\r\nNo, not if we check for the values and raise with an error message if the values are passed, with relevant test coverage. This ought to be done given that the functionality has been documented in the RPC help for around 7 years now, and perhaps also as it's not clear at what point it broke.\r\n\r\nThat is what I meant by `\"Solution: detect none/0 values and add test coverage in any case\"`, for either way requires code, test coverage, and documentation changes.  As I wrote, I prefer the route of fixing what was ACKed, intended, and documented in #11191.\r\n\r\nThis pull improves a lot of things here. It not only fixes broken functionality while using lesser or equal lines of code (apart from test coverage and added docs), it also adds test coverage that has been missing for a long time and improves the documentation. It would be nice to see this finally move forward, and I appreciate your reviews of it!",

      "body": "> ```\r\n> Both solutions involve essentially the same code size and complexity.  Given that `all`/`1` has been\r\n> operational, and that `none`/`0` has been documented and appears per the code of the original PR\r\n> to have been operational, it seems preferable for consistency to support `none`/`0` in symmetry with\r\n> `all`/`1` and as ACKed, intended, and documented in #11191.\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> > But that's trivially not true: removing the code obviously results in a lower code size\r\n> \r\n> No, not if we check for the values and raise with an error message if the values are passed, with relevant test coverage.\r\n\r\nWe already check for invalid categories and issue an error message for those. Doing the same thing for none/0 doesn't require extra code or extra test coverage.\r\n\r\n>  This ought to be done given that the functionality has been documented in the RPC help for around 7 years now, and perhaps also as it's not clear at what point it broke.\r\n\r\nFWIW, it broke in #12954 (\"This is purely a refactor with no behavior changes.\" :roll_eyes:) -- previously `getCategoryMask` evaluated all the strings, returning null if \"none\" was passed in and erroring out if any were invalid; after that PR `EnableOrDisableLogCategories` dropped the special handling of \"none\" and enabled/disabled each category as it went, which means `logging [\"net\", \"nosuchcategory\"]` changed its behaviour from just giving an error, to first enabling net logging, then giving an error.\r\n\r\n#11191 was merged 2017-11-30 and #12954 was merged 2018-05-01 so this behaviour only worked for five months if you were running master, and only for the 0.16.x release. 0.16.0 was also the first release that considered `logging` a public api (#11626).\r\n \r\n(I have an alias `git-history` which runs `git log --ignore-cr-at-eol -M -C -L${2},${3}:${1}`; so `git blame rpc/node.cpp` to get the line numbers of the function, then `git-history rpc/node.cpp 187 204` makes it easy to trace things through. At least until the refactorings get too intense. AAAA+++ excellent alias, highly recommended)\r\n\r\n> That is what I meant by `\"Solution: detect none/0 values and add test coverage in any case\"`, for either way requires code, test coverage, and documentation changes. As I wrote, I prefer the route of fixing what was ACKed, intended, and documented in #11191.\r\n\r\nWhy? The people who ACKed an old PR aren't gods, and we don't have to take their opinions at the time as gospel. As far as I can see, the other ways we (now) have of getting this behaviour are strictly superior.\r\n\r\nThe reasons to have that behaviour originally was that \"-debug\" was originally a bool flag that got upgraded to support multiple distinct categories, and the arg parser at the time wasn't as clever/complicated as it is today. The reason given in 11191 for doing anything was `\"0\",\"1\" are allowed in both array of <include> and <exclude>. \"0\" is ignored and \"1\" is treated same as \"all\". It is confusing, so forbid them.` so \"forbid them\" for none/0 still seems pretty reasonable.\r\n\r\n> This pull improves a lot of things here. It not only fixes broken functionality while using lesser or equal lines of code (apart from test coverage and added docs), it also adds test coverage that has been missing for a long time and improves the documentation. It would be nice to see this finally move forward, and I appreciate your reviews of it!\r\n\r\nThese commits have a bunch of extra complexity compared to dropping support for this behaviour:\r\n\r\n * Fix RPC logging behaviour -- bunch of extra code, with a requirement to keep it in sync with code in init, vs dropping the documentation\r\n * Update -debug help docs -- bunch of extra text to read documenting a special case that most people won't want\r\n * Functional test coverage for RPC -- the 0/none loop can be omitted entirely (unknown category just means previously listed categories get actioned)\r\n\r\nOther commits seem mostly fine with 0/none special casing dropped:\r\n\r\n * Unit tests for LogPrintfCategory -- fine\r\n * Functional test does not return all/none -- fine\r\n * Improve RPC logging doc and examples -- fine\r\n * Functional test coverage for -debug -- replace `-debug=0` with `-nodebug`, drop `-debugexclude=none` check\r\n * Remove unused NONE enums -- fine-ish",

They are doing pretty much the same thing, but are not trivially combinable into one function. If one is changed, it's likely that both should be (maybe a comment to that effect should be added to them -- *Edit: done*).  I therefore wanted both to be standalone functions with the same name in order that searching/git grepping returns both. *(Edit: updated this sentence to clarify.)*\r\n\r\nThat, along with how extracting that function simplifies `SetLoggingCategories` to highlight that both options are being plugged into the same code, were the motivations.\r\n",
