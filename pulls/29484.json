    "body": "Doesn't depend on #29263, but it's really only relevant after that one's merged.\r\n\r\nThis removes the only remaining autoconf macro in our serialization code (after #29263), so it can now be used trivially and safely out-of-tree.\r\n\r\n~Our code does not currently contain any concepts, but couldn't find any discussion or docs about avoiding them. I guess we'll see if this blows up our c-i.~\r\nEdit: Ignore this. ajtowns pointed out that we're already using a few concepts.\r\n\r\nThis was introduced in #13580. Please check my logic on this as I'm unable to test on a SmartOS system. Even better would be a confirmation from someone who can build there.",
