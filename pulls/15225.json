    "body": "Currently the Receive button in the GUI is displayed enabled or disabled by the initial state of the wallet when the wallet is first loaded. The button is only enabled or disabled depending on whether the disable private keys flag is set when the wallet is loaded. However, future changes to the wallet means that this initial state and check may no longer be accurate. #14938 introduces empty wallets which do not have private keys. An empty wallet that is loaded should have the Receive button disabled, and then it should become enabled once `sethdseed` is used so that a keypool can be generated and new keys generated. Likewise, with #14075, a wallet can be loaded with no keypool initially, so the button should be disabled. Later, public keys can be imported into the keypool, at which time the button should become enabled. When the keypool runs out again (no new keys are generated as the keypool only consists of imports), the button should become disabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it so that the button becomes enabled and disabled as the keypool state changes. The check for whether to enable or disable the receive button has changed to checking whether it is possible to get new keys. It now checks for whether the wallet has an HD seed and, if not, whether the private keys are disabled. When an action happens which would make it possible for a new address to be retrieved or make it possible for a no more addresses to be retrieved, a signal is emitted which has the GUI recheck the conditions for the Receive button. These actions are setting a new HD seed, topping up the keypool, retrieving a key from the keypool, and returning a key to the keypool.",

This flag is set at creation, and then unset when the wallet is no longer blank. A wallet becomes non-blank when a HD seed is set or anything is imported. The main change to create a blank wallet is primarily taken from #14938.\r\n\r\nAlso with this, the term \"blank wallet\" is used instead of \"empty wallet\" to avoid confusion with wallets that have balance which would also be referred to as \"empty\".\r\n\r\nThis is built on top of #15225 in order to fix GUI issues.",

That's already done at the wallet level `WalletModel::canGetAddresses()`, and I'm fine with renaming the other stuff later. E.g. `handleKeypoolChanged` -> `handleFreshAddressAvailable` / `handleCanGetAddresses`.\r\n\r\nSee inline feedback on 2795d95bfc6810fd91e6f94943c93ec247b25662",
