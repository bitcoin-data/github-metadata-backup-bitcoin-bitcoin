    "body": "In order to cope gracefully with `Log*()` calls that are invoked prior to logging being fully configured (indicated by calling `StartLogging()` we buffer early log messages in `m_msgs_before_open`. This has a couple of minor issues:\r\n\r\n * if there are many such log messages the buffer can become arbitrarily large; this can be a problem for users of libkernel that might not wish to worry about logging at all, and as a result never invoke `StartLogging()`\r\n * early log messages are formatted before the formatting options are configured, leading to inconsistent output\r\n\r\nFix those issues by buffering the log info prior to formatting it, and setting a limit on the size of the buffer (dropping the oldest lines, and reporting the number of lines skipped).\r\n\r\nAlso adds some thread safety annotations, and the ability to invoke `LogInstance().DisableLogging()` if you want to disable logging entirely, for a minor efficiency improvement.",
