If any (or all) onion slots remain after that operation, they are then allocated to protect localhost peers, or a minimum of 2 localhost peers in the case that no onion slots remain and 2 or more onion peers were protected, sorted as before by longest uptime.\r\n\r\nThis patch also adds test coverage for the longest uptime, localhost, and onion peer eviction protection logic to build on the welcome initial unit testing of #20477.\r\n\r\nSuggest reviewing the commits that move code with `colorMoved = dimmed-zebra` and `colorMovedWs = allow-indentation-change`.\r\n\r\nCloses #11537.",
