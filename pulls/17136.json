      "body": "@laanwj I try to separate so that fuzzers stressing a specific subsystem go in to the same PR. \r\n\r\nThe reason I do that is that if the fuzzers uncover potential problems in our code base the fuzzing PR might need attention not only from `test/` maintainers but also from experts on the specific subsystem being stressed.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a good example: this PR adds a PSBT fuzzer which means that an expert on that part of the code base (such as @achow101?) might want to take a look at any issues the fuzzer uncovers.\r\n\r\nSince I submitted this PR the PSBT fuzzer in this PR

submitted a Miniscript fuzzer (#17129) which means that Miniscript expert @sipa might want to take a look at the potential issues it manages to hit (heap out-of-bounds read in `Node::CalcOps` and assertion failure in `ComputeType`).\r\n\r\nIn summary I think it is a good idea to group related fuzzers in to the same PR.\r\n\r\nOTOH I'm not entirely convinced that it is a good idea to group unrelated fuzzers (such as for example the PSBT fuzzers and Miniscript fuzzers) in to the same PR in order to keep the PR list short :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/src/psbt.cpp
