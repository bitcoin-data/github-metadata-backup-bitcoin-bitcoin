    "body": "Summary\r\n====\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the RPC whitelisting feature requested in #12248. RPC Whitelists help enforce application policies for services being built on top of Bitcoin Core (e.g., your Lightning Node maybe shouldn't be adding new peers). The aim of this PR is not to make it advisable to connect your Bitcoin node to arbitrary services, but to reduce risk and prevent unintended access.\r\n\r\nUsing RPC Whitelists\r\n====\r\nThe way it works is you specify (in your bitcoin.conf) configurations such as\r\n\r\n```\r\nrpcauth=user1:4cc74397d6e9972e5ee7671fd241$11849357f26a5be7809c68a032bc2b16ab5dcf6348ef3ed1cf30dae47b8bcc71\r\nrpcauth=user2:181b4a25317bff60f3749adee7d6bca0$d9c331474f1322975fa170a2ffbcb176ba11644211746b27c1d317f265dd4ada\r\nrpcauth=user3:a6c8a511b53b1edcf69c36984985e$13cfba0e626db19061c9d61fa58e712d0319c11db97ad845fa84517f454f6675\r\nrpcwhitelist=user1:getnetworkinfo\r\nrpcwhitelist=user2:getnetworkinfo,getwalletinfo, getbestblockhash\r\nrpcwhitelistdefault=0\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow user1 can only call getnetworkinfo, user2 can only call getnetworkinfo or getwalletinfo, while user3 can still call all RPCs. \r\n\r\nIf any rpcwhitelist is set, act as if all users are subject to whitelists unless rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 0. If rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 1 and no rpcwhitelist is set, act as if all users are subject to whitelists.\r\n\r\n\r\nReview Request\r\n=====\r\nIn addition to normal review, would love specific review from someone working on LN (e.g., @ roasbeef) and someone working on an infrastructure team at an exchange (e.g., @ jimpo) to check that this works well with their system.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThe rpc list is spelling sensitive -- whitespace is stripped though. Spelling errors fail towards the RPC call being blocked, which is safer.\r\n\r\nIt was unclear to me if HTTPReq_JSONRPC is the best function to patch this functionality into, or if it would be better to place it in exec or somewhere else.\r\n\r\nIt was also unclear to me if it would be preferred to cache the whitelists on startup or parse them on every RPC as is done with multiUserAuthorized. I opted for the cached approach as I thought it was a bit cleaner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Work\r\n=====\r\n\r\nIn a future PR, I would like to add an inheritance scheme. This seemed more controversial so I didn't want to include that here. Inheritance semantics are tricky, but it would also make these whitelists easier to read.\r\n\r\nIt also might be good to add a `getrpcwhitelist` command to facilitate permission discovery.\r\n\r\nTests\r\n=====\r\nThanks to @ emilengler for adding tests for this feature. The tests cover all cases except for where `rpcwhitelistdefault=1` is used, given difficulties around testing with the current test framework.\r\n\r\n",

For more commercial users, we'd just use different instances of bitcoin-core itself. \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe PRC permission feature I'm more interested in is a lot more high-level; like applying spending limits. What I would like to do is be able to store say 300 BTC in my wallet, but never allow it drop below 250 BTC (by a particular RPC user). This way I could have only 50 BTC of \"risk\" (e.g. in case my service was hacked) but could benefit from having 300 BTC worth of coins (so coin-selection can do a much better job)",

      "body": "I support adding ACLs and all that, so concept ACK.\r\n\r\nThe implementation here is problematic though. In a whitelisting approach everything should be disabled by default. This does the opposite: in this PR users have access to all RPCs by default. Adding a whitelist policy for a user implicitly restricts access to other ACLs, which is very confusing. If I am $COMPANY and I add a new engineer to the team, it is going to be very bad if I create an rpcauth for the user without remembering to also set up their ACLs. The default behavior in this situation should be safe, i.e. deny by default if any policy is defined.\r\n\r\nThere's a huge range here from really complex authorization schemes to really simple things, but I would prefer something that has at least basic steps towards a real roles/ACL system. At the minimum I think this means there should be a way to declare a default list of ACLs, and then whitelists would expand on that.",

If a user is marked rpcwhitelistroot, they have all RPCs enabled. If a user is marked rpcwhitelist=<user>:blah, then they have blah.\r\n\r\nOr, we can make it such that if any rpcwhitelist is set, all users default to having an empty whitelist.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you think this is a good tradeoff of complexity/dtrt? Which do you prefer?\r\n\r\n\r\n@promag \r\nThe other detail (in a forthcoming patch) is that if rpcwhitelist is set multiple times for a single user, it should do the intersection of the specification (e.g., monotonically smaller whitelist) rather than the union. In cases where conflicting settings have been passed, it is safer to do less.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@JeremyRubin I would add both. I guess my point is that if you need permissions at all you probably also want the ability to enable some kind of deny-by-default policy, to safeguard against a situation where you accidentally forget to lock down an account. You generally don't want to give your software engineers root access on production machines by default, and by the same token I don't think you would want to give people with bitcoind access root by default.\r\n\r\nThe way I imagine a typical setup would be something like this (ignore the made up syntax):\r\n```ini\r\n# Default permissions are for a bunch of read only rpcs\r\nrpcallowed = getblock,getblockchaininfo\r\n\r\n# Alice has the default permissions, plus stuff to admin the network\r\nrpcallowed.alice = addnode,clearbanned,listbanned\r\n\r\n# Bob has the default permissions, plus some basic access to the wallet\r\nrpcallowed.bob = getbalance,getwalletinfo,getnewaddress\r\n\r\n# Carol is an admin, she can access everything\r\nrpcallowed.carol = !all\r\n```\r\nAnd semantics something like this:\r\n * If there are no `rpcallowed` lines at all then everyone can access everything, just like how bitcoin works today\r\n * If you set `rpcallowed.alice` (Alice's list) but forget to set `rpcallowed` (the default list) then it should deny by default (maybe with a special error message attached to the RPC warning about the bad configuration)\r\n\r\nAdmittedly there is an area ripe for feature creep, but I think the above would be relatively simple to implement and good enough for a lot of cases.",

      "body": "Second idea that's much more crazy/complex. I'll throw it out there though.\r\n\r\nYAML documents have a syntax to reference other elements, which are really useful for these kinds of things. You can construct a few objects in your config and reference them elsewhere, which allows you to come up with some pseduo-role system:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\npolicies:\r\n  # a default policy\r\n  - policy: &default\r\n      - getblock\r\n      - getblockchaininfo\r\n      - getblockcount\r\n\r\n  # network admin policy\r\n  - policy: &networkadmin\r\n      - addnode\r\n      - clearbanned\r\n      - getpeerinfo\r\n\r\nusers:\r\n  # alice has default plus network admin\r\n  - name: alice\r\n    policies:\r\n      - *default\r\n      - *networkadmin\r\n\r\n  # bob just has default policies\r\n  - name: bob\r\n    policies:\r\n      - *default\r\n\r\n  # syntax idea 1 for full access\r\n  - name: carol\r\n    admin: true\r\n\r\n  # syntax idea 2 for full access, !all is implicitly defined\r\n  - name: dave\r\n    policies: [*all]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `&obj` syntax introduces a name for a reference, and then `*obj` means \"substitute the literal value for obj here\". I'm not sure how it works in C++ YAML libraries, but the ones I've used in Python do the reference expansion within the YAML library. This makes it so your code can just work with dumb lists of objects, since they never see the object references.\r\n\r\nThe obvious drawback is that this would require linking against a YAML library. You could mitigate that by only having the user ACL list be in a YAML lib, so only users who actually want these feature would need to enable the YAML parser.",

(#12763) made it much more secure with restricting access. However the connection level side is still insecure as it works through plain HTTP.\r\n# The bitcoin-cli problem\r\nThe reason why I am opening this PR in this early state is because it seems like bitcoin-cli will need a rewrite powered by libcurl as libevent has not really good SSL support on the client side (other ideas and help is most welcome). As such a change is major I already wanna ask for `r\"Concept (N)?ACK\"` so that such a major change won't be worthless.\r\n# OpenSSL again\r\nThis PR adds OpenSSL again. I would like if @fanquake could review the first two commits as they mostly consist of reverts from two of his PRs (#17265 and #17165) \r\n# Testing\r\nIt is already testable. Please be sure to have OpenSSL installed on your system! (Debian: `apt install openssl libssl-dev`)\r\nYou should also have `cURL` installed.\r\n**The actual testing**\r\n1. Generate an SSL cert with \r\n`openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert`.\r\nIf you have problems with the generation, you can download mine. (DO NOT USE THEM PRODUCTIVELY AS THE PRIVATE KEY IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE). [Download here](https://www.emilengler.com/openssl.zip)\r\n2. Compile my branch\r\n3. Start bitcoind with\r\n```\r\n./bitcoind --server=1 --rpcuser=u --rpcpassword=p --regtest --ssl=1 --sslcert=/home/emil/openssl/server.cert --sslkey=/home/emil/openssl/server.key\r\n```\r\n *(Please adjust the paths according to yours)*\r\n4. Do the SSL request (Enter `p` as password)!\r\n```\r\ncurl --user u -k --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getbestblockhash\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' https://127.0.0.1:18443/\r\n```\r\n5. You should see that you just made a successful HTTPS request\r\n# [Demo (Youtube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBXl33XeDP4&feature=youtu.be)",

Otherwise, stop summing and don't show the fee. For `analyzepsbt`, return that the next role is the Creator since the Creator needs to remake the transaction to be valid.",

          "body": "Recently I was discussing how to lock down access on a Bitcoin node with @jlin816 and we came up with 2 features that would be useful.\r\n\r\nProposing 2 features:\r\n\r\n1. rpc.conf file, which contains a list of enabled RPCs. No other RPCs should be callable. rpc.conf should be loaded at startup. The default file is all of them. Can also be passed in as command line args perhaps.\r\n1. a compile time flag file whitelist. The default file is all of them. This eases the production of custom builds where it would be impossible for the RPC to be called even if rpc.conf is not correctly set.\r\n\r\nIt's not high priority, but having this would make it easier to produce bitcoin node binaries for high security environments.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any thoughts or reservations on the above design before @jlin816 takes a crack at it (for her first contribution). Is this functionality already possible without external proxy?",
