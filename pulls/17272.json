    "body": "This proposed policy change would allow multiple OP_RETURN outputs per transaction, the Bitcoin protocol allows for multiple of these opcodes per transaction but the current policy does not. We are seeing an inefficient use of OP_RETURN for systems that rely on this feature. For example, an asset layer solution making use of OP_RETURN currently has to create multiple transactions when sending to multiple recipients.\r\n\r\nThere are several regular sources of these types of transactions on the network making up a significant proportion of daily transaction, OmniLayer, one successful and popular asset layer, on the 21st Oct 2019 was responsible for 8% of transactions that day (Omni 28,313 TXs [[1](#-1)] / Bitcoin 351,632 TXs [2]). Allowing multiple OP_RETURN opcodes would enable asset layer solutions to move multiple assets to multiple recipients in a single transaction, this would result in an overall reduced data size for the movement of those assets reducing transaction load on the network.\r\n\r\nThe original Pull Request to add OP_RETURN linked below bemusingly set the fail reason for multiple instances of it to “mucho-data”, the opposite is now true, single OP_RETURN per transaction only result in more data, not less.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2738/files\r\n\r\nA service bit could be added to show whether a node would accept and relay a transaction with multiple OP_RETURN opcodes, such transactions would then only be relayed to nodes indicating support. If this change warrants such a thing I’d be happy to update this PR to include it.\r\n\r\n1. https://omniexplorer.info/\r\n2. https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html#3m\r\n",

I would expect assets to just use coloured coins...\r\n\r\nTwo reasons: first, colored coins can only perform explicit transactions, such as sends of assets from one address to another.  They cannot support *implicit* actions, like sending an asset from a recipient in response to a single transaction from a sender (this would include crowdsale/ICO-like functionality as well as decentralized exchange capability).  Second, colored coins using a particular number of satoshis in an output as an identifier are always at risk of being inadvertently destroyed by non-compliant clients/wallets that receive them and don't recognize the importance of that output being preserved.",

They cannot support implicit actions, like sending an asset from a recipient in response to a single transaction from a sender (this would include crowdsale/ICO-like functionality as well as decentralized exchange capability).\r\n> \r\n> @CraigSellars Bitcoin transactions don't _have_ an identified sender.\r\n> \r\n> > Second, colored coins using a particular number of satoshis in an output as an identifier are always at risk of being inadvertently destroyed by non-compliant clients/wallets that receive them and don't recognize the importance of that output being preserved.\r\n> \r\n> That's no more or less true than using OP_RETURN.\r\n> \r\n> Again, where's the BIP? That should hopefully make a lot of questions go away...\r\n> \r\n> > Each OP_RETURN output is being paid for (fees), so there is no reason to limit the amount of such outputs.Each OP_RETURN output is being paid for (fees), so there is no reason to limit the amount of such outputs.\r\n> \r\n> @Relaxo143 This is nonsense. Fees do not pay for outputs or transactions, they merely bribe miners (who do not carry the burden) to include them in blocks. These policy spam filters exist to help prevent spam _regardless_ of the fee included.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr  What is spam is highly subjective. The author of this PR doesn't think OP_RETURN outputs are spam and thus proposes to make them standard (more than 1 in a tx). This will actually save blockchain space. If a person has to or wants to use OP_RETURN and needs 5 outputs for their data they'll have to compose 5 different TXs with at least one input. Inputs take up more space than outputs so by leaving >1 OP_RETURN outputs non-standard we enforce higher blockchain usage. there is no reason why we should limit them in my opinion. Just like batch sending is possible with multiple outputs (addresses), batch data embedding should be possible too.",

Fees do not pay for outputs or transactions, they merely bribe miners (who do not carry the burden) to include them in blocks. These policy spam filters exist to help prevent spam _regardless_ of the fee included.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"burden\" here? If arbitrary data is stored in the blockchain without using OP_RETURN (e.g. by just misusing the 20-byte hash in a P2PKH output, which can't even be prevented), the burden is actually much higher since it has to be kept in the UTXO set forever. Why is exactly _one_ output of OP_RETURN considered as non-spam, but more than one is?",
