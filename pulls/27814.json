Better to just support negation consistently. There are few options which really can't accept missing values and where DISALLOW_NEGATION makes sense, but this isn't common. (In general, I'd say IsArgSet function and DISALLOW_NEGATION flags are heavily misused and it's usually good to steer away from using them.)\r\n",
