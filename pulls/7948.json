    "body": "This adds the hash of the first block of the LOCKED_IN period for a given deployment (when the deployment is LOCKED_IN or ACTIVE) to the `bip9_softforks` data of the `getblockchaininfo` RPC.\n\nI implemented this as a simple scan through the already existing map values to make this change easy to review. I looked at adding an array to the version bits cache struct and then populating it from the `THRESHOLD_LOCKED_IN` case in `AbstractThresholdConditionChecker::GetStateFor`, but that would have meant more refactoring.\n\nThe motivation for this is that I was researching some forking going on on testnet3 and one of the first questions I had was, \"When were the BIP9 forks locking in and activating?\" This patch provides the info necessary to begin digging around and figuring that out. This provides the lock in block. Take its height and then mentally add 2016 to get the ACTIVE block height etc... This was the simplest change to get the info I was after.\n",

      "body": "@pinheadmz I received your question: \"Are you sure this offset is necessary? In regtest mode on my machine, segwit status is \"started\" on block 143, but this RPC call returns \"since\": 144 even though that block height has not been generated yet.\"\r\n\r\nAnswer: When you start a fresh regtest node (regtest uses a retarget interval of 144 blocks), you have 1 block @ height 0 (the genesis block) and the bip9 softfork \"segwit\" is \"defined\".\r\nGenerate 142 blocks, segwit still defined.\r\nGenerate 1 segwit is now started.\r\nSo, we've generated 143 blocks and have 144 total. That is one retarget interval of blocks. When we have 144 blocks in the chain (a whole interval) BIP 9 can know what status the next block will be. getblockchaininfo.since is defined as the \"height of the first block to which the status applies\". Height 144 is the 145th block in the chain.\r\nFrom [BIP 9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki): \"Given that the state for a specific block/deployment combination is completely determined by its ancestry before the current retarget period (i.e. up to and including its ancestor with height block.height - 1 - (block.height % 2016))\". So, at height 143, we know what the status will be for height 144 and it'll be the new status of \"started\" which is the \"height of the first block to which the status applies\".",

Else, pindexPrev won't become NULL before previousPeriodParent does (which is what matters).\n\nFor example, consider a regtest network, where period=144, and our tip is at height 143 (i.e.- we're calling this before generating the block for height 144 and pindexPrev points to the tip at height=143), and we're now in STARTED (because the MTP time threshold was met), then line 108 leaves pindexPrev pointing at block with height=143 (idempotent when called for the first block in a period because pindexPrev already points at the correct block). Line 110 makes previousPeriodParent == NULL, but that is checked for by the loop (and only as a slight optimization as NULL could be passed into GetStateFor safely with the same effect).\n",
