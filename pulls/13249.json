          "body": "This commit is *almost* a move-only* and a fairly straightforward refactor which moves the p2p logic when a transaction received over the wire is accepted or rejected into their own functions instead of being embedded directly in ProcessMessages().\r\n\r\nMotivation: as a follow-up to #12934, I'm working on putting mempool acceptance behind a similar type of asynchronous queue. In order to do that, ATMP response logic in p2p needs to be cleanly separated out into separate functions. \r\n\r\n*Note that this commit introduces one behavior change: Currently, if -promiscuousmempool is set (only allowed on regtest and testnet), it is possible for AcceptToMemoryPool() to return true, but for the CValidationState() to contain DoS points if the transaction failed validation with policy standard script flags but then passed with promiscuous flags. This will cause you to ban the peer who sent the transaction. This commit fixes this behavior by reseting the validation state in that one situation.",

It matches any single character that sorts between the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's collating sequence and character set. For example, in the default C locale, `[a-d]` is equivalent to `[abcd]`. Many  locales sort characters in dictionary order, and in these locales `[a-d]` is typically not equivalent to `[abcd]`; it might be equivalent to `[aBbCcDd]`, for example. To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by setting the `LC_ALL` environment variable to the value C.\r\n\r\nContext: [Locale issue found when reviewing #13450](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13450/files#r194877736)\r\n",

The reason that I use macros is that developers might not want to pass second parameter `utf8` everytime when they call `string` or create `path` objects.\r\n\r\nI tried to find all `string` methods and convert them to `u8string` except for external api calls. Also tried to convert explicit or implicit `path` to `u8path`. Tell me if you find something that I missed.\r\n\r\nRequired: bitcoin-core/leveldb#18\r\n\r\nSee #13787 for travis run result\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: The user must change their config file to be utf-8 encoded if the file contains any non-ascii characters in it. Before 0.18, they are read as ansi-encoded characters on Windows.\r\n--",

          "body": "This implements a layer around an immutable tx pool. The layer can be seen as a temporary throw-away shell that provides the same interface as `CTxMemPool`. Its primary purpose right now is to be passed into ATMP while testing acceptance of several (potentially depending) transaction and then to be discarded.\r\n\r\nOne use case could be to determine if smart contracts that are set up with multiple txs would be accepted by current consensus and policy rules.\r\n\r\nIn the future it could be extended to support recursive wrapping of layers or a way to commit changes that happened in the layer to the underlying pool or layer. Furthermore, it could be extended to be revivable after changes to the underlying layer happened. (As opposed to be single-use)",
