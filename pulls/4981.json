    "body": "As an ongoing effort to break out script verification. I hope this doesn't conflict with @sipa's or @jtimon's next steps.\n\nThis work moves the logic for writing custom core classes to scripts out of CScript. Those classes can describe how their data should be written to a script, and CScript does so without further knowledge.\n\nPlease ignore the entire PR's diffstat while reviewing as it won't be at all helpful. Individual commits will make much more sense.\n\nAlso, CScriptBinaryData is a pretty terrible name but I couldn't come up with anything better. Suggestions welcome.\n",

It'd defeat the purpose to depend on Core for the parsing. This seems like a reasonable place to make an exception, but I understand the case against as well.\n\nutilstrencodings.h itself isn't a terrible dependency, as it only depends on tinyformat. I suppose we could call that part of our \"shipped\" script lib, but it'd be a shame for such a small thing.\n\nThe alternative would be using HexStr(script.begin(),script.end()) everywhere in Core that currently uses script.ToString(), but that would be really ugly.\n",

      "body": "@theuni Ok if a hexstr is really, truly, the only thing you need in the script lib, I'm fine with making an exception. This is trivially simple code.\n\nOne other remark though. The old implementation of that function is:\n\n```\nif (vch.size() <= 4)\n    return strprintf(\"%d\", CScriptNum(vch).getint());\nelse\n    return HexStr(vch);\n```\n\nThis makes sure that normal scriptnums are printed as numbers instead of hex strings, which people have come to expect. The new one always shows a hex string.\n\nAt least move the implementation to the implementation file instead of the header (then the header doesn't have to depend on tinyformat/strencodings/... even if you use it, and the library doesn't have to export those headers).\n",

Though to be fair, future reorg work will only cause more churn, so I suppose that doesn't really help my case :)\n\nMuch of https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/4e4ae57fd28ef0a191ccd8f88192ea53daed9d3f could be moved out to a new PR that likely wouldn't conflict with anyone else's work here, but the other changes would for sure.\n\nAs a quick thought, for those of us working on reorg/break-out, we could work in a separate repo and PR back to mainline in stages, more in-line with a git maintainership workflow. Then we'd be working together rather than against eachother. @jtimon @sipa interested, or more trouble than it's worth?\n",

          "title": "Allow compiling bitcoind as a shared library: libbitcoind.so",
          "body": "We are all aware of alternative implementations of the bitcoin protocol. I've even helped personally implement [two](https://github.com/indutny/bcoin) of [them](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore). There is an obvious fundamental problem with all alternative implementations that I'm sure everyone here sees: They're not bug-for-bug compatible with Satoshi's original implementation.\n\nAs we see more and more production platforms ([BitPay](https://bitpay.com/), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Circle](https://www.circle.com/), [Blockchain](https://blockchain.info/), etc.) that _absolutely_ depend on the adamant stability of their platform, with **so** much at stake, it is imperative that their backend protocol implementation be 100% compatible with the original protocol. That is non-trivial, and maybe even impossible to do with an alternative implementation.\n\nPlatforms and services like this are forced to use bitcoind as a backend on their servers if they want stability. Using just bitcoind with RPC calls has a number of limitations and hurdles.\n\n---\n\nThis pull request alters the autoconf files to allow something like this:\n\n``` bash\n$ git clone git://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git\n$ cd bitcoin\n$ ./autogen.sh\n$ ./configure --enable-daemonlib\n$ make\n...\n$ ls -la src/libbitcoind.so\n```\n\nAny program, or binding for a platform (python, php, node.js, ruby, etc), can now link to the official bitcoin implementation. Luckily bitcoind decided not to use `static` functions and put function templates in every header file, which means linkage to any function in bitcoind should be fairly easily as every function is exposed to the program which links to it.\n## An Example\n\n``` bash\n# Write a program which links to libbitcoind\necho '#include \"bitcoind.h\"' > my_program.cc\necho '#include \"...\"' >> my_program.cc\necho 'extern bool AppInit(int, char **);' >> my_program.cc\necho 'int main(int argc, char **argv) {' >> my_program.cc\necho '  return AppInit(argc, argv) ? 0 : 1;' >> my_program.cc\necho '}' >> my_program.cc\n\n# Compile our program\ngcc -I$HOME/bitcoin/src -I$HOME/bitcoin/src/obj \\\n  -I$HOME/bitcoin/src/config -I$HOME/bitcoin/src/leveldb/include \\\n  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -g -O2 -fexceptions -frtti -fpermissive \\\n  -o my_program my_program.cc \\\n  -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem -lboost_program_options \\\n  -lboost_thread -lboost_chrono -lssl -lcrypto \\\n  $HOME/bitcoin/src/libbitcoind.so\n\n# Start our process\n./my_program -server -daemon\n\n# Bitcoind logs should be spitting out\ntail -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log\n```\n\nA contrived example: Obviously this capability would most likely be used to link to different platforms' modules/bindings with that binding being dynamically loaded into python's/node.js'/php's/ruby's memory.\n### A More Complete Example\n\nAt BitPay, I have written a fully fledged node.js binding which links to `libbitcoind.so` and can do almost anything an alternative bitcoin implementation can do. It is called [bitcoind.js](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcoind.js).\n\nFeel free to examine the [documentation](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcoind.js/blob/master/README.md#documentation) and [source](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcoind.js/blob/master/src/bitcoindjs.cc) to see the actual [benefits](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcoind.js/blob/master/lib/bitcoind.js) something like this would provide.\n## What this PR does:\n- Moves `main()` out of `bitcoind.cpp` and into `bitcoind_main.cpp`. Moves all includes and variables out of `bitcoind.cpp` and into `bitcoind.h` so it can be included by both `bitcoind.cpp` and `bitcoind_main.cpp` if necessary.\n- Exposes two or three functions in header files which will be useful for different platforms linking to libbitcoind. This required creating an `rpcwallet.h` header file.\n- Adds `--enable-daemonlib` argument to `configure.ac` - this enables `-fPIC` for all object files instead of -`fPIE`. It also sets an AM conditional which is checked for in the automake file. Also resets `-fvisibility` to its default.\n- When compiling the library, automake makes use of this `AM_CONDITIONAL` such that targets are overridden by one `all:` target compiling the library, and bitcoin-qt(+tests) is ignored.\n- Now that all object files can be compiled as position independent code, the custom `Makefile` target I've added (vanilla Make syntax - I'm sure automake can do something fancier and compile a shared object through the help of libtool, but I couldn't manage to make it work) can link these object files together into `libbitcoind.so` with `-shared -fPIC`.\n## Issues and potential annoyances:\n\nI figure I'll address these since I'm fairly certain these questions will be raised.\n- If you want to compile bitcoind or bitcoin-qt, the object files compiled for libbitcoind are essentially useless since they're not `-fPIE`. You have to clean and recompile for scratch.\n- Since bitcoind was never structured like a proper library, it's essentially one big mess: there is logging and arg parsing all over the place. A coder's best bet is to write their own stripped down version of `AppInit2()` which starts up the net.cpp threads and listens for `RequestShutdown`, eventually joining all threads. Currently, bitcoind.js simply starts up `AppInit2()` on a separate thread.\n- Name Mangling: Node.js module bindings are written in C++. Lua and Ruby bindings are canonically written in C, which means in order to use libbitcoind without guessing bizarre function names, functions will have to be exposed with `extern \"C\"` on non-OO functions to force the stopping of mangled names. Of course, the workaround would be for Lua and Ruby users to write a C++ wapper and then link to them from their C binding.\n- Internal API: When I first started writing bitcoind.js, I forked bitcoin v0.9.0 and turned it into a shared library. Once I rebased it onto the latest master, a lot of functions had changed and took differen params, a lot of classes were changed or added. I had to rewrite several functions. Any program depending on libbitcoind.so will have to deal with this as bitcoind is developed since it is not developed like a library.\n- The Build: I'm sure there's a slicker way to compile this as an `.so`. I'm really not an Automake guru. I've fooled around a bit with the build here, but at the end of the day, someone smarter than me could probably do a better job at writing a `src/Makefile.daemon.include`.\n  \n  The `noinst_LIBRARIES` libraries and other magical features of automake are simply ignored when `--enable-daemonlib` is used. The .mm.o target compiles all the object files necessary to link them up into a shared library with a vanilla make target.\n- Platforms: I'm not terribly familiar with OSX, but right now, I've only tested this build on Linux (Arch). I've had two friends try to build on OSX with unfortunate results that were apparently common in trying to compile bitcoind on OSX. I'm still unsure if this will work with Macintoshes. I have even less of an idea of how windows works compared to OSX.  Maybe it could be made into a `.dll` somehow.\n## The Score\n\nThere may be better ways of doing this, but I think if the future of bitcoin and the bitcoin world is to be a bright one, bitcoind _needs_ to be reshaped into an optional library in some form. I don't only speak on behalf of my employer here ([BitPay](https://bitpay.com/)), even though I'm sure we all agree. This also happens to be my personal opinion on the matter.\n\nI open this to discussion. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make Bitcoin into a library.\n",

Then that was dropped and serialization was done on a per-type basis. Then that was dropped, and it was templated so that it's all done the same way.\n\nSo I suppose this should go one of two ways, rather than the hybrid that it is now\n- keep the class, which allows for implicit conversion from anything with begin/end iterators. That would mean that we could drop nearly all of b25d5f0dd531aaf5618f077c646afa556f6277ad, which should've been done when it was templatized.\n- Make it a function, and use as in b25d5f0dd531aaf5618f077c646afa556f6277ad.\n\nI really don't care either way.

I see the merit in being explicit, and I see the merit in letting CScript handle whatever comes its way.\n\nI see merit in it, and I wouldn't care either way if this was, for example, GUI code. But for consensus-critical code it's too dangerous to just \"handle everything that comes its way in _some_ way\". I like to be explicit and clear in what gets handled how and what the representation is. And to have compile-time errors when something is fishy. Remember the fun a while ago with `std::vector<unsigned char>(a.begin,e.end())` with `a` being a `std::vector<int>()` \"just working\" by truncating each value?\n",
