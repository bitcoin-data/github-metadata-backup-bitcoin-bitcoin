    "body": "The method `CWallet::CreateTransaction` currently returns several values in the form of out-parameters:\r\n* the actual newly created transaction (`CTransactionRef& tx`)\r\n* its required fee (`CAmount& nFeeRate`)\r\n* the position of the change output (`int& nChangePosInOut`) -- as the name suggests, this is both an in- and out-param\r\n\r\nBy returning these values in an optional structure (which returns no value a.k.a. `std::nullopt` if an error occured), the interfaces is shorter, cleaner (requested change position is now in-param and can be passed by value) and callers don't have to create dummy variables for results that they are not interested in. \r\n\r\nNote that the names of the replaced out-variables were kept in `CreateTransactionInternal` to keep the diff minimal. Also, the fee calculation data (`FeeCalculation& fee_calc_out`) would be another candidate to put into the structure, but `FeeCalculation` is currently an opaque data type in the wallet interface and I think it should stay that way.\r\n\r\nAs a potential follow-up, I think it would make sense to also do the same refactoring for `CWallet::FundTransaction`, which has a very similar parameter structure.\r\n\r\nSuggested by laanwj in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20588#issuecomment-739838428.",

In future I suggest we can remove `chain` from `CWallet` constructor.\r\n\r\nThe second commit is based on be164f9cf89b123f03b926aa980996919924ee64 from #15719 (thanks ryanofsky)\r\n\r\ncc ryanofsky achow101 ",

          "body": "During coin selection, there are various places where we need to have a feerate. We need the feerate for the transaction itself, the discard fee rate, and long term feerate. Fetching these each time we need them can lead to a race condition where two feerates that should be the same are actually different. One particular instance where this can happen is during the loop in `CreateTransactionInternal`. After inputs are chosen, the expected transaction fee is calculated using a newly fetched feerate. If `pick_new_inputs == false`, the loop will go again with the assumption that the fee for the transaction remains the same. However because the feerate is fetched again, it is possible that it actually isn't and this causes coin selection to fail.\r\n\r\nInstead of fetching the feerate each time it is needed, we fetch them all at once at the top of `CreateTransactionInternal`, store them in `CoinSelectionParams`, and use them where needed.\r\n\r\nWhile some of these fee rates probably don't need this caching, I've done it for consistency and the guarantee that they remain the same.\r\n\r\nFixes #19229",

          "body": "This commit just moves function without making any changes. It can be reviewed with `git log -p -n1 --color-moved=dimmed_zebra`\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change is to make `wallet.cpp/h` less monolithic and start to make wallet transaction state tracking comprehensible so bugs in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Wallet-Transaction-Conflict-Tracking can be fixed safely without introducing new problems.\r\n\r\nThis moves wallet classes and methods that deal with transactions out of `wallet.cpp/.h` into better organized files:\r\n\r\n- `transaction.cpp/.h` - CWalletTx and CMerkleTx class definitions\r\n- `receive.cpp/.h` - functions checking received transactions and computing balances\r\n- `spend.cpp/.h` - functions creating transactions and finding spendable coins\r\n\r\nAfter #20773, when loading is separated from syncing it will also be possible to move more `wallet.cpp/.h` functions to:\r\n\r\n- `sync.cpp/.h` - functions handling chain notifications and rescanning\r\n\r\nThis commit arranges `receive.cpp` and `spend.cpp` functions in dependency order so it's possible to skim `receive.cpp` and get an idea of how computing balances works, and skim `spend.cpp` and get an idea of how transactions are created, without having to jump all over `wallet.cpp` where functions are not in order and there is a lot of unrelated code.\r\n\r\nFollowup commit \"refactor: Detach wallet transaction methods\" in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21206 follows up this PR and tweaks function names and arguments to reflect new locations. The two commits are split into separate PRs because this commit is more work to maintain and less work to review, while the other commit is less work to maintain and more work to review, so hopefully this commit can be merged earlier.",

And it's possible update individual `m_confirm` and `fInMempool` data fields without setting an overall consistent state that can be serialized and handled correctly.\r\n\r\nFix this without changing behavior by using `std::variant`, instead of an enum and collection of fields, to represent sync state, so state tracking code is safer and more legible.\r\n\r\nThis is a first step to fixing state tracking bugs https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Wallet-Transaction-Conflict-Tracking, by adding an extra margin of safety that can prevent new bugs from being introduced as existing bugs are fixed.",

          "body": "Branch and Bound introduced a metric that we call waste. This metric is used as part of bounding the search tree, but it can be generalized to all coin selection solutions, including those with change. As such, this PR introduces the waste metric at a higher level so that we can run both of our coin selection algorithms (BnB and KnapsackSolver) and choose the one which has the least waste. In the event that both find a solution with the same change, we choose the one that spends more inputs.\r\n\r\nAlso this PR sets the long term feerate to 10 sat/vb rather than using the 1008 block estimate. This allows the long term feerate to be the feerate that we switch between consolidating and optimizing for fees. This also removes a bug where the long term feerate would incorrectly be set to the fallback fee. While this doesn't matter prior to this PR, it does have an effect following this. The long term feerate can be configured by the user through a new `-consolidatefeerate` option.",

This is just making methods into functions and removing circular dependencies created by #21207. There are no comment or documentation changes, either. Removed comments from `transaction.h` are just migrated to `spend.h`, `receive.h`, and `wallet.h`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis commit was split off from #21206 so there are a few earlier review comments there",

Most of them would be terrible due to huge excess and hence waste, so another solution would be chosen. But in some cases excess higher than upper bound would be\r\neconomically optimal based on waste metric.\r\n\r\nThis change also makes transaction building and waste calculation consistent. Specifically it eliminates two sources of discrepancy: \r\n\r\n1. for knapsack we used to always calculate waste as if they produce change (that's not always true)\r\n2. change could be dropped to fees during tx building after waste is calculated \r\n\r\nAs a result we should see more changeless solutions which is good for: privacy, utxo set, total fees paid.

For example if GUI code is accessing node and wallet internals or if wallet and node code are referencing each other.\r\n- To make source code organization clearer ([#15732](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15732)), being able to know that `wallet::` code is in `src/wallet/`, `node::` code is in `src/node/`, `init::` code is in `src/init/`, `util::` code is in `src/util/`, etc.\r\n\r\nReviewing with `git log -p -n1 -U0 --word-diff-regex=.` can be helpful to verify this is only updating declarations, not changing code.",

          "body": "Tracepoints can be useful for coin selection as they would allow us to observe what is being selected, selection parameters, and calculation results. So this PR adds 4 new tracepoints:\r\n\r\n1. After `SelectCoins` returns in order to observe the `SelectionResult`\r\n2. After the first `CreateTransactionInternal` to observe the created transaction\r\n3. Prior to the second `CreateTransactionInternal` to notify that the optimistic avoid partial spends selection is occurring\r\n4. After the second `CreateTransactionInternal` to observe the created transaction and inform which solution is being used.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds an algorithm enum to `SelectionResult` so that the first tracepoint will be able to report which algorithm was used to produce that result.\r\n\r\nThe primary use case for these tracepoints is in running coin selection simulations. The script I use to run these simulations use these tracepoints in order to gather data on the algorithm used and the calculated waste.",

          "title": "[Draft / POC] Silent Payments",
          "body": "This PR proposes an early version of [Silent Payment](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8) (author:@RubenSomsen).\r\nIn this scheme, the recipient generates a public address, but the sender tweaks the address and the recipient detects the payment by verifying all transactions on the blockchain. An example use case would be private donations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is not a final version, but to start the discussion and get benchmarks based on a real implementation.\r\n\r\nThis version is built on top of [#994](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/994) (bitcoin-core/secp256k1) for x-only ECDH support and #23480 (bitcoin/bitcoin) for `rawtr()`. Each new silent transaction detected is stored in wallet as a `rawtr()` descriptor. \r\n\r\nIn this implementation, the sender can tweak the recipient address by passing the `silent_payment` option to send RPC. The transaction output will be different from the address entered.\r\n\r\nFor example `./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named send outputs=\"[{\\\"bcrt1pwlh5xuyrpgfunwyww8cfu78yfs2yqyevl7yturavahh5kgxwdd2q5hzgfu\\\": 1.1}]\" fee_rate=1 options=\"{ \\\"silent_payment\\\": true}\"`.\r\n\r\nwill generate `vout` with completely unrelated outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"vout\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 1.10000000,\r\n      \"n\": 0,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(65b19890c5ca40edb816d26f5f48cd9f3ed51121613b1c2405adc1a6dbbc824a)#8myx9tcu\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pvkce3yx9efqwmwqk6fh47jxdnuld2yfpvya3cfq94hq6dkausf9qrfjkgz\",\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 2.02499835,\r\n      \"n\": 1,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(c45cb3d500bbf8f0c8841e8e011b008781d826c16ee348edb822c0f97419bc4d)#26hcce63\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pc3wt84gqh0u0pjyyr68qzxcqs7qasfkpdm353mdcytq0jaqeh3xsuvlykg\",\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny wallet, as long as it has access to private keys, can send silent payments. Thus, this excludes watch-only wallets or wallets with external signers .\r\n\r\nBut the recipient's wallet needs a new flag called `SILENT_PAYMENT`. This flag allows an additional scan that verifies that the wallet keys match the silent payment scheme. When it detects a silent payment that belongs to the wallet, it is stored in a `rawtr()` descriptor.\r\n\r\n`./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named createwallet wallet_name=\"recipient\" silent_payment=true`\r\n\r\nTherefore, scanning each address for each transaction is potentially prohibitive overhead, so the node can be initialized with `keypool=1` or a descriptor with range [0,1] can be imported into a blank wallet. Until there is more benchmark data, it is the safest option. The proposal recommends one static address.\r\n\r\nI've been running some silent payments on signet using wallets with default keypool and default range, I haven't noticed any relevant performance drops on the signet node.\r\nApparently this implementation is working as expected but I can't guarantee that the scheme is implemented correctly or safely, so I'm opening this PR for reviews, modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nThere is a new functional test (`test/functional/wallet_silentpayment.py`) that can help to better understand the implementation.",

          "title": "wallet: remove extra wtx lookup in 'AvailableCoins' + several code cleanups.",
          "body": "This started in #24845 but grew out of scope of it. \r\n\r\nSo, points tackled:\r\n\r\n1) Avoid extra `GetWalletTx` lookups inside `AvailableCoins -> IsSpentKey`.\r\n    `IsSpentKey` was receiving the tx hash and index to internally lookup the tx inside the wallet's map. As all the `IsSpentKey` function callers already have the wtx available, them can provide the `scriptPubKey` directly.\r\n\r\n2) Most of the time, we call `Wallet::AvailableCoins`, and later on the process, skip the non-spendable coins from the result in subsequent for-loops. So to speedup the process: introduced the ability to filter by \"only_spendable\" coins inside `Wallet::AvailableCoins` directly.\r\n(the non-spendable coins skip examples are inside `AttemptSelection->GroupOutputs` and `GetAvailableBalance`).\r\n\r\n4) Refactored `AvailableCoins` in several ways:\r\n\r\n   a) Now it will return a new struct `CoinsResult` instead of receiving the vCoins vector reference (which was being cleared at the beginning of the method anyway). --> this is coming from #24845 but cherry-picked it here too to make the following commits look nicer.\r\n\r\n   b) Unified all the 'wtx.tx->vout[I]' calls into a single call (coming from this comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24699#discussion_r854163032). \r\n\r\n5) The wallet `IsLockedCoin` and `IsSpent` methods now accept an `OutPoint` instead of a hash:index. Which let me cleanup a bunch of extra code.\r\n\r\n6) Speeded up the wallet 'GetAvailableBalance': filtering `AvailableCoins` by spendable outputs only and using the 'AvailableCoins' retrieved `total_amount` instead of looping over all the retrieved coins once more.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSide topic, all this process will look even nicer with #25218",

So, if the tx creation fails, it's not available inside `WalletModel::prepareTransaction` to be able to throw the `AmountWithFeeExceedsBalance` .\r\n\r\nThis PR re-implements the feature properly, inside `createTransaction` and add test coverage for it.",

There is no longer need to add the error string and the result object declarations before calling the function:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```cpp\r\nObj result_obj;\r\nstd::string error_string;\r\nif (!doSomething(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, result_obj, error_string)) {\r\n    LogPrintf(\"Error: %s\", error_string);\r\n}\r\nreturn result_obj;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n```cpp\r\nBResult<Obj> op_res = doSomething(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4);\r\nif (!op_res) {\r\n    LogPrintf(\"Error: %s\", op_res.GetError());\r\n}\r\nreturn op_res.GetObjResult();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Initial Implementation:\r\n\r\nHave connected this new concept to two different flows for now:\r\n\r\n1) The `CreateTransaction` flow. --> 7ba2b87c\r\n2) The `GetNewDestination` flow. --> bcee0912\r\n\r\nHappy note: even when introduced a new class into the sources, the amount of lines removed is almost equal to added ones :).\r\n\r\nExtra note: this work is an extended version (and a decoupling) of the work that is inside #24845 (which does not contain the `GetNewDestination` changes nor the inclusion of the `FeeCalculation` field inside `CreatedTransactionResult`).",

          "body": "This PR cleans up the interfaces of the `FundTransaction` functions by returning the out-parameters (fee, change output, error) as `util::Result` with a newly created structure `FundedTransactionResult`. It can be seen as a late follow-up to #20640 which did a similar operation to the `CreateTransaction{Internal}` functions. Note that there are actually two functions `FundTransaction` with the same name:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0b02ce914e8594e8938e527c91c07f57def4e943/src/wallet/spend.h#L160\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0b02ce914e8594e8938e527c91c07f57def4e943/src/wallet/rpc/spend.cpp#L489\r\n\r\nOnly the first returns an error and hence needs to be wrapped into `util::Result`, the other one can directly return the result structure.",

Use a const instead of inline comment in order to convey the meaning. e.g. `const int RANDOM_CHANGE_POSITION = -1`). This value is used more than once, so another reason to use a const.\r\n2. Convey that passing `-1` means \"actively set the position to a random one\" rather than \"no requested location\" which doesn't really let the reader know what's going to happen.",

I probably was a bit over-enthusiastic in getting rid of as many variables as possible before the call to `CreateTransaction` ;-) Introducing a `RANDOM_CHANGE_POSITION` constant makes a lot of sense to me, see latest force-push of the second commit. Not sure yet if putting the constant into the header is a good idea, as it is only used for one single method and hence many modules that don't need the constant would see it as well. Probably a candidate for a follow-up PR?",
