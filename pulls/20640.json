    "body": "The method `CWallet::CreateTransaction` currently returns several values in the form of out-parameters:\r\n* the actual newly created transaction (`CTransactionRef& tx`)\r\n* its required fee (`CAmount& nFeeRate`)\r\n* the position of the change output (`int& nChangePosInOut`) -- as the name suggests, this is both an in- and out-param\r\n\r\nBy returning these values in an optional structure (which returns no value a.k.a. `std::nullopt` if an error occured), the interfaces is shorter, cleaner (requested change position is now in-param and can be passed by value) and callers don't have to create dummy variables for results that they are not interested in. \r\n\r\nNote that the names of the replaced out-variables were kept in `CreateTransactionInternal` to keep the diff minimal. Also, the fee calculation data (`FeeCalculation& fee_calc_out`) would be another candidate to put into the structure, but `FeeCalculation` is currently an opaque data type in the wallet interface and I think it should stay that way.\r\n\r\nAs a potential follow-up, I think it would make sense to also do the same refactoring for `CWallet::FundTransaction`, which has a very similar parameter structure.\r\n\r\nSuggested by laanwj in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20588#issuecomment-739838428.",

This is a bit nit-picky, so bare with me please, but I think it's more appropriate to:\r\n1. Use a const instead of inline comment in order to convey the meaning. e.g. `const int RANDOM_CHANGE_POSITION = -1`). This value is used more than once, so another reason to use a const.\r\n2. Convey that passing `-1` means \"actively set the position to a random one\" rather than \"no requested location\" which doesn't really let the reader know what's going to happen.",

I probably was a bit over-enthusiastic in getting rid of as many variables as possible before the call to `CreateTransaction` ;-) Introducing a `RANDOM_CHANGE_POSITION` constant makes a lot of sense to me, see latest force-push of the second commit. Not sure yet if putting the constant into the header is a good idea, as it is only used for one single method and hence many modules that don't need the constant would see it as well. Probably a candidate for a follow-up PR?",
