Not convinced that's very beneficial though.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's much other benefit to splitting potential problems up from actual problems otherwise if the admin still needs to attend to them either way, though; so if we're already making LogError just mean actual errors; is there any reason not to merge them both into a single LogAlert() or similar?",

If something in this PR makes the documentation worse, it'd be helpful to know where the problems are. Otherwise this seems like a clean fix for the issue described in #30348, and a way to close that issue and move on to other fixes and improvements.\r\n\r\nI do understand what you are saying about the `error()` removal in #29236 making the issue described in #30348 worse because it increased the amount of Error spam. But it's not like this PR is changing documentation to say that Error spam is ok. It is clearly not. It is just trying to remove a separate point of confusion.",

If there's places in our code that don't meet that expectation, then that's something that should be fixed, though it doesn't need to be treated as some huge priority. On the other hand, if there's no distinction between the levels that's worth making, we shouldn't have two levels. So I think either the status quo or #30364 is better than this PR. It's not really worth arguing about, but it's frustrating having people put words in my mouth that aren't mine.",
