    "body": "~This PR is based on #22383, which should be reviewed first~ (merged by now).\r\n\r\nIn [yesterday's PR review club session to PR 22383](https://bitcoincore.reviews/22383), the idea of moving the function `GetTransaction(...)` from src/validation.cpp to src/node/transaction.cpp came up. With this, the circular dependency \"index/txindex -> validation -> index/txindex\" is removed (see change in `lint-circular-dependencies.sh`). Thanks to jnewbery for suggesting and to sipa for providing historical background.\r\n\r\nRelevant IRC log:\r\n```\r\n17:52 <jnewbery> Was anyone surprised that GetTransaction() is in validation.cpp? It seems to me that node/transaction.cpp would be a more appropriate place for it.\r\n17:53 <raj_> jnewbery, +1\r\n17:53 <stickies-v> agreed!\r\n17:54 <glozow> jnewbery ya\r\n17:54 <jnewbery> seems weird that validation would call into txindex. I wonder if we remove this function, then validation would no longer need to #include txindex\r\n17:54 <sipa> GetTransaction predates node/transaction.cpp, and even the generic index framework itself :)\r\n17:55 <sipa> (before 0.8, validation itself used the txindex)\r\n17:55 <jnewbery> (and GetTransaction() seems like a natural sibling to BroadcastTransaction(), which is already in node/transaction.cpp)\r\n17:55 <jnewbery> sipa: right, this is not meant as a criticism of course. Just wondering if we can organize things a bit more rationally now that we have better separation between things.\r\n17:55 <sipa> jnewbery: sure, just providing background\r\n17:56 <sipa> seems very reasonable to move it elsewhere now\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe commit should be trivial to review with `--color-moved`.",

          "body": "# Motivation\r\nThe main motivation of this change and only behavior change noticeable by user is to allow running `coinstatsindex` on pruned nodes as has been requested [here for example](https://twitter.com/benthecarman/status/1388170854140452870?s=20).\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n`coinstatsindex` on pruned nodes can be enabled in a much simpler than it is done here but it comes with downside. The ability to run `blockfilterindex`on pruned nodes was added in #15946 but it also added the `blockfilterindex` as a dependency to `validation` and it introduced two new circular dependencies. Enabling `coinstatsindex` on pruned nodes in a similar way would add it as a dependency as well and introduce another circular dependency. \r\n\r\nInstead, this PR introduces a `m_prune_blockers` map to `BlockManager` as a flexible approach to block pruning. Entities like `blockfilterindex`, for example, can add a key and a height to block pruning over that height. These entities need to update that value to allow more pruning when they are ready.\r\n\r\n# Alternative approach\r\nUpon completing the first draft of this PR I found #19463 as an alternative that follows the same but follows a very different approach. I am listing the main differences here as I see them:\r\n- Usage of globals\r\n- Blocks pruning with a start and a stop height\r\n- Can persist blockers across restarts\r\n- Blockers can be set/unset via RPCs\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't think any of these are necessary to be added here but if the general approach or specific features are more appealing to reviewers I am happy to change to a solution based on that PR or port over specific parts of it here.",
