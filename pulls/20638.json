    "body": "With 0.21.0rc3, we found that the code signature for the MacOS dmg was invalid. Further investigation revealed that this was due to a difference in the behavior of `codesign_allocate` from native_cctools and `codesign_allocate` distributed by Apple with the Xcode command line tools package. The result is that the `vmsize` of the `__LINKEDIT` section of the binary differed between the two which made the signature produced invalid for our gitian built binary.\r\n\r\n`codesign_allocate` is used by the `codesign` tool to allocate space in the binary for the code signature before signing. During the gitian build where the signature is attached, the `detached-sig-apply.sh` script also uses `codesign_allocate` to allocate space in the binary before the code signature is attached. Thus we need both versions to have the same behavior. But what we observe is that the Apple distributed `codesign_allocate` will compute a `vmsize` that is rounded to 0x2000, while the `codesign_allocate` from native_cctools (that we use in gitian) rounds to 0x1000. So this `vmsize` field in the `__LINKEDIT` section differs.\r\n\r\nTo work around this problem, we use the fact that `codesign_allocate` doesn't reduce the size of `vmsize`, only increases it. We can thus pre-allocate space for the code signature before signing even happens, and when signing happens, the execution of `codesign_allocate` will not change the `vmsize`, it only effects the real size of the binary. This ensures that `vmsize` is set before signing occurs so that the only thing that we really need to do is actually just attaching the signature to the binary. This PR uses a fixed pre-allocation value of 500000 because the largest MacOS code signature since 0.12.1 that I could find was 407424 bytes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `codesign` tool has an option to change the \"page size\". It appears that the tool signs the executable split into pages. But if we do `--pagesize 0`, it will sign the binary as a single large page. This should reduce the size of the code signature and also make it more consistent. This makes it much more likely that the signature will be smaller than the pre-allocation of 500000 bytes.",

      "body": "I've mostly worked out why the code signature is so big. The signature is primarily composed of hashes of 4096 byte pages of the unsigned binary. Then there is ~8kb of signature, and another ~10kb of overhead that I'm not quite sure. But given this, we can get a more accurate estimate of the actual size of the code signature.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I've dropped the commit that does `--pagesize 0`. As we can kind of predict what the signature size will be, it isn't necessary to make the signature as small as possible. Additionally, I believe MacOS is doing something with that list of hashes, perhaps an integrity check of each page as it is loaded into memory, so changing that may not be a good idea.",

      "body": "Apparently doing `codesign_allocate` before the actual code signing causes `codesign` to fail. This is because the tool detects that there is supposed to be a signature there. It then attempts to parse the signature and verify it. However because it is just 0's, it fails to do this and errors. To work around this issue, after doing `codesign_allocate`, we can apply a bogus signature. Since we pass the `-f`/`--force` option to `codesign` already, this bogus signature will be overwritten with the correct signature during actual signing. But because a validly formatted signature is present, `codesign` does not error when it encounters the bogus signature. For the bogus signature, I am just using the rc3 signature. This bogus signature is only attached to the binary that the codesigner signs, not the unsigned binary that we upload.\r\n\r\nI was able to test the entire process using a self-signed certificate. The initial gitian build works, I was able to sign create the detached signature, the Gitian signer build works, and the resulting binary validates. I also did a sign of the unmodified unsigned binary.

      "message": "Work around codesign_allocate differences\n\nThe tool codesign_allocate compiled from native_cctools (based on\nApple's published source code) and the codesign_allocate shipped by\nApple in its Xcode command line tools behave differently when it comes\nto rounding to a page size for a field named \"vmsize\". The open source\none rounds to 0x1000 while the binary rounds to 0x2000. This can result\nin a situation where a valid signature is made, but when we attach it\no the unsigned binary during Gitian builds, a different binary comes\nout that fails the signature validation.\n\nTo work around this, we rely on the behavior that codesign_allocate does\nnot reduce \"vmsize\", only increases it. At the end of the Gitian build\nstep when we have created the unsigned binary, we use codesign_allocate\nto allocate a large amount of space at the end of the file for the code\nsignature. This will set \"vmsize\" to something fairly high.\n\nThen during signing, Apple's codesign tool will call codesign_allocate\nand reallocate space for the signature. However this only effects the\nreal size of the binary, not the \"vmsize\". So our larger \"vmsize\"\nremains, using the rounding of the native_cctools version of\ncodesign_allocate. Thus we can ensure that \"vmsize\" remains the same\nthroughout the signing process and then the subsequent attaching.",

For some reason, this also happens\n+    # to differ between what we can build ourselves in native_cctools (which uses Apple's published source code) and what Apple distributes\n+    # as \"Xcode command line tools\". It appears that the Apple distributed tool rounds to 0x2000.\n+    #\n+    # Fortunately codesign_allocate will not reduce the \"vmsize\" attribute, and when the signature is appended, the difference in actual size and\n+    # \"vmsize\" will not be present in the final binary.\n+    #\n+    # Thus we can workaround this by calculating an overestimate of what the signature will be and then using codesign_allocate to preallocate\n+    # space for the code signature. Because the same codesign_allocate is used in this step, the rounding problem will not be present.\n+    # Since the space allocated for the signature should be larger than actually needed, the signing step will not reduce \"vmsize\" so we\n+    # won't have any problems there.\n+    #\n+    # From inspecting previous releases' code signatures, we find that the code signature primarily consists of SHA256 hashes of 4096 byte chunk\n+    # of the unsigned binary. There are a few other hashes of something. Then the signature itself, which is ~9kb. Then ~10kb of additional overhead.\n+    # We can thus produce an overestimate as follows: (((unsigned_size / 4096) + 1) * 32) + 50000. This gives us an expected number of SHA256 hashes\n+    # and how large they will be. By adding 50k, we can include the signature, overhead, and still have room if Apple decides to cram more stuff\n+    # into the code signature.\n+    BINARY_RESULT=\"dist/Bitcoin-Qt.app/Contents/MacOS/Bitcoin-Qt\"\n+    UNSIGNED_SIZE=`stat -c %s ${BINARY_RESULT}`",
