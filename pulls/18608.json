    "body": "This PR is replaced by #27224 (because of a permissions issue it was closed and locked and couldn't be reopened)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #21353.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`7a05b1dee2f` refactor: Remove CAddressBookData::destdata](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18608/commits/7a05b1dee2fa68b32bfb19e273fb55a5b3836a3e)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is cleanup that doesn't change external behavior.\r\n\r\n- Removes awkward `StringMap` intermediate representation\r\n- Deals with receive request \"rr\" keys in walletdb.cpp instead of all over qt, wallet, and interfaces code\r\n- Deals with destination \"used\" keys in walletdb.cpp instead of all over wallet code\r\n- Adds test coverage\r\n- Reduces code (+85/-138 lines)\r\n- Reduces memory usage\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change externally observable behavior. Internally, only change in behavior is that EraseDestData deletes directly from database because the `StringMap` is gone. This is more direct and efficient because it uses a single btree lookup and scan instead of multiple lookups\r\n\r\nMotivation for this cleanup is making changes like #18550, #18192, #13756 easier to reason about and less likely to result in unintended behavior and bugs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

      "body": "> Simply adding new metadata shouldn't require touching the db layer\r\n\r\nAdding new metadata should touch the walletdb layer because it changes the database format. The reason why #13756 introduced a bug is no one understood how it was changing the database format. I try to look at format changes very closely and I didn't pay any attention at all to that PR because it wasn't modifying walletdb. (Implementation of #13756 would also have been smaller and simpler if it was adding a new walletdb key, in addition to avoiding the bug.)\r\n\r\n> the db layer shouldn't have visibility into stuff like `CTxDestination`\r\n\r\nWhere's this coming from? I could pretty easily move the EncodeDestination/DecodeDestination calls out of walletdb, but it's already accepting and returning CKeyMetadata, CPubKey, CKeyMetadata, CMasterKey, CWalletTx values so CTxDestination hardly seems like a bridge too far.\r\n\r\n> Concept NACK. This completely breaks down the layering/abstraction here... \r\n\r\nLet me know specifically what's broken. This PR gets rid of complexity and code and should make it safer and easier to make changes extending the database format in the future.",

      "body": "> > Adding new metadata should touch the walletdb layer because it changes the database format.\r\n\r\n> Not usually, no.\r\n\r\nThis discussion is too handwavy and general to be productive, but if you believe the PR creates problems here, you should be able to provide examples of database format changes that _should_ bypass walletdb and that this PR will make more difficult.\r\n\r\n> And do we really want db-level wrapper functions for every single piece of metadata?? That's exactly the kind of thing destdata was supposed to help avoid...\r\n\r\nThere are various extension points in the wallet for metadata, and this PR doesn't remove them. This PR removes the `CAddressBookData::destdata` extension point because it was badly implemented and misused, already caused a bug, and is a loaded gun waiting to cause more bugs. Your PR #18550 removes the loaded gun by complicating the destdata implementation. But I objected to #18550 because of other changes it bundles, and the complexity it adds turns out not to be necessary here because we can just get rid of the destdata field while simplifying code and not changing behavior.\r\n\r\n> > The reason why #13756 introduced a bug is no one understood how it was changing the database format. I try to look at format changes very closely and I didn't pay any attention at all to that PR because it wasn't modifying walletdb. (Implementation of #13756 would also have been smaller and simpler if it was adding a new walletdb key, in addition to avoiding the bug.)\r\n\r\n> The bug was completely unrelated to the database format. Even if the wallet was left in RAM, and never written to a database (not possible with our code, just hypothetical), the bug would have remained...\r\n\r\nI'd like to interpret this charitably since it is vague and talking about a hypothetical alternate implementation of #13756, but I think this is basically nonsense. If `CAddressBookData::destdata` field didn't exist, #13756 wouldn't have store used data in `CAddressBookData`. It would have added something like `(\"useddata\" << EncodeDestionation(dest))` rows and a `std::set<CTxDestination> m_used_dests` `CWallet` member, avoiding the bug and requiring less code to implement.\r\n\r\n> And simply using a new database key would not have fixed it either...\r\n\r\nNot only would using a non-DESTDATA database key have been _sufficient_ to fix it in the most likely scenario (described above) for the 0.19 release, but using a non-DESTDATA key would have been _necessary_ to fix it for all pre-0.19 releases, because they treat addresses with DESTDATA rows as non-change.\r\n\r\nReally, Luke, DESTDATA is garbage. This PR isolates it to the lowest layer of walletdb, reducing complexity in upper layers and preventing them from misusing it again.\r\n\r\nIf you want to add new metadata fields, even new extensible metadata fields, nothing in the PR prevents it or makes it more difficult. I know you're claiming otherwise, but it's not true and you haven't provided plausible examples or specifics to back up your assertions. I promise this PR isn't trying to rain on your metadata parade.",

Internally, only change in behavior is that EraseDestData deletes directly from database because the `StringMap` is gone. This is more direct and efficient because it uses a single btree lookup and scan instead of multiple lookups\n\nMotivation for this cleanup is making changes like #18550, #18192, #13756 easier to reason about and less likely to result in unintended behavior and bugs",
