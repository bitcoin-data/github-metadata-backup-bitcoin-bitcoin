    "body": "This PR is replaced by #27224 (because of a permissions issue it was closed and locked and couldn't be reopened)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #21353.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`7a05b1dee2f` refactor: Remove CAddressBookData::destdata](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18608/commits/7a05b1dee2fa68b32bfb19e273fb55a5b3836a3e)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is cleanup that doesn't change external behavior.\r\n\r\n- Removes awkward `StringMap` intermediate representation\r\n- Deals with receive request \"rr\" keys in walletdb.cpp instead of all over qt, wallet, and interfaces code\r\n- Deals with destination \"used\" keys in walletdb.cpp instead of all over wallet code\r\n- Adds test coverage\r\n- Reduces code (+85/-138 lines)\r\n- Reduces memory usage\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change externally observable behavior. Internally, only change in behavior is that EraseDestData deletes directly from database because the `StringMap` is gone. This is more direct and efficient because it uses a single btree lookup and scan instead of multiple lookups\r\n\r\nMotivation for this cleanup is making changes like #18550, #18192, #13756 easier to reason about and less likely to result in unintended behavior and bugs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

The reason why #13756 introduced a bug is no one understood how it was changing the database format. I try to look at format changes very closely and I didn't pay any attention at all to that PR because it wasn't modifying walletdb. (Implementation of #13756 would also have been smaller and simpler if it was adding a new walletdb key, in addition to avoiding the bug.)\r\n\r\n> the db layer shouldn't have visibility into stuff like `CTxDestination`\r\n\r\nWhere's this coming from? I could pretty easily move the EncodeDestination/DecodeDestination calls out of walletdb, but it's already accepting and returning CKeyMetadata, CPubKey, CKeyMetadata, CMasterKey, CWalletTx values so CTxDestination hardly seems like a bridge too far.\r\n\r\n> Concept NACK. This completely breaks down the layering/abstraction here... \r\n\r\nLet me know specifically what's broken. This PR gets rid of complexity and code and should make it safer and easier to make changes extending the database format in the future.",

          "body": "Introducing the wallet of the glorious future (again): native descriptor wallets. With native descriptor wallets, addresses are generated from descriptors. Instead of generating keys and deriving addresses from keys, addresses come from the scriptPubKeys produced by a descriptor. Native descriptor wallets will be optional for now and can only be created by using `createwallet`.\r\n\r\nDescriptor wallets will store descriptors, master keys from the descriptor, and descriptor cache entries. Keys are derived from descriptors on the fly. In order to allow choosing different address types, 6 descriptors are needed for normal use. There is a pair of primary and change descriptors for each of the 3 address types. With the default keypool size of 1000, each descriptor has 1000 scriptPubKeys and descriptor cache entries pregenerated. This has a side effect of making wallets large since 6000 pubkeys are written to the wallet by default, instead of the current 2000. scriptPubKeys are kept only in memory and are generated every time a descriptor is loaded. By default, we use the standard BIP 44, 49, 84 derivation paths with an external and internal derivation chain for each.\r\n\r\nDescriptors can also be imported with a new `importdescriptors` RPC.\r\n\r\nNative descriptor wallets use the `ScriptPubKeyMan` interface introduced in #16341 to add a `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan`. This defines a different IsMine which uses the simpler model of \"does this scriptPubKey exist in this wallet\". Furthermore, `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan` does not have watchonly, so with native descriptor wallets, it is not possible to have a wallet with both watchonly and non-watchonly things. Rather a wallet with `disable_private_keys` needs to be used for watchonly things.\r\n\r\nA `--descriptor` option was added to some tests (`wallet_basic.py`, `wallet_encryption.py`, `wallet_keypool.py`, `wallet_keypool_topup.py`, and `wallet_labels.py`) to allow for these tests to use descriptor wallets. Additionally, several RPCs are disabled for descriptor wallets (`importprivkey`, `importpubkey`, `importaddress`, `importmulti`, `addmultisigaddress`, `dumpprivkey`, `dumpwallet`, `importwallet`, and `sethdseed`).",

      "body": "> > Adding new metadata should touch the walletdb layer because it changes the database format.\r\n\r\n> Not usually, no.\r\n\r\nThis discussion is too handwavy and general to be productive, but if you believe the PR creates problems here, you should be able to provide examples of database format changes that _should_ bypass walletdb and that this PR will make more difficult.\r\n\r\n> And do we really want db-level wrapper functions for every single piece of metadata?? That's exactly the kind of thing destdata was supposed to help avoid...\r\n\r\nThere are various extension points in the wallet for metadata, and this PR doesn't remove them. This PR removes the `CAddressBookData::destdata` extension point because it was badly implemented and misused, already caused a bug, and is a loaded gun waiting to cause more bugs. Your PR #18550 removes the loaded gun by complicating the destdata implementation. But I objected to #18550 because of other changes it bundles, and the complexity it adds turns out not to be necessary here because we can just get rid of the destdata field while simplifying code and not changing behavior.\r\n\r\n> > The reason why #13756 introduced a bug is no one understood how it was changing the database format. I try to look at format changes very closely and I didn't pay any attention at all to that PR because it wasn't modifying walletdb. (Implementation of #13756 would also have been smaller and simpler if it was adding a new walletdb key, in addition to avoiding the bug.)\r\n\r\n> The bug was completely unrelated to the database format. Even if the wallet was left in RAM, and never written to a database (not possible with our code, just hypothetical), the bug would have remained...\r\n\r\nI'd like to interpret this charitably since it is vague and talking about a hypothetical alternate implementation of #13756, but I think this is basically nonsense. If `CAddressBookData::destdata` field didn't exist, #13756 wouldn't have store used data in `CAddressBookData`. It would have added something like `(\"useddata\" << EncodeDestionation(dest))` rows and a `std::set<CTxDestination> m_used_dests` `CWallet` member, avoiding the bug and requiring less code to implement.\r\n\r\n> And simply using a new database key would not have fixed it either...\r\n\r\nNot only would using a non-DESTDATA database key have been _sufficient_ to fix it in the most likely scenario (described above) for the 0.19 release, but using a non-DESTDATA key would have been _necessary_ to fix it for all pre-0.19 releases, because they treat addresses with DESTDATA rows as non-change.\r\n\r\nReally, Luke, DESTDATA is garbage. This PR isolates it to the lowest layer of walletdb, reducing complexity in upper layers and preventing them from misusing it again.\r\n\r\nIf you want to add new metadata fields, even new extensible metadata fields, nothing in the PR prevents it or makes it more difficult. I know you're claiming otherwise, but it's not true and you haven't provided plausible examples or specifics to back up your assertions. I promise this PR isn't trying to rain on your metadata parade.",

Additionally, instead of changing the `Send` button to `Create Unsigned` when there are no private keys, just always have a `Create Unsigned` button and disable `Send` when there are no private keys.

          "body": "Big picture overview in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Sjors/29d06728c685e6182828c1ce9b74483d).\r\n\r\nThis PR lets `bitcoind` call an arbitrary command `-signer=<cmd>`, e.g. a hardware wallet driver,  where it can fetch public keys, ask to display an address, and sign a transaction (using PSBT under the hood).\r\n\r\nIt's design to work with https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI, which supports multiple hardware wallets. Any command with the same arguments and return values will work. It simplifies the manual procedure described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/blob/master/docs/bitcoin-core-usage.md).\r\n\r\nUsage is documented in [doc/external-signer.md](\r\nhttps://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2019/08/hww-box2/doc/external-signer.md), which also describes what protocol a different signer binary should conform to.\r\n\r\nUse `--enable-external-signer` to opt in, requires Boost::Process:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptions used to compile and link:\r\n  with wallet     = yes\r\n  with gui / qt   = no\r\n  external signer = yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt adds the following RPC methods:\r\n* `enumeratesigners`: asks <cmd> for a list of signers (e.g. devices) and their master key fingerprint\r\n* `signerdisplayaddress <address>`:  asks <cmd> to display an address\r\n\r\nIt enhances the following RPC methods:\r\n* `createwallet`: takes an additional `external_signer` argument and fetches keys from device\r\n* `send`: automatically sends transaction to device and waits \r\n\r\nUsage TL&DR:\r\n* clone HWI repo somewhere and launch `bitcoind -signer=../HWI/hwi.py`\r\n* check if you can see your hardware device: `bitcoin-cli enumeratesigners`\r\n* create wallet and auto import keys `bitcoin-cli createwallet \"hww\" true true \"\" true true true`\r\n* display address on device: `bitcoin-cli signerdisplayaddress ...`\r\n* to spend, use `send` RPC and approve transaction on device\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n- [x] #21127 load wallet flags before everything else\r\n- [x] #21182 remove mostly pointless BOOST_PROCESS macro\r\n\r\nPotentially useful followups:\r\n- GUI support: bitcoin-core/gui#4\r\n- bumpfee support\r\n- (automatically) verify (a subset of) keys on the device after import, through message signing",

It consists of 7 commits on top of #16546 (RPC).\r\n\r\nThe UX isn't amazing - especially the blocking calls - but it works.\r\n\r\nFirst we adds a GUI setting for the signer script (e.g. path to HWI):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"625\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-08-05 om 19 32 59\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/62483415-e1ff1680-b7b7-11e9-97ca-8d2ce54ca1cb.png\">\r\n\r\nThen we add an external signer checkbox to the wallet creation dialog:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"374\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-11-07 om 19 17 23\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/68416387-b57ee000-0194-11ea-9730-127d60273008.png\">\r\n\r\nIt's checked by default if HWI detects a device. It also grabs the name. It then creates a fresh wallet and imports the keys.\r\n\r\nYou can verify an address on the device (blocking...):\r\n<img width=\"673\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-08-05 om 19 29 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/62483560-43bf8080-b7b8-11e9-9902-8a036116dc4b.png\">\r\n\r\nSending, including coin selection, Just Works(tm) as long the device is present. It's a bit weird though: the device will prompt for signing first and the QT confirmation dialog appears after.\r\n\r\nExternal signer support is enabled by default when the GUI is configured and Boost::Process is present.",

Then after a few releases make it the default. That way users can still downgrade their node without losing access to the wallet.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to `./configure` without BDB, but we'll probably have to ship with BDB 4.8 (at least the ability to read) until the heat death of the universe.",

          "title": "wallet: Refactor the classes in wallet/db.{cpp/h}",
          "body": "The data storage layer of the wallet is fairly complicated and not well encapsulated or modularized. This makes it difficult for us to introduce new data storage methods. So this PR refactors it such that there is a clear way to introduce other storage options. This is also intended to clean up the logic of the database layer so that it is easier to follow and reason about.\r\n\r\nIn the database, there are 3 classes: `BerkeleyBatch`, `BerkeleyDatabase`, and `BerkeleyEnvironment`. `BerkeleyDatabase` is typenamed to `WalletDatabase`. The goal is to introduce two abstract classes: `WalletDatabase` and `DatabaseBatch`. These will be implemented by `BerkeleyDatabase` and `BerkeleyBatch`. This abstract classes can be inherited by other storage methods. All of the database specific things should be hidden in those classes.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we move the database handling things in `BerkeleyBatch` and turn it purely into a data accessor for the `BerkeleyDatabase`. Particularly, various static functions that operated on a `BerkeleyDatabase` are changed to be member functions of `BerkeleyDatabase`. `Read`, `Write`, `Erase`, and `Exists` are refactored to have separate functions that can be overridden by other classes. Instead of `GetCursor` returning a BDB specific `Dbc` object, new `CreateCursor` and `CloseCursor` functions are added and the cursor is handled internally within the `BerkeleyBatch`. We are then able to introduce the `DatabaseBatch` abstract class.\r\n\r\nFunctionality is further moved out of `BerkeleyBatch` into `BerkeleyDatabase`. Notably the `Db` handle creation is moved from `BerkeleyBatch`'s constructor and to a new `Open` function in `BerkeleyDatabase`. `BerkeleyDatabase` will also handle closing with a new `Close` function instead of having this be part of `Flush`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the existence of `BerkeleyEnvironment` is hidden inside of `BerkeleyDatabase`. `mapFileUseCount` is removed. Instead `WalletDatabase` will track it's use count with `m_refcount`. This is incremented by newly introduced `AddRef` and `RemoveRef` functions. `m_refcount` is used to ensure that the database and environment are not closed while the database may still be in use.\r\n\r\nInstead of each `BerkeleyEnvironment` tracking the fileids of the databases in that environment, a global map `g_fileids` is used. Since we were already going through every open fileid for the uniqeness check, it doesn't matter what `BerkeleyEnvironment` has a database with a particular fileid. All we care about is that there is a database in any of the environments that has the same fileid of the database that is currently being opened.\r\n\r\nLastly, `BerkeleyBatch, `BerkeleyDatabase`, and `BerkeleyEnvironment` are moved into new files `wallet/bdb.{cpp/h}`. `WalletDatabase` and `DatabaseBatch` are in `wallet/db.{cpp/h}`. This just gives better organization of the code so they aren't all mixed together.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI've started breaking this down into separate PRs. Some of the simpler stuff is moved up to the front so they can be merged first.\r\n\r\n* [x] Mostly simple moveonly things: #19290\r\n  * walletdb: Make SpliWalletFilePath non-static\r\n  * walletdb: Add IsBDBWalletLoaded to look for BDB wallets specifically\r\n  * walletdb: move IsWalletLoaded to walletdb.cpp\r\n  * walletdb: moveonly: Move BerkeleyBatch Cursor and Txn funcs to cpp\r\n  * walletdb: Move BDB specific things into bdb.{cpp/h}\r\n\r\nThese PRs are independent of each other and can be merged out of order after #19290 is merged\r\n* [x] Refactor Read, Write, Erase, Exists: #19292\r\n  * walletdb: refactor Read, Write, Erase, and Exists into non-template func\r\n* [x] Handle cursor internally: #19308\r\n  * walletdb: Handle cursor internally\r\n* [x] Make Create, CreateMock, and CreateDummy standalone: #19310\r\n  * Add Create*WalletDatabase functions\r\n  * scripted-diff: Replace WalletDatabase::Create* with CreateWalletDatabase\r\n  * Remove WalletDatabase::Create, CreateMock, and CreateDummy\r\n* [x] Move BerkeleyBatch static functions: #19324\r\n  * walletdb: Combine VerifyDatabaseFile and VerifyEnvironment\r\n  * walletdb: Move PeriodicFlush into WalletDatabase\r\n  * walletdb: Move Rewrite into BerkeleyDatabase\r\n\r\nThese PRs require the previous listed to be merged first and need to be merged in order\r\n* [x] Introduce `DatabaseBatch`: #19325\r\n  * walletdb: Refactor DatabaseBatch abstract class from BerkeleyBatch\r\n  * walletdb: Add MakeBatch function to BerkeleyDatabase and use it\r\n* [x] Introduce `WalletDatabase`: #19334\r\n  * walletdb: Move BerkeleyDatabase::Flush(true) to Close()\r\n  * walletdb: Introduce AddRef and RemoveRef functions\r\n  * walletdb: Add BerkeleyDatabase::Open dummy function\r\n  * walletdb: Introduce WalletDatabase abstract class\r\n* [ ] Cleanup the separation: #19335\r\n  * walletdb: track database file use as m_refcount within BerkeleyDatabase\r\n  * walletdb: Move Db->open to BerkeleyDatabase::Open\r\n  * walletdb: Use a global g_fileids instead of m_fileids for each env\r\n  * walletdb: Remove BerkeleyBatch friend class from BerkeleyDatabase\r\n\r\nI will continue to break this down as things get merged.",

          "title": "wallet: Add sqlite as an alternative wallet database and use it for new descriptor wallets",
          "body": "This PR adds a new class `SQLiteDatabase` which is a subclass of `WalletDatabase`. This provides access to a SQLite database that is used to store the wallet records. To keep compatibility with BDB and to complexity of the change down, we don't make use of many SQLite's features. We use it strictly as a key-value store. We create a table `main` which has two columns, `key` and `value` both with the type `blob`.\r\n\r\nFor new descriptor wallets, we will create a `SQLiteDatabase` instead of a `BerkeleyDatabase`. There is no requirement that all SQLite wallets are descriptor wallets, nor is there a requirement that all descriptor wallets be SQLite wallets. This allows for existing descriptor wallets to work as well as keeping open the option to migrate existing wallets to SQLite.\r\n\r\nWe keep the name `wallet.dat` for SQLite wallets. We are able to determine which database type to use by searching for specific magic bytes in the `wallet.dat` file. SQLite begins it's files with a null terminated string `SQLite format 3`. BDB has `0x00053162` at byte 12 (note that the byte order of this integer depends on the system endianness). So when we see that there is a `wallet.dat` file that we want to open, we check for the magic bytes to determine which database system to use.\r\n\r\nI decided to keep the `wallet.dat` naming to keep things like backup script to continue to function as they won't need to be modified to look for a different file name. It also simplifies a couple of things in the implementation and the tests as `wallet.dat` is something that is specifically being looked for. If we don't want this behavior, then I do have another branch which creates `wallet.sqlite` files instead, but I find that this direction is easier.",

          "title": "wallettool: Add dump and createfromdump commands",
          "body": "Adds two commands to the `bitcoin-wallet` tool: `dump` and `createfromdump`. These commands will be useful for a wallet storage migration in the future. It is also generally useful to have a storage agnostic dump like this. These commands are similar to BDB's `db_dump` and `db_load` tools. This can also be useful for manual construction of a wallet file for tests.\r\n\r\n`dump` outputs every key-value pair from the wallet as comma separated hex. Each key-value pair is on its own line with the key and value in hex separated by a comma. This is output to the file specified by the new `-dumpfile` option.\r\n\r\n`createfromdump` takes a file produced by `dump` and creates a new wallet file with exactly the records specified in that file.\r\n\r\nA new option `-dumpfile` is added to the wallet tool. When used with `dump`, the records will be written to the specified file. When used with `createfromdump`, the file is read and the key-value pairs constructed from it. `createfromdump` requires `-dumpfile`.\r\n\r\nA simple round-trip test is added to the `tool_wallet.py`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #19334,",

          "title": "Replace boost::filesystem with std::filesystem",
          "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nC++17 has introduced the filesystem library. [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem) describes very well the origin of the library:\r\n\r\n> The filesystem library was originally developed as boost.filesystem, was published as the technical specification ISO/IEC TS 18822:2015, and finally merged to ISO C++ as of C++17. The boost implementation is currently available on more compilers and platforms than the C++17 library.\r\n\r\nThis draft PR was created to gain feedback and examine what would be necessary to switch from `boost::filesystem` to `std::filesystem` in bitcoin codebase.\r\n\r\nBitcoin codebase contains `src/fs.h` which is a wrapper for the [currently used filesystem library](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6762a627ecb89ba8d4ed81a049a5d802e6dd75c2/src/fs.h#L18). The first impression is that one may just replace `namespace fs = boost::filesystem;` with `namespace fs = std::filesystem;` and all will be good. Unfortunately, there are some differences between the [Boost's filesystem library](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/filesystem/doc/reference.html) and the [c++17 filesystem library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem). A nice summary by Davis Herring can be read [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40899267/how-similar-are-boost-filesystem-and-the-c-standard-filesystem-library).\r\n\r\n## Differences between filesystem implementations that affects Bitcoin code\r\n\r\n1. `boost::filesystem::system_complete()` was renamed to `std::filesystem::absolute()` \\[[source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46271698)\\]\r\n\r\n2. [boost::filesystem::absolute()](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/filesystem/doc/reference.html#absolute) has second `const path& base` parameter which was dropped in [std::filesystem::absolute](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/absolute) (see [reasoning](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0492r2.html#US78)).\r\n\r\n     Each such instance like [this one](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/blockchain.cpp#L2284) can be fixed by changing:\r\n\r\n     `fs::path path = fs::absolute(request.params[0].get_str(), GetDataDir());`\r\n\r\n     to\r\n\r\n    `fs::path path = fs::absolute(GetDataDir() / request.params[0].get_str());` where `/` is function call of `operator/` function.\r\n\r\n     Note: Notably `path(\"foo\") / \"c:/bar\"` yields `c:/bar`. However, that's how `boost::filesystem::absolute(p, base_dir)` behaves too.\r\n\r\n3. [boost::filesystem::path::imbue()](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/filesystem/doc/reference.html#path-imbue) is not present in `std::filesystem::path`.\r\n\r\n4. [boost::filesystem::unique_path()](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/filesystem/doc/reference.html#unique_path) is not present in `std::filesystem`.\r\n\r\n5. [boost::filesystem::equivalent(path1, path2)](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/blob/812cb9bad3bcbb2161c7cd2c1132b51c4b29c4b9/src/operations.cpp#L1241) differs from [std::filesystem::equivalent(path1, path2)](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/00b161b8971bc6d3cb55f13502288b8fe0dbaa42/libcxx/src/filesystem/operations.cpp#L917) as the later reports *not supported* error if one of the files does not exist whereas Boost returns `false`.\r\n    * See also [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/equivalent).\r\n\r\n## Support for C++17 `<filesystem`>\r\n\r\n* Clang 7+ (see [[Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Filesystem-Lands-LLVM-Libcpp)][[git commit](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxx/commit/a0866c5fb5020d15c69deda94d32a7f982b88dc9)])\r\n* GCC 8.1+ ([[GCC status page](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/status.html#status.iso.2017)] [[git commit](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/commit/3b90ed62fb848046ed7ddef07df7c806e7f3fadb)])\r\n  * GCC 8.x requires linking with `-lstdc++fs`.\r\n\r\n## Issues & PRs that may be linked with this PR\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13103, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13787, https://github.com/google/leveldb/pull/760, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6093\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n* [x] Remove Boost's filesystem from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/configure.ac (help is welcome)\r\n  * Relevant PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7302 & https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/76ac35f36d87078da62f95b4a1167ec296e37363\r\n  * Done in #19667.\r\n* [ ] [Am I missing `-lstdc++fs`](https://www.bfilipek.com/2019/05/boost-to-stdfs.html)?\r\n* [ ] What about https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19933?\r\n* [ ] Address this change https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19960\r\n* [ ] `unicodepath` test in  `src/test/dbwrapper_tests.cpp` seems to require some UTF-8 locale.\r\n  * See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ae9ee5bdb18c5babbfa2875ab694df118d6a1c1b/src/util/system.cpp#L1249\r\n  * https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/2aa944beba9af1d72537fd5e35d402c8b830a5dc/stl/src/filesystem.cpp#L266 - C++17 in Microsoft C++ standard library\r\n  * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/filesystem?view=msvc-160\r\n  * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/file-system-navigation?view=msvc-160\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/ceptontech/filesystem\r\n* https://github.com/ceztko/u8filesystem",

The goal of this is to clean up them up so that they are logically separated.\r\n\r\n`BerkeleyBatch` currently handles the creation of the `BerkeleyDatabase`'s `Db` handle. This is instead moved into `BerkeleyDatabase` and is called by `BerkeleyBatch`.\r\n\r\nInstead of having `BerkeleyEnvironment` track each database's usage, have `BerkeleyDatabase` track this usage itself with the `m_refcount` variable that is present in `WalletDatabase`.\r\n\r\nLastly, instead of having each `BerkeleyEnvironment` store the fileids of the databases open in it, have a global `g_fileids` to track those fileids. We were already checking fileid uniqueness globally (by checking the fileids in every environment when opening a database) so it's cleaner to do this with a global variable.\r\n\r\nAll of these changes allow us to make `BerkeleyBatch` and `BerkeleyDatabase` no longer be friend classes.\r\n\r\nThe diff of this PR is currently the same as in ##18971\r\n\r\nRequires #19334",

          "body": "A `WalletDatabase` abstract class is created from `BerkeleyDatabase` and is implemented by `BerkeleyDatabase`. First, to get to the point that this is possible, 4 functions need to be added to `BerkeleyDatabase`: `AddRef`, `RemoveRef`, `Open`, and `Close`.\r\n\r\nFirst the increment and decrement of `mapFileUseCount` is refactored into separate functions `AddRef` and `RemoveRef`.\r\n\r\n`Open` is introduced as a dummy function. This will raise an exception so that it always fails.\r\n\r\n`Close` is refactored from `Flush`. The `shutdown` argument in `Flush` is removed and instead `Flush(true)` is now the `Close` function.\r\n\r\nSplit from #18971\r\n\r\nRequires #19325",

          "body": "This PR fixes tests for when BDB is not compiled. Tests which rely on or test legacy wallet behavior are disabled and skipped when BDB is not compiled. For the components of some tests that are for legacy wallet things, those parts of the tests are skipped.\r\n\r\nFor the majority of tests, changes are made so that they can be run with either legacy wallets or descriptor wallets without materially effecting the test. Most tests only need the wallet for balance and transactions, so the type of wallet is not an important part of those tests. Additionally, some tests are wallet agnostic and modified to instead use the test framework's MiniWallet.",

New\nCWallet::SetAddressReceiveRequest() implementation avoids a bug in\nCWallet::AddDestData() where a modification would leave the previous\nvalue in memory while writing the new value to disk. But it doesn't\nmatter because the GUI doesn't currently expose the ability to modify\nreceive requests, only to add and erase them.",

Internally, only change in behavior is that EraseDestData deletes directly from database because the `StringMap` is gone. This is more direct and efficient because it uses a single btree lookup and scan instead of multiple lookups\n\nMotivation for this cleanup is making changes like #18550, #18192, #13756 easier to reason about and less likely to result in unintended behavior and bugs",

          "body": "Currently when we load a wallet, we just iterate through all of the records in the database and add them completely statelessly. However we have some records which do rely on other records being loaded before they are. To deal with this, we use `CWalletScanState` to hold things temporarily until all of the records have been read and then we load the stateful things.\r\n\r\nHowever this can be slow, and with some future improvements, can cause some pretty drastic slowdowns to retain this pattern. So this PR changes the way we load records by choosing to load the records in a particular order. This lets us do things such as loading a descriptor record, then finding and loading that descriptor's cache and key records. In the future, this will also let us use `IsMine` when loading transactions as then `IsMine` will actually be working as we now always load keys and descriptors before transactions.\r\n\r\nIn order to get records of a specific type, this PR includes some refactors to how we do database cursors. Functionality is also added to retrieve a cursor that will give us records beginning with a specified prefix.\r\n\r\nLastly, one thing that iterating the entire database let us do was to find unknown records. However even if unknown records were found, we would not do anything with this information except output a number in a log line. With this PR, we would no longer be aware of any unknown records. This does not change functionality as we don't do anything with unknown records, and having unknown records is not an error. Now we would just not be aware that unknown records even exist.",

Benefits of the cleanup are:\r\n\r\n- Removes awkward `StringMap` intermediate representation for wallet address metadata.\r\n- Simplifies `CWallet`, deals with used address and received request serialization in `walletdb.cpp` instead of higher level wallet code\r\n- Adds test coverage and documentation\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change externally observable behavior. Internally, the only change in behavior is that `EraseDestData` deletes rows directly from the database because they are no longer stored in memory. This is more direct and efficient because it uses a single lookup and scan instead of multiple lookups.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this cleanup is making changes like #18550, #18192, #13756 easier to reason about and less likely to result in unintended behavior and bugs\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rebased copy of #18608. For some reason that PR is locked and couldn't be reopened or commented on.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an alternative to #27215 with differences described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27215#pullrequestreview-1329028143\r\n",

I wanted to ask why it was closed and whether #27125 might be a replacement for it. The other was my own PR #18608, which I wanted to reopen, but couldn't (even though the branch commit was unchanged at the time), so I opened another PR #27224, and now I can't comment on #18608 to say that it's been replaced by #27224.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the restrictions on comments are an anti-spam measure, so I wonder if there is a technical fix that would allow ordinary project members to comment on closed PRs like these?\r\n\r\nFWIW the messages I see on these two PRs are \"fanquake locked and limited conversation to collaborators 3 weeks ago\" and \"DrahtBot locked as resolved and limited conversation to collaborators on Aug 16, 2022\"",
