Closing this PR :)\r\n\r\n@marcofalke\r\n\r\n> In general I agree with @fanquake that documentation to compile with any imaginable compiler or checker or sanitizer or ... should probably be maintained outside of this repository. The project here is too big and moving too slow to keep every single piece of documentation up-to-date at all times. Also, we should be considerate of the precious review resource in this repository and use it on Bitcoin Core itself and not on integration of Bitcoin Core with meta developer tools.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think we as a project have historically vastly underused the available tooling that is typically used in security critical projects to tame C++ (sanitizers, etc.). In other words I don't think we run the risk of using, integrating or documenting \"too much\" tooling (quite the opposite TBH!), but I see your point regarding moving the documentation to another repo :)",
