    "body": "This one's really subtle. Fixes #5910. Confirmed fixed in gitian.\n\nSee here for background: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-34748\n\nlibxcb temporarily had an abi breakage which caused crashes when qt was compiled against a non-compatible version. Building qt with -qt-xcb should have shielded us from this issue, except that incompatible headers were used when building qt's wrapper.\n\nMake sure those headers aren't picked up by qt's build.\n\nDetails:\n\nqt's build adds a wrapper around the xcb libs when -qt-xcb is used. This is done to avoid having to link to a handful of different libs, which may not be api/abi stable. This build depends on include-order, so that its files are found before the real libxcb headers.\n\nOur build (for other reasons related to qt's complicated build-system) injects our prefix into CXXFLAGS. Because libxcb is found in this path, that reverses the include-order, negating the purpose of the wrapper.\n\nTo fix, libxcb's includes are simply moved to a subdir. pkg-config ensures that they're still found properly when needed.\n\nTo make things even more interesting, this behavior in qt's .pro files is broken:\nINCLUDEPATH += $$QMAKE_CFLAGS_XCB\n\nThe INCLUDEPATH variable is processed by qmake which automatically prefixes each entry with \"-I\". The QMAKE_CFLAGS_XCB variable comes from pkg-config and already contains -I, making the path look like \"-I-I/path/to/xcb/headers\".\n\nTo work around that, CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS are used here rather than INCLUDEPATH.\n",

      "message": "depends: fix a static qt5 crash when using certain versions of libxcb\n\nSee here for background: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-34748\n\nlibxcb temporarily had an abi breakage which caused crashes when qt was\ncompiled against a non-compatible version. Building qt with -qt-xcb should have\nshielded us from this issue, except that incompatible headers were used when\nbuilding qt's wrapper.\n\nMake sure those headers aren't picked up by qt's build.\n\nDetails:\n\nqt's build adds a wrapper around the xcb libs when -qt-xcb is used. This is\ndone to avoid having to link to a handful of different libs, which may not be\napi/abi stable. This build depends on include-order, so that its files are\nfound before the real libxcb headers.\n\nOur build (for other reasons related to qt's complicated build-system) injects\nour prefix into CXXFLAGS. Because libxcb is found in this path, that reverses\nthe include-order, negating the purpose of the wrapper.\n\nTo fix, libxcb's includes are simply moved to a subdir. pkg-config ensures that\nthey're still found properly when needed.\n\nTo make things even more interesting, this behavior in qt's .pro files is broken:\nINCLUDEPATH += $$QMAKE_CFLAGS_XCB\n\nThe INCLUDEPATH variable is processed by qmake which automatically prefixes each\nentry with \"-I\". The QMAKE_CFLAGS_XCB variable comes from pkg-config and\nalready contains -I, making the path look like \"-I-I/path/to/xcb/headers\".\n\nTo work around that, CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS are used here rather than INCLUDEPATH.",
