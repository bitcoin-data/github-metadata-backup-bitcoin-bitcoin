The initial reasoning that 1650 is an implicit\r\nlimit(would not reach assuming all other policy rules are being\r\nfollowed) is outdated.\r\n\r\nAs we now know, bitcoin transactions can have spend conditions are more than\r\njust signatures and there may exist p2sh transactions involving 100 byte\r\npreimages that maybe non-standard because of this rule. Because this\r\nrule is no longer implicit, we should explicitly document it in policy\r\nheader file\r\n\r\n",

The initial reasoning that 1650 is an implicit\nlimit(would not reached assuming all other policy rules are being\nfollowed) is outdated.\n\nAs we now know, bitcoin transactions can have spend conditions are more than\njust signatures and there may exist p2sh transactions involving 100 byte\npreimages that maybe non-standard because of this rule. Because this\nrule is no longer implicit, we should explicitly document it in policy\nheader file",
