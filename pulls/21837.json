    "body": "This proof of concept PR (leveraging work done by Cory Fields & Jeremy Rubin, see #16834) replaces the [rolling bloom filter](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2448457cca1858c2fcf3dfcb53de3f388ea72079/src/bloom.cpp#L173) used for [`m_addr_known`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2448457cca1858c2fcf3dfcb53de3f388ea72079/src/net.h#L550) with a [Cuckoo Filter written in Rust](https://github.com/axiomhq/rust-cuckoofilter). I've have made some minor build related adjustments to the Rust code, which can be seen here: https://github.com/fanquake/rust-cuckoofilter/tree/cabi_build_adjustments.\r\n\r\nSee [\"Cuckoo Filter: Practically Better Than Bloom\"](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/cuckoo-conext2014.pdf):\r\n\r\n> In many networking systems, Bloom filters are used for high-speed set membership tests. They permit a small fraction of false positive answers with very good space efficiency. However, they do not permit deletion of items from the set, and previous attempts to extend “standard” Bloom filters to support deletion all degrade either space or performance.\r\n\r\n> We propose a new data structure called the cuckoo filter that can replace Bloom filters for approximate set member- ship tests. Cuckoo filters support adding and removing items dynamically while achieving even higher performance than Bloom filters. \r\n\r\n> For applications that store many items and target moderately low false positive rates, cuckoo filters have lower space overhead than space-optimized Bloom filters. Our experimental results also show that cuckoo filters out-perform previous data structures that extend Bloom filters to support deletions substantially in both time and space.\r\n\r\nUsing this is a matter of:\r\n```bash\r\n./autogen.sh\r\n./configure --enable-experimental-rust\r\nmake\r\nmake -C src rusty-check\r\nsrc/bitcoind \r\n```\r\nNote that sometimes compilation will finish (i.e due to `ccache`) before `cargo` has finished generating the header and Rust lib, which will result in a compile error:\r\n```bash\r\n./net.h:43:10: fatal error: rusty/out/rcf_cuckoofilter.h: No such file or directory\r\n   43 | #include <rusty/out/rcf_cuckoofilter.h>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case you can just re-run `make`. Has been tested on macOS and Linux. Sometimes `p2p_getaddr_caching.py` fails, because the number of records returned falls a few short of `MAX_ADDR_TO_SEND`. Need investigating.\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting that this be merged as-is, or that this is the ideal way of integrating Rust code (i.e copying sources in tree, using `cbindgen`), into Bitcoin Core. What I am suggesting is that the Rust discussion should continue, particularly in regards to integrations that can be done in a very non-invasive / modular fashion.\r\n\r\nDoesn't crash, but may catch your machine on fire 🔥, use with caution. More Rust related discussion available in #17090.",

      "body": "> What I am suggesting is that the Rust discussion should continue, particularly in regards to integrations that can be done in a very non-invasive / modular fashion.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if net processing is the right place for a rust playground. It might be better to allow devs to write some non-production code in rust. For example, let them write the unit tests in rust if they wish to do so. This wouldn't be much different than the option to write tests today in either C++ or Python.\r\n\r\nI understand that your goal is to make the newly added code optional by effectively duplicating it, but the more-than-doubling of the review and maintenance burden is reason enough to Approach NACK this pull. Wasn't one of the suggestions last time this came up to have a separate net-processing module written in rust that speaks with Bitcoin Core to give it blocks (completely separate from the existing C++ net-processing)?",

      "body": "I don't have too much opinion on the Rust integration side of things. If that's a direction people want to go in, integration of a existing, functioning, library with a limited interface is probably one of the better places to start. As @MarcoFalke says, something test-only at first might be even better.\n\nRegarding cuckoo filters... they're great, and there are really nice ways of using them for rolling probabilistic data structures.\n\nI don't think this library is really what we want though. As I understand it, it deletes random elements when they overflow. That implies that there is basically 0 minimal retaining time for elements in the filter. For m_addr_known I don't think that matters very much, but we have half a dozen other RollingBloomFilters, and for some of them the guaranteed time of retaining matters.\n\nI'm a bit biased here of course; @gmaxwell and I have done some research on constructing a rolling cuckoo filter, and found a way to build one with pretty good properties. I have a old branch, but it may be a while before I get it picked up again.",
