    "body": "The block policy estimator currently assumes that a miner is incentivized to include a transaction only by its own fee. That is if a tracked transaction `A` with a feerate of `1sat/vb` is confirmed because it was CPFP'd by a child transaction `B` with a feerate of `20sat/vb` it will happily fill its 1ksat/kvb bucket with a success confirmation. Note that `B` isn't tracked as it has in-mempool ancestors.\r\n\r\nThis is concerning as it would not only miss part of the data necessary to provide a correct (higher) estimate (as it's the case for RBF, cf  #22539) but it would wrongly assume an incorrect (lower) estimate was right. It is even more concerning if we take into account that estimating a too low fee could have security implications for protocols requiring timely confirmation of transactions.\r\n\r\nOf course, the estimation would only get worse as CPFP is increasingly used on the network. But it *is* actively used currently [0] on the network, many applications allow for this functionality directly [1] or indirectly [2]. And with the increasing usage of L2s such as the Lightning Network, we can expect the CPFP usage to increase even more as [fee bumping methods get more common](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/688). Interestingly, with the current estimator the more anchor output-based fee bumping (shifting the fees from the parent to a child transaction) are used on the network the less the estimation will be reliable for everyone.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a naive implementation for accounting for child transaction(s) feerates when a parent transaction gets confirmed in `CBlockPolicyEstimator`'s `processBlock`. It would fail to split the feerate if multiple parents share the same child and assign the whole package (but the other parent(s)) feerate to the first seen parent. Accurate tracking would introduce way more complexity.\r\n\r\n[0] TODO: Provide some raw data about historical usage of CPFP\r\n\r\n[1] For instance Bluewallet, LND, Mycelium and SparrowWallet do. And Lightning implems recommend to do a CPFP if the funding transaction doesn't confirm in a timely manner until we have [an upgrade of the funding protocol allow for RBF](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/851). \r\n\r\n[2] For lots of wallets include the Bitcoin Core one during a fee spike users continue to transact using unconfirmed UTxOs with transactions of increasing feerate (and even sometimes open an issue because they hit the descendants limit).",

Assuming we have both https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22539 and this PR this would give a much more correct estimation: taking the entire package feerate instead of ignoring it (#22539), or wrongly assuming the feerate of the parent transaction alone was enough to get it confirmed (this PR).",

      "body": "IIUC, our fee estimator is tracking feerate + time to confirm so that we can estimate the probability of a transaction confirming within `n` blocks when offered at feerate `f`. I definitely agree it's incorrect to use base feerates, as CPFP transactions cause us underestimate feerates. So, again, strong concept ACK.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure about the approach. Looking at a block transaction and its descendants can tell us the feerate at which it was mined, but not the feerate it was offered at. We wouldn't know when it was fee-bumped and how long it took to mine after the high-fee descendant(s) were broadcast (which imo is what we're actually interested in).\r\n\r\nIn our code, we essentially think of \"miner attractiveness\" as the ancestor feerate of a transaction (not saying this is the perfect or only way to think about it, just going off of `BlockAssembler`).\r\n\r\nI also don't think it's necessarily bad to include transactions in fee estimation when they have mempool ancestors, as long as everybody's feerates are accurately accounted for.\r\n\r\nIf I might propose a different approach: for every transaction added to mempool, add it to the fee estimator by ancestor feerate, and update height and feerate of its ancestors' entries if it improves them. This captures our intent: the transaction is being re-offered at a higher feerate. (Same thing for RBF in #22539, which is already implemented this way - new feerate and new time).\r\n\r\nWhen the transaction is included in a block, we can use `blocksToConfirm = nBlockHeight - offerHeight` where offerHeight is not the time it first entered the mempool, but the time it was \"offered\" to a miner at its best feerate.",

Will give this approach a go, hopefully in the coming weeks!",

That would be inaccurate, since it was 1sat/vB for most of that time.",
