    "body": "Currently inactive HD chains are only derived from at the time a key in that chain is found to have been used. However, at that time, the wallet may not be able to derive keys (e.g. it is locked). Currently we would just move on and not derive any new keys, however this could result in missing funds.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves this problem by adding memory only variables to `CHDChain` which track the highest known index. `TopUp` is modified to always try to top up the inactive HD chains, and this process will use the new variables to determine how much to top up. In this way, after an encrypted wallet is unlocked, the inactive HD chains will be topped up and hopefully funds will not be missed.\r\n\r\nNote that because these variables are not persisted to disk (because `CHDChain`s for inactive HD chains are not written to disk), if an encrypted wallet is not unlocked in the same session as a key from an inactive chain is found to be used, then it will not be topped up later unless more keys are found.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, wallets which do not have upgraded key metadata will not derive any keys from inactive HD chains. This is resolved by using the derivation path string in `CKeyMetadata.hdKeypath` to determine what indexes to derive.",
