See the [`libFuzzer` documentation for details](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html).\r\n* Create the three configuration files `project.yaml`, `Dockerfile` and `build.sh` as described in the [`OSS-Fuzz` new project guide](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/docs/new_project_guide.md) and submit an `OSS-Fuzz` pull request.\r\n\r\nToday [Google announced that they offer $1k to $20k in rewards for properly integrated project](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/05/oss-fuzz-five-months-later-and.html).\r\n\r\nHave a nice vacation and enjoy the warm fuzzy feeling of having helped secure the Bitcoin network! :-)",

More specifically it adds fuzzing of the deserialization code for `BlockTransactions`, `BlockTransactionsRequest` and `CBlockHeaderAndShortTxIDs`.\r\n\r\nDo you think it might be getting ready for merge?\r\n\r\nWhen this PR is merged I'll look into having command-line argument determine the type of fuzzer as suggested in #11045.\r\n\r\n",
