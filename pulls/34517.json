    "body": "As planned!\r\n\r\nAlso bump trusted-git-root to 88a7294356e75bbaa136c9427c64e239f7c6fd40, which is the last merge signed with this key.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I didn’t plan to write a \"statement\" but I keep getting asked to comment:\r\n\r\nI was added as a maintainer ~3.5 years ago in recognition that mempool needed extra attention and work. It is a sensitive area of the codebase with painful tradeoffs and attracted stop energy from many angles. With package relay, TRUC + other policy features, cluster mempool, and a number of other projects shipping, I’m happy with what we’ve achieved for L2 security and mining decentralization. Here is a natural stopping point for a mempool maintainer.\r\n\r\nOver the last decade, Bitcoin Core has seen dozens of brigaded mempool policy PRs (covered to varying degrees by media). I've had the privilege of authoring, reviewing, moderating and/or merging the vast majority of them in the last 4 years and each one has strengthened the project's resistance to harassment. I cannot say the same for myself and my family, but it is an **honor** to receive so much personal recognition for my impact on Bitcoin Core's decision-making process and p2p code.\r\n\r\nI have deep respect for the skill of capturing people’s attentions/emotions. But the choice between integrity and engagement has always been an obvious one to me, and a privilege to be able to make as a maintainer of this project.",
