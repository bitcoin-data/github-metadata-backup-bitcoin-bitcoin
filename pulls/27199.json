      "body": "Yes, I have implemented this both for `walletlock` and `walletpassphrasechange` to ensure that this error is raised in both. However, it is important to note that this test now tests something slightly different than what it did previously. Previously this checked that the wallet was still able to complete a full rescan even if an attempt was made to relock the wallet (because of the timeout in `walletpassphrase`). This new test does not test this because other than using the `walletpassphrase` I can't think of another method of deleting the passphrase from memory without having an error thrown. That being said, this adds coverage for something that was not previously tested (encryption RPCs throwing errors during a rescan, also introduced in #26347 ) and removes the race condition, so I think this is an improvement.",
