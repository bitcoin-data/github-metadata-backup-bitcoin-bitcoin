    "body": "This is part of the [assumeutxo project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/11) (parent PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606)\r\n\r\nPart two of replacing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24232.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen a user activates a snapshot, the serialized UTXO set data is used to create an \"assumed-valid\" chainstate, which becomes active in an attempt to get the node to network tip as quickly as possible. Simultaneously in the background, the already-existing chainstate continues \"conventional\" IBD to both accumulate full block data and serve as a belt-and-suspenders to validate the assumed-valid chainstate.\r\n\r\nOnce the background chainstate's tip reaches the base block of the snapshot used, we set `m_stop_use` on that chainstate and immediately take the hash of its UTXO set; we verify that this matches the assumeutxo value in the source code. Note that while we ultimately want to remove this background chainstate, we don't do so until the following initialization process, when we again check the UTXO set hash of the background chainstate, and if it continues to match, we remove the (now unnecessary) background chainstate, and move the (previously) assumed-valid chainstate into its place. We then reinitialize the chainstate in the normal way.\r\n\r\nAs noted in previous comments, we could do the filesystem operations \"inline\" immediately when the background validation completes, but that's basically just an optimization that saves disk space until the next restart. It didn't strike me as worth the risk of moving chainstate data around on disk during runtime of the node, though maybe my concerns are overblown.\r\n\r\nThe final result of this completion process is a fully-validated chain, where the only evidence that the user synced using assumeutxo is the existence of a `base_blockhash` file in the `chainstate` directory.\r\n",

(_perhaps PR description should be updated_).\r\n\r\nSome logic I could understand:\r\n![assumeutxo2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19480819/222829606-2c2d943c-35a9-48f4-bccd-0cca56d62e10.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn e91b2165103784f13316e513d03dda0d63570675, it first added in `CompleteChainstateInitialization`\r\n```cpp\r\nassert(chainman.m_total_coinstip_cache > 0);\r\nassert(chainman.m_total_coinsdb_cache > 0);\r\n```\r\nGood to check we have enough bytes available for in-memory coins caches and leveldb stuff.\r\n\r\nIn `LoadChainstate` I could check (what is mentioned):\r\n1. Loads the fully validated chainstate\r\n2. Loads a chain created from a UTXO snapshot, if any exist.\r\n\r\nWith both ones, it calls `MaybeCompleteSnapshotValidation` to compare the background chainstate's UTXO hash with the hard-coded (and expected) one. If so, it sets `m_disabled=true`. And then, we can _re-_initialize the chainstate (`InitializeChainstate`).\r\n\r\nIf we could have `loadtxoutset` (as mentioned by @Sjors), it would be good to review it and see things happen in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It seems like if you do restart the snapshot will just fail to validate again which should be safe because it will either succesfully rename, or show the same error message again. Maybe better to say what to do instead of what not to do like \"Rename of invalid chainstate '%s' -> '%s' failed. Node may refuse to start until bad chainstate is manually renamed or deleted.\"",
