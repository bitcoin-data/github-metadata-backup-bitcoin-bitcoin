    "body": "Connecting to an I2P peer consists of creating a session (the\r\n`SESSION CREATE` command) and then connecting to the peer using that\r\nsession (`STREAM CONNECT ID=session_id ...`).\r\n\r\nThis change is only relevant for transient sessions because when a\r\npersistent session is used it is created once and used for all\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\nBefore this change Bitcoin Core would create the session and use it in\r\nquick succession. That is, the `SESSION CREATE` command would be\r\nimmediately followed by `STREAM CONNECT`. This could ease network\r\nactivity monitoring by an adversary.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate that, this change creates sessions upfront without an\r\nimmediate demand for new sessions and later uses them. This creates a\r\ntime gap between `SESSION CREATE` and `STREAM CONNECT`. Note that there\r\nis always some demand for new I2P connections due to disconnects.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSummary of the changes in the code:\r\n\r\n* Create the session from the `Session` constructor (send `SESSION CREATE`\r\n  to the I2P SAM proxy). This constructor was only called when transient\r\n  sessions were needed and was immediately followed by `Connect()` which\r\n  would have created the session. So this is a noop change if viewed\r\n  in isolation.\r\n\r\n* Every time we try to connect to any peer (not just I2P) create a new\r\n  I2P session, up to a limit (currently 10). This way a bunch of\r\n  sessions are created (`SESSION CREATE`) at times that are decoupled\r\n  from the time when sessions will be used (`STREAM CONNECT`).\r\n\r\n* Tweak the code in `CConnman::ConnectNode()` to avoid creating session\r\n  objects while holding `m_unused_i2p_sessions_mutex` because now\r\n  creating `i2p::sam::Session` involves network activity and could take\r\n  a few seconds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBefore (note the timestamps):\r\n\r\n2025-03-13T09:23:40Z [opencon] [i2p:info] Transient SAM session cd7ea49a7e created\r\n2025-03-13T09:23:43Z [opencon] [i2p] -> STREAM CONNECT ID=cd7ea49a7e DESTINATION=...\r\n\r\n2025-03-13T09:23:51Z [opencon] [i2p:info] Transient SAM session cb0956207e created\r\n2025-03-13T09:23:52Z [opencon] [i2p] -> STREAM CONNECT ID=cb0956207e DESTINATION=...\r\n\r\n2025-03-13T09:24:04Z [opencon] [i2p:info] Transient SAM session 35ad67f343 created\r\n2025-03-13T09:24:04Z [opencon] [i2p] -> STREAM CONNECT ID=35ad67f343 DESTINATION=...\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n2025-03-13T17:08:58Z [opencon] [i2p:info] Transient SAM session 16098cd4ea created\r\n2025-03-13T17:09:34Z [opencon] [i2p] -> STREAM CONNECT ID=16098cd4ea DESTINATION=...\r\n\r\n2025-03-13T17:09:38Z [opencon] [i2p:info] Transient SAM session 5d209bf1bc created\r\n2025-03-13T17:09:59Z [opencon] [i2p] -> STREAM CONNECT ID=5d209bf1bc DESTINATION=...\r\n\r\n2025-03-13T17:09:50Z [opencon] [i2p:info] Transient SAM session e78aa6d2e7 created\r\n2025-03-13T17:12:09Z [opencon] [i2p] -> STREAM CONNECT ID=e78aa6d2e7 DESTINATION=...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis was suggested by @eyedeekay some time ago (in 2023 actually) and has been lingering in my TODO since then :eyes:. A further suggestion is to also add a time gap between the activity cease and the closing of the session. For this, when `CNode` is destroyed `CNode::m_i2p_sam_session` would have to be moved elsewhere and destroyed at a later time. cc @zzzi2p",

That is, the `SESSION CREATE` command would be\nimmediately followed by `STREAM CONNECT`. This could ease network\nactivity monitoring by an adversary.\n\nTo mitigate that, this change creates sessions upfront without an\nimmediate demand for new sessions and later uses them. This creates a\ntime gap between `SESSION CREATE` and `STREAM CONNECT`. Note that there\nis always some demand for new I2P connections due to disconnects.\n\n---\n\nSummary of the changes in the code:\n\n* Create the session from the `Session` constructor (send `SESSION CREATE`\n  to the I2P SAM proxy). This constructor was only called when transient\n  sessions were needed and was immediately followed by `Connect()` which\n  would have created the session. So this is a noop change if viewed\n  in isolation.\n\n* Every time we try to connect to any peer (not just I2P) create a new\n  I2P session, up to a limit (currently 10). This way a bunch of\n  sessions are created (`SESSION CREATE`) at times that are decoupled\n  from the time when sessions will be used (`STREAM CONNECT`).\n\n* Tweak the code in `CConnman::ConnectNode()` to avoid creating session\n  objects while holding `m_unused_i2p_sessions_mutex` because now\n  creating `i2p::sam::Session` involves network activity and could take\n  a few seconds.\n",

If your I2P connections limit is 10, then you're doubling your network resource usage. 2 or 3 is probably enough, depending on how fast your connections churn and how long is long enough for a unused session to be up to give you the anonymity you're looking for.\r\n\r\nA couple of alternatives:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint max = MAX_UNUSED_I2P_SESSIONS_SIZE;\r\nif (uptime() > 15 minutes) max /= 3;\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint max = min(MAX_UNUSED_I2P_SESSIONS_SIZE,  3 + MAX_I2P_SESSIONS - current_i2p_sessions.size());\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm also concerned about starting a whole bunch of sessions at once, especially at startup, and if the user started his router when he started bitcoin.  If this change will double or triple or more the session-creation rate at startup, that's probably too fast. The  Java router has some tunnel build rate-limiting that may kick in. I won't attempt any pseudocode for it, but some rate limiting in AddI2PSessionsIfNeeded() or some other special case for the first few minutes after startup is probably desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcept ACK.\r\n\r\n",

I think the best method of managing the session bank sort of depends on the rate at which you'll need them.\r\n\r\nIf you're creating sessions fast enough to need a bank of 10 sessions, then I think at some point you have no choice but to keep the sessions alive longer and re-use them more. On the other hand, if you aren't creating them fast enough to need a bank of 10 sessions, then keeping a bank of 10 of them is pretty wasteful. How you solve it is going to depend on the actual rates you expect people to need sessions. If the need for sessions is too unpredictable, then maybe the bank size limit needs to change size based on need from a very small number to a larger number and back.\r\n\r\nI'm going to take a closer look at the code here and try to make some more concrete suggestions.",
