    "body": "This PR improves correctness (removing potentially unsafe `const_cast`s) and flexibility of the serialization code.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that use of the current `ADD_SERIALIZE_METHODS` macro (which is the only way to not duplicate serialization and deserialization code) only expands to a single class method, and thus can only be qualified as either const or non-const - not both. In many cases, serialization needs to work on const objects however, and preferably that is done without casts that could hide const-correctness bugs.\r\n\r\nTo deal with that, this PR introduces a new approach that includes a `SERIALIZE_METHODS(obj)` macro, where `obj` is a variable name. It expands to some boilerplate and a static method to which the object itself is an argument. The advantage is that its type can be templated, and be `const` when serializing.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is the various serialization-wrapping macros (`VARINT`, `COMPACTSIZE`, `FLATDATA` and `LIMITED_STRING`). They all `const_cast` their argument in order to construct a wrapper object, which supports both serialization and deserialization. This PR makes them templated in the underlying data type (for example, `CompactSizeWrapper<uint64_t>`). This has the advantage that we can make the template type `const` when invoked on a `const` variable (so it would be `CompactSizeWrapper<const uint64_t>` in that case).\r\n\r\nA last issue is the persistent use of the `REF` macro to deal with temporary expressions being passed in. Since C++11, this is not needed anymore as temporaries are explicitly represented as rvalue references. Thus we can remove `REF` invocations and instead just make the various classes and helper functions deal correctly with references.\r\n\r\nThe above changes permit a fully const-correct version of all serialization code. However, it is cumbersome. Any existing `ADD_SERIALIZE_METHODS` instances in the code that do more than just (conditionally) serializing/deserializing some fields (in particular, it contains branches that assign to some of the variables) need to be split up into an explicit `Serialize` and `Unserialize` method instead. In some cases this is inevitable (wallet serializers do some crazy transformations while serializing!), but in many cases it is just annoying duplication.\r\n\r\nTo improve upon this, a few more primitives that are currently inlined are turned into serialization wrappers:\r\n* `BigEndianWrapper`: Serializes/deserializes an integer as big endian rather than little endian (only for 16-bit). This permits the CService serialization to become a oneliner.\r\n* `Uint48Wrapper`: Serializes/deserializes only the lower 48 bits of an integer (used in BIP152 code).\r\n* `VectorApplyWrapper`: Serializes/deserializes a vector while using a custom serializer for its elements. This simplifies the undo and blockencoding serializers a lot.\r\n\r\nBest of all, it removes 147 lines of while code adding a bunch of comments (though the increased use of vararg `READWRITE` is probably cheating a bit).\r\n\r\nThe commits are ordered into 3 sections:\r\n* First, introduce new classes that permit const-correct serialization.\r\n* Then one by one transform the various files to use the new serializers.\r\n* Finally, remove the old serializers.\r\n\r\nThis may be too much to go in at once. I'm happy to split things up as needed.",

As a result, there are many invocations of the `REF` macro which in addition to changing the reference type also changes the constness. This is unnecessary in C++11 as we can use rvalue references now instead.\r\n\r\nThe first commit is an extra simplification we can make that removes the duplication of code between `READWRITE` and `READWRITEMANY` (and related functions).",

          "body": "With the new `AsType` function it's possible to serialize an object as another (compatible) type, and is intended for invoking the serializer of a parent class.\r\n\r\nWriting `AsType<Parent>(child)` will work in any context:\r\n* `READWRITE(AsType<Parent>(child))`\r\n* `s << AsType<Parent>(child)`\r\n* `s >> AsType<Parent>(child)`\r\n\r\nIn case child is `const`, the result will be a reference to a `const Parent` type, resulting in const-correct behavior.\r\n\nFor now this primitive isn't very useful, as the constness is statically known in each of the instances (so a simple cast would work). However, in #10785 I plan to modify the serialization code to have a single implementation which works on a const object when serializing and non-const when deserializing. `AsType` behaves correctly in this case, maintaining the constness of the argument. It's also safer, as this only involves automatic type conversions, and no explicit casts.",

      "body": "Just reviewed commit \"Switch to different wrapping model + different differential vector\" (7da03b3ce5f4be94555b15bf4668bc251a8faac4) and I think it is a nice improvement. Getting rid of the various `Format::Wrapper` inner classes and pulling them into a standalone `Wrapper` class eliminates redundant code. And another really nice part of the change is replacing the `Differential` struct that had lots of operator overloads with simpler value function transform objects.\r\n\r\nI did have some ideas and suggestions from looking at this, but feel free to take or leave them:\r\n\r\n1. \"Wrapper\" terminology doesn't seem helpful when it isn't specifically referring to the actual wrapper class. Would maybe refer to the various classes that have `Ser` and `Unser` methods as formatters or helpers instead of wrappers since they don't really wrap anything. Similarly might rename `Wrap` function to `SerializeAs` or `FormatAs` and rename `W` template arguments to `F` or `H`.\r\n2. I don't think there's a reason to require `Ser` and `Unser` methods to be static. It should be no problem to just call `W()::Ser()` instead of `W::Ser()` inside the new `Wrapper` class, and not requiring the methods to be static could be beneficial if the formatter/helper objects are used other contexts in the future. For example if a compression formatter was used to serialize many elements in a data structure, maybe it could save some state to avoid repeating work.",

What so you think of the name \"Using\" instead of \"Wrap\" ?\r\n\r\nI think it'd be good, assuming it's not too much trouble to rename. I also realized the names I suggested yesterday `SerializeAs` or `FormatAs` don't really make sense given how the template argument is used. More accurate would be `SerializeWith`, `FormatWith`, or `SerializeUsing`. No strong opinions about any of this, though.",

I'd like this so it'd be possible to add deserializing constructors here (like `CTransaction` has), so there could be a uniform way to deserialize objects without assuming they support default construction. But also a `class_name` argument would make the macro more flexible and future proof, so it'd be easy to do things like:\r\n\r\n- Adding stricter type checking (e.g. an `is_same<class_name, remove_const<Type>>` assert in SerializationOps to prevent usage errors or template bloat.\r\n- Logging or debugging with `#class_name`\r\n- Adding static or friend functions that reference `class_name`.",

I was actually going to suggest this same approach before I noticed there was a ser_action.ForRead method. ser_action could also have a method returning a reference instead of a pointer. I think any approach that would avoid duplicating serialization & deserialization would be good, though.\r\n\r\nFor IF_UNSERIALIZE, maybe consider getting of all the obj macro arguments:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n     SERIALIZE_METHODS(SomeType)\r\n     {\r\n          READWRITE(obj.member);\r\n          IF_UNSERIALIZE({obj.FillShortTxid();});\r\n     }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the obj arguments maybe help make serialize methods resemble normal methods, but don't actually add real utility.",
