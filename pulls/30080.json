    "body": "This PR replaces draft [PR 29442](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29442) as a simpler alternative that only adds new coin selection parameters, primarily `add_excess_to_recipient_position`.\r\n\r\nI am opening this PR as a draft to get feedback and suggestions on the concept and my implementation.\r\n\r\nI have also included two additional coin selection parameters to this PR for specifying the target change amount and for disabling different coin selection algorithms. I can break them out into individual PRs if the primary excess amount coin selection option would be easier to review on its own. These additional parameters can also help lower fees for the LSP liquidity provider use case.\r\n\r\n### motivation\r\n\r\nA changeless transaction may select inputs with excess value over what is needed to reach the desired fee rate and output targets. Currently that excess value is considered waste and burned as fees. In some situations you may prefer to add any excess value to an output you control. When fees are high the cost of adding a change output increases and so does the amount of potential excess value spent as fees. One example of a situation where excess value should be added to the output amount is when splicing in value to a Lightning channel because the excess value is retained off-chain.",

      "body": "Here are my initial thoughts on each of the options individually\r\n\r\n`change_target`\r\nIIUC you want a specific min value for the change UTXO. Would a following alternative work? You provide your change address in the list of recipients with desired min amount and specify it as change UTXO using `change_position`parameter. The downside compared to a new option is that we always have a change output. Not sure if that's a problem in your case.\r\n\r\n`disable_algos`\r\nThis makes sense, and could be a first step to pluggable coin selection in core. But it should be in settings, not in RPC parameters. I doubt many users need to change it at runtime and so it's better to keep the RPC parameters to a minimum.\r\n\r\n`add_excess_to_recipient_position`\r\nThis options seems like a compromise that makes nobody happy. From your perspective you're okay to overfund a channel, but you have no control by how much, since excess is not configurable. From the perspective of users not doing splicing, this option is not useful at all.\r\n\r\nIt seems like what you really want is to search for a changeless solution in a given target range. And then if failed to fallback to a solution with change.\r\n\r\n",

          "title": "wallet: Target a pre-defined utxo set composition by adjusting change outputs",
          "body": "This PR is designed for the use case of a Lightning node that provides liquidity of predefined amounts via [liquidity ads](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/878).\r\n\r\nCoin selection is currently optimized to reduce the size of the utxo set and create change optimized for privacy. A liquidity provider instead needs to service multiple liquidity requests by spending confirmed utxos of known sizes.\r\n\r\nIdeally most liquidity transactions would be funded by a single input or a small set of inputs optimized to reduce fees. To minimize the number of unconfirmed transactions, inputs should also be sized in a range where most transactions do not produce change. When change is created, it should be divided into outputs of the sizes needed so that the wallet's utxo set converges towards an ideal utxo set specified by the user.\r\n\r\nI am opening this PR as a draft to get feedback and suggestions on the concept and my implementation to address this use case.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm described below can be implemented externally via RPC calls or directly in the wallet. \r\n\r\n1. Externally: use a new option to set the change target used for coin selection. \r\n2. Wallet (opportunistic): a new configuration file defines the desired utxo set which the wallet uses to compute the change target used for coin selection and to split change outputs (if any). \r\n4. Wallet (reactive/proactive):  pre-select a large input to force coin selection to produce change when fees are below some specified threshold or the desired set of utxos falls below some threshold. \r\n\r\n## utxo targets file example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"buckets\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 10000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 25000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 150\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 50000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 75000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 50\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 200000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 250000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 20\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"start_satoshis\": 1000000,\r\n            \"end_satoshis\": 1400000,\r\n            \"target_utxo_count\": 5\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"bucket_refill_feerate\": 30000\r\n}\r\n```\r\n - The `target_utxo_count` for a bucket should be larger than the anticipated number of liquidity requests of `bucket_start_satoshis` within the expected confirmation time of a liquidity transaction.\r\n - The range from `bucket_start_satoshis` to `bucket_end_satoshis` should encompass expected fee variance.\r\n - The `bucket_refill_feerate` should be set to the expected median fee rate (?).\r\n - This file will be reloaded for every spend request to allow for on-the-fly updates\r\n\r\n## Algorithm steps\r\n\r\nFor each payment do the following:\r\n\r\n1) Calculate the current capacity of each target bucket from the wallet's utxo set.\r\n    - Include outputs from both confirmed and unconfirmed transactions in the wallet to calculate capacity.\r\n2) Add our largest confirmed utxo as an input IF the capacity of the least full target bucket is below some threshold (eg. < 30% full) or less than some higher threshold (eg. < 70%) and fee rates are below the `bucket_refill_feerate`.\r\n    - When the largest confirmed utxo is from one of our target buckets, then we should refill our wallet with a utxo from cold storage.\r\n3) Set the minimum change target [`m_min_change_target`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3054416f62644120a4a6bc76e927054c7fbbd487/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L147) to a value from the target bucket with the lowest current capacity.\r\n    - Generate a random change target of the amount: current `change_fee` (the fee for creating an output) + a random value in the range: `bucket_start_satoshis` to `bucket_end_satoshi` - `change_fee`.\r\n    - Currently the change target is set by [`GenerateChangeTarget()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6ff0aa089c01ff3e610ecb47814ed739d685a14c/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L824) in a hard coded range.\r\n    - This parameter is only used by the 'knapsack' and 'coingrinder' algorithms.\r\n4) Call ['SelectCoins()'](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3054416f62644120a4a6bc76e927054c7fbbd487/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L1132) with the input from step 2 (if any) added to the `preset_inputs` parameter and with the minimum change target from step 3.\r\n    - The `consolidatefeerate=0` configuration option should always be set so that utxos are not preemptively cosolidated. Coin selection sets the parameter [`m_long_term_feerate`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/37fdf5a492786c1772b5b40773a1031237447070/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L160) to the wallets `consolidatefeerate`.\r\n    - Ideally, only the 'bnb' and 'cg' coin selection algorithms should be used and the others disabled to optimize for low fees.\r\n5) If the coin selection result includes a change output, then split the single change output amount into multiple outputs.\r\n    - Add the mimimum change target as an output first.\r\n    - If there is remaining value after paying the fee for a new output, then add a target from the next most empty target bucket.\r\n    - If there is not enough value to add a new output and fees, add remaining value to the last output added instead.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks for the feedback! I agree that it is worth considering how to make these parameters more useful for general users.\r\n\r\n> `change_target` IIUC you want a specific min value for the change UTXO. Would a following alternative work? You provide your change address in the list of recipients with desired min amount and specify it as change UTXO using `change_position`parameter. The downside compared to a new option is that we always have a change output. Not sure if that's a problem in your case.\r\n\r\nAlways having a change output would be a problem because we always prefer a changeless tx if the excess is not too large. But when that is not possible the change should be large enough to potentially spend later as a changeless tx.  \r\n\r\nA possible alternative would be to add a setting for CHANGE_LOWER rather than always use the hard coded value of 50,000 sats. It is probably not necessary for my use case to set the `change_target` every time we fund a tx; we can just make sure it is always above the minimum value we want for all of our UTXOs.\r\n\r\n> `disable_algos` This makes sense, and could be a first step to pluggable coin selection in core. But it should be in settings, not in RPC parameters. I doubt many users need to change it at runtime and so it's better to keep the RPC parameters to a minimum.\r\n\r\nI agree that generally it's too in the weeds for most users. I'll move it to settings.\r\n\r\n> `add_excess_to_recipient_position` This options seems like a compromise that makes nobody happy. From your perspective you're okay to overfund a channel, but you have no control by how much, since excess is not configurable. From the perspective of users not doing splicing, this option is not useful at all.\r\n\r\nGood point. The maximum excess currently built into BnB is `cost_of_change`, defined as the cost to create and spend a change output. This is an arbitrary value to use if you are happy to add some amount of excess to a changeless spend output. It would be better to also have a `max_excess` parameter that defaults to `cost_of_change` if not otherwise defined.\r\n \r\n> It seems like what you really want is to search for a changeless solution in a given target range. And then if failed to fallback to a solution with change.\r\n\r\nExactly! I believe that is how CS works now. If no set of inputs are found with excess in the range from zero to `cost_of_change` then BnB will fail and CS will fallback to a solution with change. But adding a new `max_excess` parameter would make it explicit what that range is.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of not over complicating the coin selection options, do you think it would be better to have two new options: `add_excess_to_recipient_position` and `max_excess`, OR just add `max_excess` and always default to add the excess to the first spending target?",
