    "body": "This code causes no functional difference to bitcoin.\n\nThe purpose of the pull is also to help make the code more readable by making variable names fit their function. \n1. The first commit moves the debug message for version number to before the disconnect logic so that the debug.log will show the version of nodes connected to, however briefly. This seems reasonable given that a version message is received - it now ensures it is logged.\n2. The second commit changed nServicesExpected so that it is what is in the address database, thereby making the variable function closer to the variable name.\n",

I'm a premature pusher it seems :-s\n\nAlso, as soon as I am happy with my code, I want to push it to my github account, but if I do that while the pull is closed, then I'm unable to re-open it, so I have to open it before pushing. But if I leave it open, other developers on github complain if it's not read enough, which sometime it isn't, so I close it until I am sure.\n\nIf there is a better way to do this, please let me know. The opening and closing seems to be due to a feature in github which locks the pull closed if pushes are done while it is closed :-s\n",

      "body": "It seems to me that nServicesExpected doesn't need to be mentioned here at all. It's irrelevant. It's simply what was advertised in the addresses messages. If nServices includes all the relevant services then surely the connection should remain. Firstly, the network selection code is such that if the relevant services wasn't present in ExpectedServices it wouldn't even have tried connecting to it. and secondly, even if the network selection code tries connecting to it, then as long as nServices (the latest update of what the node provides) includes the relevant services, the connection should remain even if the ExpectedServices (an out of date snapshot of what other nodes say the node provides) says it doesn't provide the service.\n\nI therefore propose changing this line to:-\n`if (nRelevantServices & ~pfrom->nServices) {`\n\nany objections?\n",
