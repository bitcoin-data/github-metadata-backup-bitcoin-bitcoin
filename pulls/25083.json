    "body": "Previously in COutput, effective_value was initialized as the absolute value of the txout and the fee as 0. effective_value along with the fee was calculated outside of the COutput constructor and set after the object had been initialized.\r\nThese changes will allow either the fee or the feerate to be passed in a COutput constructor and the fee and effective_value are calculated and set in the constructor. As a result, AvailableCoins also needs to be passed the feerate when utxos are being spent. When balance is calculated or the coins are being listed and feerate is neither available nor required, AvailableCoinsListUnspent is used instead, which runs AvailableCoins while providing the default value for `feerate`. Unit tests for the calculation of effective value have also been added.",

These changes will allow either the fee\nor the feerate to be passed in a COutput constructor. If either are\nprovided, fee and effective_value are calculated and set in the\nconstructor. As a result, AvailableCoins also needs to be passed the\nfeerate when utxos are being spent. When balance is calculated or the\ncoins are being listed and feerate is neither available nor required,\nAvailableCoinsListUnspent is used instead, which runs AvailableCoins\nwhile providing the default value for feerate. Unit tests for the\ncalculation of effective value have also been added.",

I notice that the parameter name would clash with the class member name, since they'd then both would be named `fee`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should use this PR as an opportunity to rename the class members of `COutput` to use the `m_` prefix as suggested by the [Style Guide](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#coding-style-c)? This would allow us to use `fee` for the parameter as the member variable would then be `COutput.m_fee`.",

What would need to happen for `fees` to be zero when `input_bytes` is greater than zero? IIRC, when SFFO is being used, we use the actual value of the UTXO instead of its effective value, so there too, a fee greater than zero should follow if both feerate and `input_bytes` are known. So, I wonder here whethere `fees = 0` only occurs in the context of tests, or whether this occurs perhaps also in the context of listing unspents outside of transaction building. If so, it could perhaps be mentioned in the comment here.",
