    "body": "This work creates CConnman. The idea is to begin moving data structures and functionality out of globals in net.h and into an instanced class, in order to avoid side-effects in networking code. Eventually, an (internal) api begins to emerge, and as long as the conditions of that api are met, the inner-workings may be a black box.\n\nFor now (for ease), a single global CConnman is created. Down the road, the instance could be passed around instead. Also, CConnman should be moved out of net.h/net.cpp, but that can be done in a separate move-only-ish step.\n\nA few todos remain here:\n- ~~there are `if(g_connman)`'s everywhere. A few places should assume that a connman is running (or it should be passed around). For example, ProcessMessages.~~\n- ~~GetRelayTx/RelayTransaction are awkward. Where should mapRelay live? Should it be dealt with directly rather than hidden inside of relay functions? (rebased on top of #8082)~~\n- ~~How to deal with CConnman parameters? Continue adding them to Start(), or have it parse the program options itself? (Created CConnman::Options)~~\n- ~~RPC needs a new error for dealing with the \"p2p not enabled\" case.~~\n\nTodos for a follow-up PR:\n- Actually create connman.h/cpp and move the class there.\n- Pass CConnman into QT similar to the wallet\n- ~~Drop StartNode/StopNode and just use CConnman::Stop/Start directly (Need to make sure that MapPort can be moved directly into Init without side-effects)~~\n- Pass CChainParams into CConnman and pass it around\n- ~~Create CConnmanOptions to reduce the verbosity of CConnman::Start()~~\n- Deal with fDiscover/fListen/etc in CConnman\n",

It actually has an inversion of cs_main/cs_filter; the conflicting locks are all taken in the same thread, but it's not good practice.\n\nThis uses a new mutex for the two Misbehavior()-related fields of CNodeState, and as an additional lock for mapNodeState. No other locks except addrman's (which is fully encapsulated) are taken while cs_misbehavior is held.\n\nAlso, tacked on the fix for the redundant variable from #7942 pointed out by @sipa.\n",

I guess this could be the reason that sometimes refs stay >0 no matter what and nodes stuck in `vNodesDisconnected` forever which means that node never get deleted and `FinalizeNode` signal is never fired which in its turn means that for example `mapBlocksInFlight` can't be cleaned properly and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7596 happens.\n\nThis commit should solve the issue by:\n1. removing `AddRef()` for existing connections\n2. adding `AddRef()` in `CNode`'s constructor using the same conditions as in `ThreadSocketHandler()`\n",

          "body": "This looks somewhat awkward as-is, but it's a part of the CConnman refactor. I've broken it out and PR'd separately because it's a change of behavior that requires some scrutiny. As part of #8085, the height will be passed into CConnman instead. For reference, it will end up looking more like this: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8085/commits/148163c9b1ce04ec9fa9c8ff9a4289520bd92127.\n\nEven without that, though, I think this is an improvement, as it eliminates a dependency on main from net.\n\nPush block height changes from main into net, and pass the current height into CNode at creation time, rather than pulling from main each time (and locking cs_main). Now CNode has no dependency on main for height.\n\nNote that It may also be handy to know later what our original height was for a given node.\n\nThis also helps to prevent identity leakage a tiny bit. Before this change, an\nattacker could theoretically make 2 connections on different interfaces. They\nwould connect fully on one, and only establish the initial connection on the\nother. Once they receive a new block, they would relay it to your first\nconnection, and immediately commence the version handshake on the second. Since\nthe new block height was reflected immediately, they could attempt to learn\nwhether the two connections were correlated.\n\nThis is, of course, incredibly unlikely to work due to the small timings\ninvolved and receipt from other senders. But it doesn't hurt to lock-in\nnBestHeight at the time of connection, rather than letting the remote choose\nthe time.\n",

Before this change, an\nattacker could theoretically make 2 connections on different interfaces. They\nwould connect fully on one, and only establish the initial connection on the\nother. Once they receive a new block, they would relay it to your first\nconnection, and immediately commence the version handshake on the second. Since\nthe new block height is reflected immediately, they could attempt to learn\nwhether the two connections were correlated.\n\nThis is, of course, incredibly unlikely to work due to the small timings\ninvolved and receipt from other senders. But it doesn't hurt to lock-in\nnBestHeight at the time of connection, rather than letting the remote choose\nthe time.",

Otherwise it will be difficult to understand these changes when searching in history later.\r\n\r\nThe original PR description follows.\r\n---\r\nThis work creates CConnman. The idea is to begin moving data structures and functionality out of globals in net.h and into an instanced class, in order to avoid side-effects in networking code. Eventually, an (internal) api begins to emerge, and as long as the conditions of that api are met, the inner-workings may be a black box.\r\n\r\nFor now (for ease), a single global CConnman is created. Down the road, the instance could be passed around instead. Also, CConnman should be moved out of net.h/net.cpp, but that can be done in a separate move-only-ish step.\r\n\r\nA few todos remain here:\r\n\r\n* ~~there are `if(g_connman)`'s everywhere. A few places should assume that a connman is running (or it should be passed around). For example, ProcessMessages.~~\r\n* ~~GetRelayTx/RelayTransaction are awkward. Where should mapRelay live? Should it be dealt with directly rather than hidden inside of relay functions? (rebased on top of bitcoin/bitcoin#8082)~~\r\n* ~~How to deal with CConnman parameters? Continue adding them to Start(), or have it parse the program options itself? (Created CConnman::Options)~~\r\n* ~~RPC needs a new error for dealing with the \"p2p not enabled\" case.~~\r\n\r\nTodos for a follow-up PR:\r\n\r\n* Actually create connman.h/cpp and move the class there.\r\n* Pass CConnman into QT similar to the wallet\r\n* ~~Drop StartNode/StopNode and just use CConnman::Stop/Start directly (Need to make sure that MapPort can be moved directly into Init without side-effects)~~\r\n* Pass CChainParams into CConnman and pass it around\r\n* ~~Create CConnmanOptions to reduce the verbosity of CConnman::Start()~~\r\n* Deal with fDiscover/fListen/etc in CConnman\r\n",

Ensuring modification order for nBestHeight matches the order established by cs_main would be sufficient to maintain the current behaviour.\n\nIt does seem like it would be better to have a high-water-mark variable protected by cs_main that main code could use to signal when a new _best_ height was reached. I don't see the need for that change necessarily to be included in this PR though.\n",
