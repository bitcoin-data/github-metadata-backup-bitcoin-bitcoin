    "body": "This PR modifies `DataStream`'s byte-vector `vch` to use the default allocator `std::allocator` rather than the `zero_after_free_allocator` which degrades performance greatly. The `zero_after_free_allocator` is identical to the default `std::allocator` except that it zeroes memory using `memory_cleanse()` before deallocating.\r\n\r\nThis PR also drops the `zero_after_free_allocator`, since this was only used by `DataStream` and `SerializeData`. \r\n\r\nIn my testing (n=2) on a Raspberry Pi 5 with 4GB of memory, syncing from a fast connection to a stable dedicated node, my branch takes **~74%** of the time taken by master[^1] to sync to height 815,000; average wall clock time was 35h 58m 40s on this branch and 48h 17m 15s on master. (See the benchmarking [appendix](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30987#issuecomment-2379480304))\r\n\r\nI expect most of the performance improvement to come from the use of `DataStream` for all `CDBWrapper` keys and values, and for all P2P messages. I suspect there are other use cases where performance is improved, but I have only tested IBD.\r\n\r\nAny objects that contains secrets should *not* be allocated using `zero_after_free_allocator` since they are liable to get mapped to swap space and written to disk if the user is running low on memory, and I intuit this is a likelier path than scanning unzero'd memory for an attacker to find cryptographic secrets. Secrets should be allocated using `secure_allocator` which cleanses on deallocation and `mlock()`s the memory reserved for secrets to prevent it from being mapped to swap space.\r\n\r\n## Are any secrets stored in `DataStream` that will lose security?\r\n\r\nI have reviewed every appearance of `DataStream` and `SerializeData` as of [`39219fe`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/39219fe145e5e6e6f079b591e3f4b5fea8e718040) and have made notes in the [appendix](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30987#issuecomment-2379480304) below with notes that provide context for each instance where either is used.\r\n\r\nThe only use case that I wasn't certain of is PSBT's, I believe these are never secrets, but I am not certain if there are use cases where PSBT's are worthy of being treated as secrets, and being vigilant about not writing them to disk is wise.\r\n\r\nAs I understand, most of the use of `DataStream` in the wallet code is for the reading and writing of \"crypted\" key and value data, and they get decrypted somewhere else in a `ScriptPubKeyMan` far away from any `DataStream` container, but I could also be wrong about this, or have misunderstood its use elsewhere in the wallet.\r\n\r\n## Zero-after-free as a buffer overflow mitigation\r\n\r\nThe `zero_after_free` allocator was added as a buffer overflow mitigation, the idea being that `DataStream`'s store a lot of unsecured data that we don't control like the UTXO set and all P2P messages, and an attacker could fill memory in a predictable way to escalate a buffer overflow into an RCE. (See Historical Background [appendix](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30987#issuecomment-2379480304)).\r\n\r\nI agree completely with practicing security in depth, but I don't think this mitigation is worth the performance hit because: \r\n\r\n1. Aren't there still an abundance of other opportunities for an attacker to fill memory that never gets deallocated?\r\n2. Doesn't ASLR mostly mitigate this issue and don't most devices have some form of ASLR?\r\n\r\nI'm not a security expert and I had a hard time finding any writing anywhere that discusses this particular mitigation strategy of zeroing memory, so I hope someone with more knowledge of memory vulnerabilities can assist.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n#### Other notes\r\n\r\n- I opted to leave `SerializeData` as `std::vector<std::byte>` instead of deleting it and refactoring in the spots where it's used in the wallet to keep the PR small, if others think it would be better to delete it I would be happy to do it.\r\n- I have a feeling that it's not just that we're memsetting everything to 0 in `memory_cleanse` that is causing the performance issue, but the trick we do to prevent compilers from optimizing out the `memset` call is also preventing other optimizations on the `DataStream`'s, but I have yet to test this.\r\n-  I also make a small change to a unit test where boost mysteriously fails to find a left shift-operator for `SerializeData` once it loses its custom allocator.\r\n\r\n[^1]: Master at the time of my testing was: [`6d546336e800`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/6d546336e800)\r\n",

Security in depth is important.\r\n>\r\n> Here's the danger:\r\n>\r\n> Attacker finds a remotely-exploitable buffer overrun somewhere in the networking code that crashes the process.\r\n> They turn the crash into a full remote exploit by sending carefully constructed packets before the crash packet, to initialize used-but-then-freed memory to a known state.\r\n>\r\n> Unlikely? Sure.\r\n>\r\n> Is it ugly to define a zero_after_free_allocator for CDataStream? Sure. (simplest implementation: copy secure_allocator, remove the mlock/munlock calls).\r\n>\r\n> But given that CDataStream is the primary interface between bitcoin and the network, I think being extra paranoid here is a very good idea.\r\n\r\nAnother reviewer [benchmarked](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/740#issuecomment-3356541) `CDataStream` with an allocator that zeroed memory using `memset` without `mlock`ing it and found that performance was almost identical to the default allocator, while both were substantially faster than the `mlock`ing variant of `CDataStream`. (https://web.archive.org/web/20130622160044/https://people.xiph.org/~greg/bitcoin-sync.png).\r\n\r\nBased on the benchmark, and the potential security benefit, the `zero_after_free` allocator was created and used as `CDataStream`'s allocator.\r\n\r\nIn November 2012, PR [#1992](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1992) was opened to address the fact that in many cases `memset()` calls are optimized away by compilers as part of a family of compiler optimizations called [dead store elimination](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity17/technical-sessions/presentation/yang) by replacing the `memset` call with openssl's `OPENSSL_cleanse` which is meant to solve this problem by doing things that spook compilers into not wanting to optimize the `memset`. Given that all of the data being zero'ed out in the deallocator is also having it's only pointer destroyed, these memset calls were candidates for being optimized.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the reason no performance regression was found in the benchmarking of [#740](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/740) which introduced the `zero_after_free` allocator is that the `memset` calls were being optimized out.\r\n\r\nI am not the first to suggest that this is a performance issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2015-11-06#1446837840-1446854100;\r\n\r\nhttps://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2016-11-23#1479883620-1479882900;\r\n\r\nOr to write a patch changing it:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/671c724716abdd69b9d253a01f8fec67a37ab7d7\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\n\r\n### All uses of DataStream and SerializeData\r\n( ⚠️ when opening: very long)\r\n\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\nI performed this review on commit [39219fe145e5e6e6f079b591e3f4b5fea8e71804](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/39219fe145e5e6e6f079b591e3f4b5fea8e71804)\r\n\r\nI look, briefly, at every single use of `DataStream` outside of test code, to see whether or not it contains secret information that should be zeroed out, or should be mlocked to prevent paging to swap.\r\n\r\nI've taken liberties to editorialize some of the codeblocks below for legibility, and all comments that have `[]` are my own.\r\n\r\n##### `DataStream`\r\n\r\nIn `src/addrdb.cpp`+`src/addrdb.h`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n/** Only used by tests. */\r\nvoid ReadFromStream(AddrMan& addr, DataStream& ssPeers);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly used by tests.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn `src/addrman.cpp` `Addrman::Serialize(DataStream&)` & `Unserialize(DataStream&)`, are explicitly instantiated, these are used in `SerializeFileDB` and `DeserializeDB` which are used to serialize (`DumpPeerAddresses`) addrman to disk, and to deserialize addrman from disk (`LoadAddrman`).\r\n\r\nThe most valuable secret seems to be addrman's `nKey` used to determine the address buckets randomly.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIn `src/blockencodings.cpp`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid CBlockHeaderAndShortTxIDs::FillShortTxIDSelector() const {\r\n    DataStream stream{};\r\n    stream << header << nonce;\r\n    CSHA256 hasher;\r\n    hasher.Write((unsigned char*)&(*stream.begin()), stream.end() - stream.begin());\r\n    uint256 shorttxidhash;\r\n    hasher.Finalize(shorttxidhash.begin());\r\n    shorttxidk0 = shorttxidhash.GetUint64(0);\r\n    shorttxidk1 = shorttxidhash.GetUint64(1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we are just using the DataStream to be able to Serialize the block header and nonce into a string of bytes that get hashed to make short id k0 and k1 for [BIP 152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki#short-transaction-ids).\r\n\r\nThis gets invoked when we construct a `CBlockHeaderandShortTxIDs` for an INV of type `MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK` in `PeerManagerImpl::SendMessage()`.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIn `src/common/blooms.cpp`:\r\n\r\nDataStream is used to deserialize outpoints into our bloom filter, these are not secrets in any way:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid CBloomFilter::insert(const COutPoint& outpoint)\r\n{\r\n    DataStream stream{};\r\n    stream << outpoint;\r\n    insert(MakeUCharSpan(stream));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIn `src/core_read.cpp`:\r\n\r\nDataStream is used in `DecodeTx` for serialization/deserialization of the transaction data, used afaict only in RPC's for deserializing user arguments into `CMutableTransaction`'s.\r\n\r\nIt's used in `DecodeHexBlockHeader()`which deserializes a block header argument into a `CBlockHeader` for the `submitheader` rpc.\r\n\r\nSimilar for `DecodeHexBlk()` used by the `getblocktemplate` and `submitblock` rpc's.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn `src/core_write.cpp`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid CBloomFilter::insert(const COutPoint& outpoint)\r\n{\r\n    DataStream stream{};\r\n    stream << outpoint;\r\n    insert(MakeUCharSpan(stream));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`EncodeHexTx` is only used in RPC's, and transaction data does not contain secrets.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nIn `dbwrapper.h` and `dbwrapper.cpp` it is used exclusively to serialize and deserialize coinsdb keys and values, none of which is secret.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIn `src/external_signer`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nbool ExternalSigner::SignTransaction(PartiallySignedTransaction& psbtx, std::string& error)\r\n{\r\n    // Serialize the PSBT\r\n    DataStream ssTx{};\r\n    ssTx << psbtx;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a secret, but I don't know enough about PSBT's to be sure.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThere is some scaffolding for being able to transmit serializable stuff over the IPC wire in `src/capnp/common-types.h`, I assume this depends on how it's used, nothing essentially secret.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIn `src/kernel/coinstats.cpp`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid ApplyCoinHash(MuHash3072& muhash, const COutPoint& outpoint, const Coin& coin)\r\n{\r\n    DataStream ss{};\r\n    TxOutSer(ss, outpoint, coin);\r\n    muhash.Insert(MakeUCharSpan(ss));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere it's used for serializing oupoints and coins for creating the AssumeUTXO assumed utxo set hash, nothing secret.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIn `src/net.cpp`:\r\n\r\nIn `ConvertSeeds()` serialized seeds get converted into usable address objects, we initialize a DataStream with the input seeds that we are going to try connecting to during node bootstrapping.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n//! Convert the serialized seeds into usable address objects.\r\nstatic std::vector<CAddress> ConvertSeeds(const std::vector<uint8_t> &vSeedsIn)\r\n{\r\n    // It'll only connect to one or two seed nodes because once it connects,\r\n    // it'll get a pile of addresses with newer timestamps.\r\n    // Seed nodes are given a random 'last seen time' of between one and two\r\n    // weeks ago.\r\n    const auto one_week{7 * 24h};\r\n    std::vector<CAddress> vSeedsOut;\r\n    FastRandomContext rng;\r\n    ParamsStream s{DataStream{vSeedsIn}, CAddress::V2_NETWORK};\r\n    while (!s.eof()) {\r\n        CService endpoint;\r\n        s >> endpoint;\r\n        CAddress addr{endpoint, SeedsServiceFlags()};\r\n        addr.nTime = rng.rand_uniform_delay(Now<NodeSeconds>() - one_week, -one_week);\r\n        LogDebug(BCLog::NET, \"Added hardcoded seed: %s\\n\", addr.ToStringAddrPort());\r\n        vSeedsOut.push_back(addr);\r\n    }\r\n    return vSeedsOut;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also used for creating an empty `CNetMessage` which has a `DataStream` member in `CNetMessage V2Transport::GetReceivedMessage()`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n//!

(PR [#635](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/635)\r\n\r\nBut at this point, the wallet has already been encrypted, and we won't be loading anything from slack space when rewriting the db, so no problems.\r\n\r\n`BerkeleyCursor::Next()` is used when cursoring through the BDB, and stores the retrieved Key and Value in DataStream's, if the wallet is encrypted these will be crypted, if not, the keys are on disk in plaintext anyways.\r\n\r\n`BerkeleyBatch::ReadKey()` retrieves the value for a given key in the database:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nbool BerkeleyBatch::ReadKey(DataStream&& key, DataStream& value)\r\n{\r\n    if (!pdb)\r\n        return false;\r\n\r\n    SafeDbt datKey(key.data(), key.size());\r\n\r\n    SafeDbt datValue;\r\n    int ret = pdb->get(activeTxn, datKey, datValue, 0);\r\n    if (ret == 0 && datValue.get_data() != nullptr) {\r\n        value.clear();\r\n        value.write(SpanFromDbt(datValue));\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not a concern because like above, this data is either in plaintext on disk, or it is being retrieved in crypted form and will be decrypted elsewhere by SPKM.\r\n\r\nSimilar arguments to the above apply for `BerkeleyBatch::WriteKey()`, `BerkeleyBatch::EraseKey()`, and `BerkeleyBatch::HasKey()`\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIn `src/wallet/db.h`:\r\n\r\nThe same argument as above applies for keys and

I suspect that the biggest improvements will be seen on memory bandwidth constrained systems and when flushing/syncing coinsdb to disk, which you have skipped most of by running such a high dbcache and unpruned, so I think that your setup is worst case scenario for improvements seen from this change but this could be my own wishful thinking! \r\n\r\n> I suspect the speedup here is going to be very dependent on the architecture/environment, but it's not clear to me exactly what variables would matter most.\r\n> \r\n> Would you be interested in working up a specific zero-after-free benchmark that illustrates the difference? If we knew exactly where the speedup was coming from, we could make a more informed decision about what/where to optimize.\r\n\r\n@theuni Good point, especially given Sjors result, I will draft up a zero-after-free benchmark to isolate the causes / relevant factors of any performance benefit that might be here. I think a `CDBWrapper::BatchWrite()` benchmark could also be helpful for this and other PR's like #30039 that claim to improve IBD write performance.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Fixed the spurious array bounds warning that occurs on Debian because it uses GCC 12.2, which has a bug where some uses of `std::vector::insert()` result in an incorrect array bounds warning, this issue was previously discussed in #30765. (See: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/c78d8ff4cb83506413bb73833fc5c04885d0ece8)\r\n\r\nAs suggested by @theuni, I've added some benchmarks that help show where the performance improvement is coming from. In a test where a 1000-byte `CScript`  is serialized into a `DataStream`, a Ryzen 7900x machine (5200 MT/s DDR5) serializes ~23.33GB/s on my branch and ~4.58 GB/s on master, and a Raspberry Pi 5 4GB serializes ~7.03GB/s on my branch and ~5.42GB/s on master.\r\n\r\nI also made a branch(https://github.com/davidgumberg/bitcoin/commit/c832feda63c586094193433a336b930147472285) with a version of the zero after free allocator that keeps the compiler optimization prevention, but doesn't actually memset the stream to zero, and performance in some cases is only slightly better than master. For example, in the same test as above, it managed ~4.72 GB/s on the 7900x, on the Raspberry Pi performance of this \"partial zero-after-free\" branch was closer to my no-zeroing branch, getting ~6.95GB/s. This seems to hint that a large part of the performance issue here isn't just from zeroing memory with `memset()`: it's other compiler optimizations prevented by [what we do](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/489e5aa3a2999cb18e018c40414a27667891b1c2/src/support/cleanse.cpp#L33) to prevent `memset()` from being optimized out.\r\n\r\nI ran the benchmarks on three devices, and the data is below, the most curious result is from the Ryzen 7640U w/ 5600 MT/s memory, which showed the least improvement between the master, \"partial zero\", and my branch. Repeated runs were noisy, I used `pyperf system tune` to try to stabilize these results, but I think there is inherent thermal instability in that device's laptop form factor. Worth pointing out is that the 7640U has worse compute performance than the 7900x but the 7640U has faster memory. [^1] So this may just be a consequence of the 7640U being the least memory-bandwidth-constrained of the three devices.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\n\r\n## Benchmark

memory performance, but I suspect the Ryzen 7640U device's memory is faster for reasons beyond the \"max bandwidth\". (5200 MT/s for 7900x, 5600 MT/s for the 7640U) I don't have a reference for this but I believe that the 7640U has a one generation newer memory controller than the Ryzen 7900x, and anecdotally I see better performance doing LLM inference on the CPU of the 7640U,  which is a memory bandwidth bound workload.",

Sadly, it suggests that there's really nothing that we can do to optimize our implementation. I looked around at clang/gcc/glibc/llvm-libc to see if there are any other ways of handling this, but they all resort to the same memory barrier trick.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely interesting enough to consider disabling selectively, though I'm not convinced we should just nuke it everywhere.\r\n\r\nI know you've already collected a good bit of data on this, but it's still not clear to me _exactly_ why this is speeding up IBD. It could be, for example, that the net messages account for 90% of the memory_cleanse() calls.\r\n\r\nWould you be up for creating a callgraph/flamegraph which shows the hierarchy for these calls? ",

      "body": "Concept ACK. Using zero-after-free allocators for all CDataStream usage is overkill. i don't think there are any, but if there are places where it is used (wallet)  where security against key leaks is important, we could parametrize `CDataStream<AllocatorType>` and pass a `secure_allocator`. Agree that zeroing adding extra security against buffer overflows is a red herring.\r\n\r\ni expect this can make a significant differences on systems with relatively slow CPU or memory, like ARM systems (will run some benchmarks).\r\n\r\n> Any objects that contains secrets should not be allocated using zero_after_free_allocator since they are liable to get mapped to swap space and written to disk if the user is running low on memory\r\n\r\nExactly. We have `secure_allocator` that creates a pool of non-paged memory, as well as zeros on deallocation, `zero_after_free_allocator`s insufficient for this purpose. This is very inefficient, though, so should be used with care.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Benchmarked on a Rpi5 with NVME hat, synchronizing from a node directly connected over a 1Gbit network ,\r\ncompiler: `gcc (Debian 12.2.0-14) 12.2.0`\r\nbitcoin running with default dbcache setting (450), `-connect=192.168.1.x:8333 -nolisten -stopatheight=800000`\r\n```\r\n0c2c3bb3f5c6f52c8db625c3edb51409c72c14b0  Base\r\n\r\n    2024-10-16T08:14:13Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f height=0 version=0x00000001 log2_work=32.000022 tx=1 date='2009-01-03T18:15:05Z' progress=0.000000 cache=0.3MiB(0txo)\r\n    2024-10-16T18:56:56Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000002a7c4c1e48d76c5a37902165a270156b7a8d72728a054 height=800000 version=0x341d6000 log2_work=94.318003 tx=868965226 date='2023-07-24T03:17:09Z' progress=0.792864 cache=508.9MiB(3772216txo)\r\n\r\n    >>> (datetime.datetime.fromisoformat('2024-10-16T18:56:56') - datetime.datetime.fromisoformat('2024-10-16T08:14:13')).seconds\r\n    38563\r\n\r\n906e67b95157fd557438c37b3085cf5dec2ae135  This PR\r\n\r\n    2024-10-15T10:39:43Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f height=0 version=0x00000001 log2_work=32.000022 tx=1 date='2009-01-03T18:15:05Z' progress=0.000000 cache=0.3MiB(0txo)\r\n    2024-10-15T21:16:02Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000002a7c4c1e48d76c5a37902165a270156b7a8d72728a054 height=800000 version=0x341d6000 log2_work=94.318003 tx=868965226 date='2023-07-24T03:17:09Z' progress=0.793244 cache=508.9MiB(3772216txo)\r\n```\r\n```python\r\n>>> (datetime.datetime.fromisoformat('2024-10-16T18:56:56') - datetime.datetime.fromisoformat('2024-10-16T08:14:13')).seconds\r\n38563\r\n>>> (datetime.datetime.fromisoformat('2024-10-15T21:16:02') - datetime.datetime.fromisoformat('2024-10-15T10:39:43')).seconds\r\n38179\r\n```\r\nIt is faster but only by roughly 1%.",
