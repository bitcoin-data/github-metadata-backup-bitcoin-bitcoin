About usage of Tor and Tor bridges, suggestions to consider tradeoffs based on user environment.\r\n2. Mention about Deleting \"onion_v3_private_key\" frequently doesn't help and for some users its better to not use Bitcoin Core Onion Service.\r\n3. Trade-offs involved in using `onlynet=onion`\r\n4. Downloading packages using `torsocks`\r\nContext: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20757#discussion_r563814109\r\n\r\nReasons:\r\n\r\n1. Point mentioned about DNS requests is important. I am not sure if we can include more details in this doc but it should be highlighted. I had asked one related question recently on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l641hj/dns_requests_in_bitcoin_core/\r\n2. Usage of Tor and Tor bridges is not same in all places. Users should be aware of such things.\r\n3. Adding an example makes it easier for normal users to refer this doc when they try Bitcoin Core Onion Service first instead of reading several other articles, thread, questions etc. on different websites. Recently someone tweeted a thread about installing Bitcoin Core: https://twitter.com/Ethan_Heilman/status/1355645616056098817\r\n\r\nFixes #19923\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> Is it useful to tell people to install nyx if they wish to monitor Tor?\r\n\r\nYes. Looks interesting. Never used it before but tried today and best thing I like about is the description in FAQ:\r\n\r\n_Simple - because the Greek goddess of night is short and memorable. Terminal applications are handiest when they're brief and easy to type. Top, ssh, scp - anything longer is just begging to be aliased down._\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/111895694-51338800-8a3a-11eb-9062-28a3d1c6de6d.png)\r\n\r\nMaybe we can have a mini nyx for `bitcoind` or new RPC. Although a new follow up PR would be better to increase the probability of getting things merged soon and make it easier for people to review.\r\n\r\n> If we become Tor central is that bad?\r\n\r\nCan you explain this in detail?",

But I'm not really in favor of mentioning them in the repository, I haven't vetted this software, and don't want to maintain a list of them, it's typically more of a wiki thing.",

          "title": "Road to Tor v3 support (BIP155)",
          "body": "Conjunction of a large number of back ports, updates and refactorings that made with the final goal of implementing v3 Onion addresses support (BIP155 https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki) before the tor v2 addresses EOL, scheduled, by the Tor project, for (1) July 15th: v2 addr support removal from the code base, and (2) October 15th: v2 addr network disable, where **every peer in our network running under Tor will loose the connection and drop the network**.\r\n\r\nAs BIP155 describes, this is introducing a new P2P message to gossip longer node addresses over the P2P network. This is required to support new-generation Onion addresses, I2P, and potentially other networks that have longer endpoint addresses than fit in the 128 bits of the current addr message.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the end goal, had to:\r\n1.  Create Span class and push it up to latest Bitcoin implementation. \r\n2.  Update the whole serialization framework and every object using it up to latest Bitcoin implementation (3-4 years ahead of what we currently are in master).\r\n3.  Update the address manager implementing ASN-based bucketing of the network nodes.\r\n4.  Update and refactor the netAddress and address manager tests to latest Bitcoin implementation (4 years ahead of what we currently are in master).\r\n5.  Several util string, vector, encodings, parsing, hashing backports and more..\r\n\r\nImportant note: \r\nThis PR it is not meant to be merged as a standalone PR, will decouple smaller ones moving on. Adding on each sub-PR its own description isolated from this big monster.\r\n\r\nSecond note:\r\nThis is still a **work-in-progress**, not ready for testing yet. I'm probably missing to mention few PRs that have already adapted to our sources. Just making it public so can decouple the changes, we can start merging them and i can continue working a bit more confortable (rebase a +170 commits separate branch is not fun..).\r\n\r\n### List of back ported and adapted PRs:\r\n\r\nSpan and Serialization:\r\n----------------\r\n*  #12886.\r\n*  #12916.\r\n*  #13558.\r\n*  #13697.

Users should not search for proper documentation in different websites, forums, blogs etc. and everyone should be able to follow the things easily using **doc in this repository**. **Privacy** should not be hard to achieve or at least the first steps should be easy and encouraging enough to motivate the user in learning more later.\r\n3. The examples will help in **skipping all the things** mentioned in doc. Run the commands and setup Bitcoin Core Onion Service in **few minutes**. Once the user can see that onion address and things working it will motivate him to read all the things mentioned in doc if interested to research more.\r\n4. [Tor usage in Bitcoin Core](https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/?days=730) is 20-30%, I am sure everyone contributing in this repository wants to see this **number go up**. I personally want this to be above 50%. Using Bitcoin Core with Tor should be the default.\r\n\r\n_How?_\r\n\r\n1. I tried [adding 1 example for Ubuntu](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21157) to start with, however it looked like duplication of few things that were already mentioned in doc. So had to give up and look for other ways to add examples. ❌\r\n2. I would prefer adding screenshots with the basic steps. I don't think people will agree to add screenshots in [doc/tor.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md) so the options are:\r\n\r\n   2.1 Create a separate file for examples\r\n   2.2 Enable wikis for the repository and create a page\r\n   2.3 <mark>Add all examples in one Q&A on Bitcoin Stackexchange and use its link 🤔\r\n   2.4 None of the above\r\n3. How would the examples look like? [Basic steps](https://twitter.com/prayankgahlot/status/1407349275940605952) for [Operating Systems](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide) that are used more for desktop and mobile(Android).\r\n\r\nCc: @Rspigler\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "I would also refactor this whole section:\r\n- Current bullet formatting looks akward\r\n- Change the title so that a common naming format can be used if we want to add a guide for another system\r\n  - From: `Example: creating an onion service on Debian/Ubuntu Systems`\r\n  - To: `Setup Guide: Debian/Ubuntu`\r\n- Better explanations per each step \r\n\r\nHere is how that would look. This is just a rough suggestion, so make contextual additions as you see fit:\r\n\r\n## Setup Guide: Debian/Ubuntu\r\n\r\nAssuming you already have an installation of Bitcoin Core:\r\n\r\n##### 1. Install Tor:\r\n\r\nTo install Tor, run:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nsudo apt install tor\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 2. Edit Tor configuration file:\r\n\r\nopen up the `torrc` file with your favorite text editor, this example uses the `nano` text editor:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nsudo nano /etc/tor/torrc\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit the `torrc` file so that it has these settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nControlPort 9051\r\nCookieAuthentication 1\r\nCookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 3. Add user to Tor group:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nsudo usermod -a -G debian-tor satoshi\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 4. Restart Tor\r\n\r\nTo restart Tor, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo systemctl restart tor\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 5. Edit Bitcoin configuration file\r\n\r\nOpen up the `bitcoin.conf` file with your favorite text editor.\r\nEdit the file so that it contains these settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlisten=1\r\ntorcontrol=127.0.0.1:9051\r\ndebug=tor\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 6. Confirmation\r\nYou should be all set up to run a node through the Tor Network.\r\nYou can confirm that everything is setup correctly by running the `getnetworkinfo` \r\nRPC command. The result should look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocaladdresses\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"address\": \"omy7kj7zwvfg5luayideh73uqb2latkoyyy5h65y4atv3fymnlxlzwqd.onion\",\r\n    \"port\": 8333,\r\n    \"score\": 4\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "Here is how I would re-word this section. I feel that this encapsulates what you want to get across:\r\n\r\n#### Trade-offs of the `onlynet=onion` configuration option:\r\n\r\nThe privacy benefits of Tor are affected if a Tor-Bitcoin service node is reachable by IPv4/IPv6 nodes. Placing `onlynet=onion` in your bitcoin.conf file will ensure that your node only attempts to connect over the Tor network, thus maximizing the benefits of using Tor. The decision to use this option should consider the following trade-offs:\r\n\r\n**Sybil Attacks**\r\nWhile Sybil attacks are a threat on clearnet networks, it is of greater concern on the Tor network. A node that only maintains connections over Tor is vulnerable to a Sybil attack because of the minimal cost of creating a Tor address. This minimal cost means that an attacker can flood the network with thousands of apparent Tor-Bitcoin nodes controlled by the attacker.\r\n\r\nOne way to mitigate this is by leaving out the `onlynet=onion` configuration option, which will allow connections to IPv4/IPv6 nodes. Clearnet IPs have a greater creation cost, making it harder for an attacker to carry out a successful Sybil attack. \r\n\r\n**Network Partitioning**\r\nIf every Tor-Bitcoin node ran using the `onlynet=onion` configuration option, no Tor node would communicate with the clearnet network. This would result in the Bitcoin network becoming partitioned. For the health of the Bitcoin network as a whole, some nodes must communicate among both clearnet and Tor. You can help prevent this scenario by excluding the `onlynet=onion` configuration option. ",

Edit Tor configuration file:**\n+\n+open up the `torrc` file with your favorite text editor, this example uses the `nano` text editor:\n+\n+```\n+sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc\n+```\n+Ensure that `torrc` has these settings, and save:\n+\n+```\n+ControlPort 9051\n+CookieAuthentication 1\n+CookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1\n+```\n+\n+**3. Add user to Tor group (\"satoshi\" in this example):**\n+\n+```\n+sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor satoshi\n+```\n+\n+**4. Restart Tor**\n+\n+To restart Tor, run:\n+\n+```\n+sudo systemctl restart tor\n+```\n+\n+**5. Edit Bitcoin configuration file**\n+\n+Open up the bitcoin.conf file with your favorite text editor.\n+Edit the file so that it contains these settings:\n+\n+```\n+listen=1\n+torcontrol=127.0.0.1:9051\n+debug=tor\n+```\n+\n+**6. Confirmation**\n+\n+You should be all set up to run a node through the Tor Network.\n+You can confirm that everything is setup correctly by running the getnetworkinfo",

The example here is just the basic steps required to quickly setup Bitcoin Core Onion Service on Ubuntu without going in to details and skipping whole documentation or fix things in case confused after reading everything written above.\r\n\r\n_What?_\r\n\r\nThe goal here was to mention 3 examples: Ubuntu, Windows and Android similar to https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98913/how-to-run-bitcoin-core-as-onion-service-on-windows-ubuntu-and-android/\r\n\r\n_Why?_\r\n\r\n1. There can be few users who refer to this doc but find everything mentioned confusing and give up somewhere in between or miss some important steps.\r\n2. We should avoid users searching for proper documentation in different websites, forums, blogs etc. and everyone should be able to follow the things easily using doc in this repository. Privacy should not be hard to achieve or at least the first steps should be easy and encouraging enough to motivate the user in learning more later.\r\n\r\nSo, the example is basically to skip all the things mentioned above. Run the commands and setup Bitcoin Core Onion Service in few minutes. Once the user can see that onion address and things working it will motivate him to read all the things mentioned in doc if interested to research more.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How?_\r\n\r\nI have added only Ubuntu in this doc because I was expecting if I try to add everything in one PR it will never get merged. I think I was wrong and PR is anyways not merged and its been months. So, I can add more things or look for more ACKs in this to get merged and do follow up PRs later.\r\n\r\nI can remove Line 293 and 294 if required to make the example even shorter and just the basic things one needs to try Bitcoin Core onion service quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
