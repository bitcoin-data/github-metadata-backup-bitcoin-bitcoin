    "body": "Improves the descriptor cache by changing it from a `std::vector<unsigned char>` to a newly introduced `DescriptorCache` class. Instead of serializing pubkeys and whatever else we would want to cache in a way that may not be backwards compatible, we instead create a `DescriptorCache` object and populate it. This object contains only an xpub cache. Since the only `PubkeyProvider` that used the cache is the `BIP32PubkeyProvider` we just have it store the xpubs instead of the pubkeys. This allows us to have both the parent xpub and the child xpubs in the same container. The map is keyed by `KeyOriginInfo`.\r\n\r\nSine we are caching `CExtPubKey`s in `DescriptorCache`, `BIP32PubKeyProviders` can use the cached parent xpubs to derive the children if unhardened derivation is used in the last step. This also means that we can still derive the keys for a `BIP32PubkeyProvider` that has hardened derivation steps. When combined with descriptor wallets, this should allow us to be able to import a descriptor with an `xprv` and hardened steps and still be able to derive from it. In that sense, this is an alternative to #18163\r\n\r\nTo test that this works, the tests have been updated to do an additional `Expand` at the `i + 1` position. This expansion is not cached. We then do an `ExpandFromCache` at `i + 1` and use the cache that was produced by the expansion at `i`. This way, we won't have the child xpubs for `i + 1` but we will have the parent xpubs. So this checks whether the parent xpubs are being stored and can be used to derive the child keys. Descriptors that have a hardened last step are skipped for this part of the test because that will always require private keys.",

      "body": "I've reworked how the caching works to get rid of the `global_pos` and `internal_pos` stuff.\r\n\r\nInstead of having `ExpandHelper` go through the cache and find the pubkeys, we pass the cache into the `PubkeyProvider`s and let them do the cache lookups. Since really only `BIP32PubkeyProvider` uses the cache, we can get rid of the position stuff by having it store only xpubs in a map. So for all derived keys, we store their `KeyOriginInfo` and xpub so that later the `BIP32PubkeyProvider` can look them up. The last parent is still being stored so that additional derivation can occur.\r\n\r\nThis consolidates cache reads and writes and encapsulates them in the classes that actually use the cache.",

They could take single `read_write_cache` argument. You could then move the cache update code from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16528/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.cpp#diff-5462ceb8a760a507152ab8b76bd48774R1690-R1719 to `Expand()`. When no cache argument is provided, fall back to an internal cache.",

We always cache if there are xpubs. If the descriptor has just an xpub, e.g. `wpkh(xpub...)`, we actually would cache that xpub. If it were `wpkh(xpub.../0)`, we would cache the derived xpub.

I agree it's low, but it's not so low that it is negligible, and certainly not so low that one couldn't grind a descriptor to intentionally cause a collision.\r\n\r\nThis makes me wonder if using KeyOriginInfo as key is the right approach. In theory, it should be sufficient to just key by the index of the key expression in the descriptor, right?
