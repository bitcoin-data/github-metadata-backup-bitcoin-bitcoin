    "body": "Type punning in C++ is not like C. As per the C++ standard, one cannot use unions to convert the bit type. A discussion about this can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25664848/unions-and-type-punning). In C++, a union is supposed to only hold one type at a time. It's intended to be used only as `std::variant`. Switching types is undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nIn fact, C++20 has a special casting function, called [`bit_cast`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast) that solved this problem.\r\n\r\nWhy has it been working so far? Because some compilers tolerate using unions and switching types, like gcc. More information [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Type-punning).\r\n\r\nOne important thing to mention is that performance is generally not affected by that memcpy. Compilers are smart enough to convert that to a memory cast when possible. But we have to do it the right way, otherwise, it's jut undefined behavior that depends on the compiler.",

The C++ Core Guidelines – with editors Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter – [has this to say](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c183-dont-use-a-union-for-type-punning): \"It is undefined behavior to read a union member with a different type from the one with which it was written.\"\r\n\r\n2. The C++ Core Guidelines [has this to say](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c183-dont-use-a-union-for-type-punning): \"Unfortunately, unions are commonly used for type punning. We don’t consider “sometimes, it works as expected” a strong argument.\"\r\n\r\n3. Professor John Regehr [has this to say](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/959): \"Again, although we might expect that adding a function call would make the code harder to optimize, both compilers understand memcpy deeply enough that we get the desired object code […] In my opinion c5 is the easiest code to understand out of this little batch of functions because it doesn’t do the messy shifting and also it is totally, completely, obviously free of complications that might arise from the confusing rules for unions and strict aliasing. It became my preferred idiom for type punning a few years ago when I discovered that compilers could see through the memcpy and generate the right code.\"\r\n\r\n4.

      "body": "> @luke-jr That would indeed be preferable, but it seems that would effectively require implementing a IEEE 754 software encoder/decoder, which is nontrivial.\r\n\r\nThere's a famous library, called [softfloat](http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/SoftFloat.html). It does all that. But I think that's unnecessary. IEEE 754 is the same everywhere as repsentation. The differences between different CPUs come from certain operations, like rounding and division by epsilon (IIRC). You can see in softfloat different rounding modes and similar things.",

You can see them in all my github projects that I wrote myself. But this one here I discovered by coincidence and hence fixed 😉 \r\n\r\nAnd I almost never use gcc anymore 😄 \r\n\r\nBtw, if you're interested, there's an issue I opened in libbtc about undefined behavior like 2 years ago... it's still untouched and not merged.
