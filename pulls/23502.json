    "body": "The current taproot signing code will end up creating transactions which do not meet the feerate target. This is primarily seen when spending a taproot output with the script path. In this scenario, because the public key is known, the dummy signer would incorrectly choose to create a dummy signed transaction that used the key path spend when the actual transaction would use script path. This results in a transaction that has a significantly lower fee rate because script path spends are much larger than key path spends. This is fixed by choosing the witness with the largest stack size rather than the smallest when doing size estimation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this change can result in massively overestimating the transaction fees which is undesirable. More discussion is needed to find a good solution to avoiding that problem.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional issue in the PSBT workflow where the sighash type would be appended during finalizing, but not during size estimation. That results in a transaction that is slightly larger than estimated so there is a lower feerate. This is resolved by having the DUMMY_MAXIMUM_SIGNATURE_CREATOR include the sighash type so that when funding with a watchonly wallet, we will estimate enough fee for the largest possible signature (as we do for ECDSA with high R).\r\n\r\nTests are updated to catch these case. `wallet_taproot.py` will now use a set feerate and check if the result meets that feerate.",

          "title": "wallet, spkm: Move key management from DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to wallet level KeyManager",
          "body": "This PR changes DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to no longer handle relevant keys directly. Instead all keys for all DescriptorSPKMs will be handled by a new `KeyManager` class which exists within `CWallet` (a reference to it is passed to each DescriptorSPKM). This allows us to have a concept of a wallet HD key for descriptor wallets. This makes it easier to add new single key descriptors that use the same HD master key as the rest of the autogenerated descriptors (e.g. for taproot). Multisigs will also be easier as an xpub belonging to the wallet can be exported without needing to do weird things like descriptor introspection and guessing about which descriptor's key to use.\r\n\r\n`KeyManager` is a class which handles all of the keys for DescriptorSPKMs. It contains the maps that hold the keys, deals with writing those keys to disk, and handles their encryption. Encryption keys are still managed by `CWallet` but provided to `KeyManager` through the `WalletStorage` interface. Signing is still done through `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::SignTransaction` however this will fetch the keys from `KeyManager` rather than storing keys in the DescriptorSPKM to be used.\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards compatible. Although `KeyManager` writes and uses keys in new `keyman_key` and `keyman_ckey` records, it will still write keys for each descriptor in `walletdescriptorkey` and `walletdescriptorckey` records. This allows a descriptor wallet created using this change to be opened by 22.0 and 0.21. Additionally, wallets created with older software will automatically be upgraded to using the `KeyManager` at first loading. This is done in the background and does not require any user interaction (i.e. no passphrase required).",

It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

          "body": "`BaseSignatureChecker` has virtual functions which are overridden by its child classes. These virtual functions have a default implementation. However because of the default implementation, bugs can be introduced by failing to implement one of them (e.g. #21151). To avoid this, those functions are made into pure virtual functions so that child classes must implement those functions. There are a few places where a `BaseSignatureChecker` was being created; these instances have been replaced with the `DUMMY_CHECKER`.\r\n\r\n`GenericTransactionSignatureChecker` has two constructors, one which takes a `PrecomputedTransactionData` and one which does not. It can be difficult to understand which one to use, and whether a particular `GenericTransactionSignatureChecker` has a `PrecomputedTransactionData`. This has lead to some bugs as well (e.g. #22784). Looking through the codebase, the only place where `PrecomputedTransactionData` does not need to be provided is in the unit tests. As such, this PR changes `GenericTransactionSignatureChecker` to have only one constructor which requires `PrecomputedTransactionData` to be provided. This has a side effect of requiring the same for `MutableTransactionSignatureCreator`, which also had two constructors, and the one that did not require `PrecomputedTransactionData` was only used in tests.",

Semantically it is very similar to the existing `multi()` descriptor, but with the following changes:\r\n* The corresponding script is `<key1> OP_CHECKSIG <key2> OP_CHECKSIGADD <key3> OP_CHECKSIGADD ... <key_n> OP_CHECKSIGADD <k> OP_NUMEQUAL`, rather than the traditional `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`-based script, making it usable inside the `tr()` descriptor.\r\n* The keys can optionally be specified in x-only notation.\r\n* Both the number of keys and the threshold can be as high as 999; this is the limit due to the consensus stacksize=1000 limit\r\n\r\nI expect that this functionality will later be replaced with a miniscript-based implementation, but I don't think it's necessary to wait for that.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n* The wallet code will for not estimate witness size incorrectly for script path spends, which may result in a (dramatic) fee underpayment with large multi_a scripts.\r\n* The multi_a script construction is (slightly) suboptimal for n-of-n (where a `<key1> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY ... <key_n-1> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY <key_n> OP_CHECKSIG` would be better). Such a construction is not included here.",

The most recent consensus is that a [minimal approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25732) is best. \r\n\r\n",

This PR fixes this issue.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `wallet_taproot.py` is modified to test for this scenario by having another wallet in `do_test_psbt` which contains descriptors that only have the keys involved in the descriptor being tested. `wallet_taproot.py` was also modified to create new wallets for each test case rather than sharing wallets throughout as the sharing could result in the signing wallet having the keys in a different descriptor and accidentally result in failing to detect a test failure.\r\n\r\nThe changes to the test also revealed a similar issue with `rawtr()` descriptors, which has also been fixed by checking if a descriptor can produce a `SigningProvider` for the Taproot output pubkey.",

So instead assume the most expensive between all script paths and the key path will be used.\r\n\r\nThis is still not ideal, as there may be a huge gap between the size of a script path spend and a key path spend.

I compiled and ran this branch and it completely solved this issue described above (PSBT script paths with missing pubkey details);\r\n\r\nFurther details;\r\nI created a multisig address using deriveaddresses and funded it. Then I tried to create a PSBT to spend from the funded address. I was unable to create a PSBT that could be properly processed in 24.0.1. After creating the PSBT and using walletprocesspsbt in my wallet with private keys disabled, it created PSBTs missing the 'taproot_bip32_derivs' on all the multisig inputs, so my signing wallets couldn't sign the transaction. \r\nThis is kinda crazy since I was able to create a multisig address and fund it - but now I can't spend from it. \r\n\r\nThe code in this PR solved my issue completely. I compiled this branch and was able to easily create the PSBT with the proper input data, sign it and broadcast.

Would we be overestimating the target and dropping an excess to the fees?\r\n\r\nAll overages due to size estimation differences are dropped to fees. The output values are set based upon the estimated size and they cannot be changed after signing. Once signing is completed and the final transaction created, if it ends up being smaller than estimated, whatever could have been saved will not be saved.\r\n\r\n> Does that get recognized when we compare coin selection solutions?\r\n\r\nNo. Prior to actual signing, all sizes use the size estimator, which this PR changes to use the worst case scenario.",
