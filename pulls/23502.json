    "body": "The current taproot signing code will end up creating transactions which do not meet the feerate target. This is primarily seen when spending a taproot output with the script path. In this scenario, because the public key is known, the dummy signer would incorrectly choose to create a dummy signed transaction that used the key path spend when the actual transaction would use script path. This results in a transaction that has a significantly lower fee rate because script path spends are much larger than key path spends. This is fixed by choosing the witness with the largest stack size rather than the smallest when doing size estimation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this change can result in massively overestimating the transaction fees which is undesirable. More discussion is needed to find a good solution to avoiding that problem.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional issue in the PSBT workflow where the sighash type would be appended during finalizing, but not during size estimation. That results in a transaction that is slightly larger than estimated so there is a lower feerate. This is resolved by having the DUMMY_MAXIMUM_SIGNATURE_CREATOR include the sighash type so that when funding with a watchonly wallet, we will estimate enough fee for the largest possible signature (as we do for ECDSA with high R).\r\n\r\nTests are updated to catch these case. `wallet_taproot.py` will now use a set feerate and check if the result meets that feerate.",

Notably, right now a PSBT that has script paths will not fill in pubkey details for the scripts. However the changes in this PR should also fix that.\r\n\r\nThis is my first time commenting on a PR, so I apologize if I am breaking any protocol or etiquette here. I compiled and ran this branch and it completely solved this issue described above (PSBT script paths with missing pubkey details);\r\n\r\nFurther details;\r\nI created a multisig address using deriveaddresses and funded it. Then I tried to create a PSBT to spend from the funded address. I was unable to create a PSBT that could be properly processed in 24.0.1. After creating the PSBT and using walletprocesspsbt in my wallet with private keys disabled, it created PSBTs missing the 'taproot_bip32_derivs' on all the multisig inputs, so my signing wallets couldn't sign the transaction. \r\nThis is kinda crazy since I was able to create a multisig address and fund it - but now I can't spend from it. \r\n\r\nThe code in this PR solved my issue completely. I compiled this branch and was able to easily create the PSBT with the proper input data, sign it and broadcast.

(And as a user there's no bigger problem then when you can't spend from an address that you control the keys to)",

      "body": "> How would this behave in the context of changeless transactions? Would we be overestimating the target and dropping an excess to the fees?\r\n\r\nAll overages due to size estimation differences are dropped to fees. The output values are set based upon the estimated size and they cannot be changed after signing. Once signing is completed and the final transaction created, if it ends up being smaller than estimated, whatever could have been saved will not be saved.\r\n\r\n> Does that get recognized when we compare coin selection solutions?\r\n\r\nNo. Prior to actual signing, all sizes use the size estimator, which this PR changes to use the worst case scenario.",
