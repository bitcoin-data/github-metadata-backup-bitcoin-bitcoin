    "body": "Often when we're updating mempool entries we update entries that we ultimately end up removing the updated entries shortly thereafter. This patch makes it so that we filter for such entries a bit earlier in processing, which yields a mild improvement for these cases, and is negligible overhead otherwise.\r\n\r\nThere's potential for a better -- but more sophisticated -- algorithm that can be used taking advantage of epochs, but I figured it is better to do something that is simple and works first and upgrade it later as the other epoch mempool work proceeds as it makes the patches for the epoch algorithm simpler to understand, so you can consider this as preparatory work. It could either go in now if it is not controversial, or we could wait until the other patch is ready to go.",

I'm mostly just suggesting some docs if you retouch.\r\n\r\nI wonder if (in addition to this) it would be worth changing ATMP to take a `bool check_for_children` param where, if true, looks for descendants in mempool and includes them when applying ancestor/descendant limits. Technically, ATMP is currently not enforcing these rules properly for reorgs by assuming no children in the mempool. That way we can probably remove them in `UpdateMempoolForReorg()` before even calling `UpdateTransactionsFromBlock()`.",

It could either go in now if it is not controversial, or we could wait until the other patch is ready to go.\r\n\r\nI don't have an opinion on patch ordering but I would be glad if we can land the Epoch changes (#17628) at some point.

          "body": "Similarly to how #18698 added `ProcessNewBlock()` and `ProcessNewBlockHeaders()` methods to the `ChainstateManager` class, this PR adds a new `ProcessTransaction()` method. Code outside validation no longer calls `AcceptToMemoryPool()` directly, but calls through the higher-level `ProcessTransaction()` method. Advantages:\r\n\r\n- The interface is simplified. Calling code no longer needs to know about the active chainstate or mempool object, since `AcceptToMemoryPool()` can only ever be called for the active chainstate, and that chainstate knows which mempool it's using. We can also remove the `bypass_limits` argument, since that can only be used internally in validation.\r\n- responsibility for calling `CTxMemPool::check()` is removed from the callers, and run automatically by `ChainstateManager` every time `ProcessTransaction()` is called.",

      "body": "When I read the commit:\r\n> Often when we're updating mempool entries we update entries that we\r\nultimately end up removing the updated entries shortly thereafter. This\r\npatch makes it so that we filter for such entries a bit earlier in\r\nprocessing\r\n\r\nbased on the wording, I assumed that we were \"filtering\" these entries out _before_ adding them to the mempool. However, after reviewing the PR it seems that these entries are still added to the mempool, state is still calculated/updated and cached, it's just that we are now (pre-emptively) removing `descendants_to_remove` right away at the end of `UpdateTransactionsFromBlock`\r\n\r\nIs my understanding correct? If so, it makes me wonder where the performance improvement is coming from. To me it seems all the same work is done before/after this PR, just earlier.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRe: my [review comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21464/commits/92647669428bdaca44813b958e33513958644227#r749526368) 92647669428bdaca44813b958e33513958644227, `mempool_updatefromblock.py` (which I agree is a great benchmark test for this optimization) is running in the ~same time before/after this PR. So I am curious if we are actually seeing any speedup from this optimization",

          "body": "This PR is a reattempt of #19645, which has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nCurrently, an existing mempool transaction can't be replaced by a transaction that's identical except for its witness (same txid, different wtxid); the request is rejected as a duplicate. This PR changes this behavior such that the mempool will replace the existing transaction if the new transaction has a smaller witness by at least 5% (an anti-Dos measure). The replacement transaction can't increase the fee (since its inputs and outputs cannot change), but it necessarily has a higher fee _rate_ than the existing transaction, since its overall size is lower. Miners should always prefer the replacement transaction.\r\n\r\nAn important difference between what this PR implements and the existing RBF (replace-by-fee, BIP125) is that the replacement can occur even if the original transaction is not marked as replaceable. This is because the replacement transaction will pay the same outputs as the transaction being replaced (identical txids ensures this), so the recipients of the existing transaction have no reason to fear not being paid by the replacement transaction. Unlike RBF, all of the existing transaction's descendants, if any, remain in the mempool.\r\n\r\nInitially, we'll limit this to single transactions (not packages); this can be reconsidered later.",

Use std::vector<txiter> in cacheMap instead of std::set<txiter> which makes (iirc) entries go from > ~64 bytes to just 8 bytes\r\n2.  Don't look up in cacheMap the updateIt N times, look it up once and directly write the vector with known length (saves resizing)\r\n3. Use epochs to de-duplicate (saves N log N lookups)\r\n4. trimming from setExclude in a hotter loop\r\n\r\n",
