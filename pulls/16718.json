    "body": "**tl;dr**\r\n\r\nI try swapping out `std::unordered_map` for a faster third-party implementation where it matters, see something like 15% speedup for initial block download coincident with a 19.3% reduction in memory usage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen profiling initial block download, it's evident that a decent chunk of time on the critical path is spent in `CCoinsViewCache`, the data structure responsible for the in-memory representation of the UTXO set.\r\n\r\n![Selection_147](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/63644597-9b1b8700-c6ba-11e9-964c-91c6fb78b3a2.png)\r\n*Profile of the `msghand` thread at height ~300,000.*\r\n\r\nThe essential data member of the cache, `cacheCoins`, is a `std::unordered_map` that holds as many UTXO as can fit into memory given the `dbcache` setting. While this map implementation is definitely preferable to `std::map` (which retains order and has O(log(n)) lookups insted of O(1)), both stdlib maps are subpar [relative to non-`std` alternatives](https://martin.ankerl.com/2019/04/01/hashmap-benchmarks-01-overview/).\r\n\r\nAfter seeing cacheCoins as a bottleneck, I decided to try swapping one of these alternative implementations in to see if there is any benefit. It looks like there is.\r\n\r\n![ibd local range 500000 520000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/63644703-0a927600-c6bd-11e9-9e1d-2748b8fbdf8d.png)\r\n\r\nFor 20,000 blocks at a representative part of the chain, we see something like a 15% speedup with a 19.3% reduction in memory usage (dbcache was set to 3000).\r\n\r\nThe `CCoinsCaching` benchmark shows improvement but not as dramatically as IBD does:\r\n\r\n![microbenches](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/63644768-572a8100-c6be-11e9-922c-8360a9f9e3b4.png)\r\n\r\nObviously adding 2000 lines of new consensus-critical code isn't appealing, but if those numbers hold for the full IBD process I think there might be a compelling case to be made for the added code.\r\n\r\n### Implementations considered\r\n\r\nOf the few best-looking options, I picked the one with the most succinct implementation and fewest dependencies, [`robin_hood::unordered_node_map`](https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing) (it's just a header file). I also looked at Facebook's [`F14NodeMap`](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/container/F14.md) and Abseil's [`node_hash_map`](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/container) but both required too much elbow-grease (for now) to integrate here without pulling in a whole lot of code.\r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\n\r\nI'm going to be running more comprehensive benchmarks, including a near-full IBD from the network, to see if these improvements hold.\r\n\r\nI'm also interested in benching this along with a similar change to `mapBlockIndex` (currently a `std::unordered_map`).\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\nIf we decide to include this or another hashmap implementation, should we do a full fork inclusion a la leveldb or should we try to slim down the implementation to a single header file as is done here (but more)?",

      "body": "> Would love a quick explanation on how to run all these benchmarks myself (so I can get both a control before changing and after).\r\n\r\nYou can use [bitcoinperf](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/bitcoinperf) to perform the host-local comparative benchmarks I've posted above. I've committed an example file for this branch [here](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/bitcoinperf/blob/master/examples/robinhood-hashing.yml) - note that you're going to have to change some of the paths and potentially create some partially synced datadirs to be able to use it.\r\n\r\n> Why did you choose unordered_node_map and not unordered_flat_map?\r\n\r\nIn the case of `cacheCoins`, the values can be fairly large (>55 bytes) since they include scriptPubkeys. The flat map is good for values of small size, but shuffling around medium-to-large objects isn't the intended use. The node map allocates values separately and stores pointers instead. See [Folly's docs](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/container/F14.md#f14-variants) for more details.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm happy to benchmark against a `flat_map` implementation to see how it compares to `node_map`.\r\n\r\n> Do you think it would be interesting in the future for other uses of std::unordered_map in the code? (and potentially even std::map)\r\n\r\nYeah, I do, though I don't expect any other piece of data in the system will give us such dramatic improvements in performance. If we're going to use this map for arguably the most sensitive data structure in the system, we might as well use it elsewhere. I think a compelling candidate would be `mapBlockIndex`, but there are probably other good uses as well.",

As you probably know, we can't just evict stuff from cacheCoins - we have to be very careful about persisting cache content (`FlushStateToDisk()`) before eviction. At the moment it looks like CuckooCache quietly evicts data when it fills up - I'm curious to see how you'll ensure that we can coordinate eviction with a guaranteed flush.",

Please ask away if you have any question about my implementation! \r\n\r\nI have also done extensive map benchmarks here, which might be interesting: https://github.com/martinus/map_benchmark\r\n\r\nI agree with @JeremyRubin that the `throwOverflowError()` is a potential problem, if there is a way to force collisions in the map. Be aware that new hasmaps (facebook's F14, Google's Swisstable) also depend on good hashes. They don't throw an exception, but performance can degrade so much that it's not much different from an infinite loop.",

      "body": "@elichai, we have been using the map in several core components in [Dynatrace's](https://www.dynatrace.com) proprietary monitoring platform for quite a while. That's a very well tested and widely deployed product on multiple platforms (I work at dynatrace so I might be biased..).\r\n\r\nI don't know much about other use cases. Here is a github query tough to find other uses of the map: https://github.com/search?q=robin_hood_h_included&type=Code It only finds usages who copied the file though.\r\n\r\nSome usages that I had a look at: \r\n* https://github.com/jinja2cpp/Jinja2Cpp reported 2x speedup https://twitter.com/flex_ferrum/status/1159210516943908865\r\n* https://github.com/carlfindahl/wacman 2x speedup: https://github.com/carlfindahl/wacman/commit/2189bef22eb86d4ad227dcd3b7ed1ca412110d15#diff-275e07678407ddce12c68ed11772f041R90\r\n* https://github.com/masc-ucsc/lgraph serializes and mmaps robin_hood maps https://github.com/masc-ucsc/lgraph/commit/ec37bdc6e867824a40e269bd5204cd42b1a75cf3. I don't know of any speedups.\r\n* https://github.com/p-ranav/csv has switched from tessil's robin_hood map to my map and reported speedup here: https://github.com/p-ranav/csv/commit/eabe6172cad9bad1f35b0749d729cbb3df89c8c2\r\n* https://github.com/JeremyBYU/polylidarv2 has 30% speedup https://github.com/JeremyBYU/polylidarv2/commit/8e6e07bff1de5046cf60af6a62045abba7cf15ea",

      "body": "It would be very interesting where exactly the speedup is coming from. It might be possible to reproduce this speedup by staying with `std::unordered_map`. E.g. I see two possibilities for improvement:\r\n\r\n* robin_hood map requires less hashing and less key comparisons than std::unordered_map. It might be possible to save a lot of hashing & comparisons by simply adding the precalculated hash value to the key (so instead of the `COutPoint` use e.g. `std::pair<COutPoint, size_t>`. This unfortunately will increase memory usage a bit (but not much, since the key/value pair is already quite large).\r\n\r\n* I use a bulk allocator that never frees any memory, but reuses previously allocated memory. So once the cache has reached its peak size, no allocations will be necessary any more. This can also be achieved with a custom allocator for std::unordered_map.\r\n\r\n* If the speedup comes from the robin_hood style memory layout, that's bad luck - can't be achieved with `std::unordered_map`.",

The last thing I want is to be responsible for a consensus failure. \r\n\r\nI wonder if these performance gains indeed turn out to be real, we could devote a substantial amount of effort to scrutinizing this map implementation using e.g. fuzz + stress testing and thorough manual review. After some period (months), we could make its use opt-in via configure flag to allow some hardware-constrained installations to use it.\r\n\r\nThat said, in the grand scheme of things maybe even a 50% speedup in IBD is negligibly marginal relative to the risk.",

For accurate reproducability I have disabled frequency scaling and turbo boost for my cpu (with [sudo pyperf system tune](https://pyperf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). Runtime with `std::unordered_map` is 6471 seconds, and 5339 seconds with robin_hood map, 21% faster.\r\n\r\nI've modified `SaltedOutpointHasher` and added a custom equals function to count the number of hashes and equal operations performed. To my surprise, on my system `std::unordered_map` needs *less* hash calls. It looks like it caches the full hash. (10.7 vs. 13.2 billion hashes). I've benchmarked just the hashing and equals operations, and this should account for about 323 vs. 391 seconds of CPU total.\r\n\r\nNext I'm going to try to use a bulk pool allocator for std::unordered_map and see how that goes.\r\n",

Furthermore (this is a little bit platform dependent, but maybe we can detect it or wrap the hash in an is_integral type) we can set __cache_hash_code in the map to false, and save another 8 bytes. Depending on padding issues we may save even more space.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks for running those benchmarks, @martinus. I also think we should try calling `cacheCoins.reserve(dbcache / avg_coinscacheentry_size)` somewhere during startup with both implementations to see how that affects things.\r\n\r\nOn the chance that we still want to consider using the `robin_hood` map, I've stripped about 500 lines out of `robinhood.h` (mostly relating to `unordered_flat_map` which I don't think we have much use for). I refer to this stripped down version as `robinhood-slim` in the benchmarks below (and it's now the tip of this branch).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've been running benchmarks pretty continuously for the last few days and here's a summary of the SSD-based timings:\r\n\r\n![Selection_153](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/64177533-ae9ebe80-ce2d-11e9-977e-47b85b41a9e2.png)\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly it seems that performance improvement is most pronounced with a large dbcache. Presumably this is because as the number of entries in cacheCoins grows, `std::unordered_map`'s performance starts to degrade, `robin_hood` starts to shine, or both.\r\n\r\nI found it interesting that over numerous runs, a large dbcache (7000) ended up being slower across the board than a smaller dbcache (6000 or 3000).\r\n\r\nIn general, the weird timing disparities from these results give me pause. I'm benching on dedicated, non-virtualized hardware that is for no purpose other than benchmarking, and I'm dropping caches before runs (`sudo /sbin/swapoff -a; sudo /sbin/sysctl vm.drop_caches=3;`). Yet we see weird outliers like the 500-minute robinhood reindex at dbcache=5000 - which I didn't believe initially but then reproduced. Why would a dbcache=7000 run take longer than a dbcache=3000? Is the runtime of -reindex-chainstate somehow weirdly determined by the dbcache value during IBD?\r\n\r\nI'm quite confused by some aspects of these results. \r\n\r\nAnyway, here's the memory story:\r\n\r\n![Selection_154](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/64178328-45b84600-ce2f-11e9-98de-cfa28b3ca850.png)\r\n\r\nWe reliably see significant memory savings from the robinhood map.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI also ran -reindex-chainstate to 550,000 on equivalent machines with HDDs. The disparity between master and this branch has been almost unbelievable, but I've reliably reproduced it even after doing machine crossover. The following table is characteristic of the -reindex-chainstates I've done on HDD:\r\n\r\n| branch | dbcache | time | memory |\r\n| ------ | ------- | ---- | ------ |\r\n| robinhood | 5000 | 8:46:59 | 6.38 GB |\r\n| master | 5000 | 21:32:58 (stopped early) | 7.47 GB |\r\n\r\nSimilarly, IBD to the same height with the same dbcache took 47 hours on master (!?) and 17 hours on this branch.\r\n\r\nI'm just kind of assuming these results are bogus somehow, although I'm very confused by the fact that I can reliably reproduce them even after swapping machines, but maybe someone with a spinning disk can confirm or deny that there's a dramatic difference in performance between this branch and master.",

The fact that we can get performance improvements too really suggests to me that switching to a *specific* implementation would be a good idea. So concept ACK.\r\n\r\nAgree with need for intense care and testing to avoid a surprise protocol change. Bundling like LevelDB seems best if it's a lot of code.\r\n\r\nAs far as issues with bad hashes - we don't want to enable intentionally-crafted transactions to screw over performance, so might need to re-hash with some seed?",

      "body": "> Status of this?\r\n\r\nI think using a custom allocator from #16801 is a much safer choice than switching to a different map implementation.Writing a correct and fast hashmap is orders of magnitudes more difficult than a custom allocator. This PR was good though that it has highlighted what could be possible. Most of the performance benefit can be achieved with the custom allocator as well \r\n\r\nConcerning benchmark reproducibility, I believe @jamesob has stumbled upon a pretty severe performance bug, but we don't know yet if this is due to the new code or maybe the optimizations trigger an existing bug more often: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17060#issuecomment-544367528",
