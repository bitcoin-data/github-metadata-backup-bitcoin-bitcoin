    "body": "Made 2 changes to `tests/functional/rpc_fundrawtransaction.py`- \r\n\r\n1. **Remove test_simple_two_coins** - The current test_simple_two_coins and test_simple are identical and redundant. The test_simple_two_coins was changed in #6417  and asserts ensuring the use of two input coins were removed.\r\n2. **Use changepos to get the change output** - In test_address_reuse the code to get the change output assumes that a coin with a value > 2 BTC was used to fund the transaction, and therefore change value will be greater than 1 BTC. This can fail if previous tests add a small coin. fundrawtransaction directly gives the index of change output as changepos, we use this to get the change output more reliably and cleanly.\r\n",
