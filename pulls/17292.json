    "body": "This PR is related to #17268.\r\n\r\nIt adds a mempool stress test which makes a really big complicated tx graph, and then, similar to mempool_eviction test, trims the size.\r\n\r\nThe test setup is to make 100 original transactions with Rand(10)+2 outputs each.\r\n\r\nThen, 800 times:\r\n\r\nwe create a new transaction with Rand(10) + 1 parents that are randomly sampled from all existing transactions (with unspent outputs). From each such parent, we then select Rand(remaining outputs) +1 50% of the time, or 1 outputs 50% of the time.\r\n\r\nThen, we trim the size to 3/4. Then we trim it to just a single transaction.\r\n\r\nThis creates, hopefully, a big bundle of transactions with lots of complex structure, that should really put a strain on the mempool graph algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ends up testing both the descendant and ancestor tracking.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't love that the test is \"unstable\". That is, in order to compare this test to another, you really can't modify any of the internal state because it will have a different order of invocations of the deterministic randomness. However, it certainly suffices for comparing branches.\r\n\r\n",
