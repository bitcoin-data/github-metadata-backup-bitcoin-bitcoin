    "body": "This is a rewrite of the block storage and validation engine.\n\nInstead of blkindex.dat (a database with block tree data, and all transactions and their spendings in the active chain), it uses chain.dat (only block tree data) and coins.dat (pruned txout set). These two databases together are significantly smaller than blkindex.dat (<200 MiB), and only coins.dat is actively needed during block validation, speeding it up significantly (15 minutes for importing 185000 blocks from a local disk file).\n\nBlocks are still stored in blk????.dat files, in the same file format, but smaller files (up to 128 MiB). To prevent excessive fragmentation, they are allocated in chunks of 16 MiB, and some statistics are kept about them. To assist with reorganisation, undo files are created (rev????.dat), which contain the data necessary to undo block connections.\n\nBlock pruning itself is not yet implemented, but this makes it trivial to do so; all that is required is deleting old block and undo files when certain thresholds are reached. Also note that this block pruning mechanism is different from the transaction pruning mechanism described by Satoshi. This one does not prevent a node from acting as a full node.\n\nAll commits result in a functional code tree, with succeeding unit tests. The first few add some extra classes, without changing actual semantics. \"One file per block\" and \"Multiple blocks per file\" form a refactor of the block storage mechanism, with related database changes. \"Do not store hashNext on disk\" only introduces a forward-incompatible change that simplifies the database layout. \"Ultraprune\" itself contains the switch from txindex.dat to coins.dat as validation data, and contains the majority of the changes. What follows are optimizations and other some improvements, that do not effect compatibility.\n\nThere are a few TODO's left (see comment below), but I'd like to give the code some exposure already.\n",

The code in here should be stable and can be tested.\n\nThe only things that remain to be done are automatic import of old data, and more elaborate consistency checks at startup. I think those can be done in separate pull requests though.\n\nThis branch has its own LevelDB glue, independent (though similar, but simpler) from the one in Mike's leveldb branch. As the coin and block indexes are only opened once, there was no need for a CDB-like wrapper and global CDBEnv to cache database accessors. If LevelDB is merged first, I'll add reverts for most of it here.\n",

      "message": "Ultraprune\n\nThis switches bitcoin's transaction/block verification logic to use a\n\"coin database\", which contains all unredeemed transaction output scripts,\namounts and heights.\n\nThe name ultraprune comes from the fact that instead of a full transaction\nindex, we only (need to) keep an index with unspent outputs. For now, the\nblocks themselves are kept as usual, although they are only necessary for\nserving, rescanning and reorganizing.\n\nThe basic datastructures are CCoins (representing the coins of a single\ntransaction), and CCoinsView (representing a state of the coins database).\nThere are several implementations for CCoinsView. A dummy, one backed by\nthe coins database (coins.dat), one backed by the memory pool, and one\nthat adds a cache on top of it. FetchInputs, ConnectInputs, ConnectBlock,\nDisconnectBlock, ... now operate on a generic CCoinsView.\n\nThe block switching logic now builds a single cached CCoinsView with\nchanges to be committed to the database before any changes are made.\nThis means no uncommitted changes are ever read from the database, and\nshould ease the transition to another database layer which does not\nsupport transactions (but does support atomic writes), like LevelDB.\n\nFor the getrawtransaction() RPC call, access to a txid-to-disk index\nwould be preferable. As this index is not necessary or even useful\nfor any other part of the implementation, it is not provided. Instead,\ngetrawtransaction() uses the coin database to find the block height,\nand then scans that block to find the requested transaction. This is\nslow, but should suffice for debug purposes.",

While it is possible to check against the claimed PoW, it is not possible without the previous header to check that the claimed PoW is itself valid.\r\n* It claims \"1 <= vtx count <= max\". However, with the header alone and current consensus rules, the number of transactions is unknown.",
