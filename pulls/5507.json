    "body": "This is a regression in 0.10 that does not appear in 0.9.x.\n\nvBlocksInFlight, mapBlocksInFlight and friends can be remotely inflated by supplying an excessive number of block inv messages with garbage hashes.  In my local testing, it took about 10 minutes to pump in 1GB of bad inv messages, resulting in 6GB of memory usage and 30GB of outbound getheaders data from bitcoind.  After a malicious client disconnects, the memory may be reused, but does not appear to be released back to the operating system.\n\nThe 0.9.x code started applying a 10 point ban penalty at 5000 blocks in flight leading to a ban at 5010 , while under headers first we shouldn't see more than 16.  It's probably good to have some headroom to prevent buggy or older software from getting banned, but the numbers here are just reasonable guesstimates.\n\nI don't like fixed constants, and while MAX_DOWNLOADS_PER_PEER seems to make sense here, I like the idea of leaving some headroom.  This bumps it down to 2000 blocks and uses an existing constant that won't be changing soon.  \n\nThis will probably be superceded by #4831, or something built upon it, but a patch for 0.10 seems prudent.\n\nI've tested by sync'ing from genesis, and multiple runs catching up tip-48h to tip.  No problems were observed.\n",

      "body": "Nice catch, this is indeed a problem.\n\nI'm less sure about the solution. MarkBlockAsInFlight is only called as a result of a local decision to start fetching a block, so if it overflows, it just means the logic for decision to download blocks in the first place is wrong.\n\nSo, there are two possible code paths that lead to a decision to download a block. One is the 'normal' headers-based synchronization: see the FindNextBlocksToDownload() call in main.cpp:SendMessages. This one should properly take the number of blocks in flight into account, and can always function as a fallback.\n\nThe other is the 'direct download' optimized path, in the \"inv\" handling in main.cppProcessMessage, which only works in the case we assume we're already very close to syncing, and is there to reduce latency in waiting for SendMessages, plus avoids a roundtrip between asking the headers and asking the block.\n\nI think the solution is just disabling the second mechanism in case we're already downloading too many blocks from the peer under consideration. We shouldn't look at the total number in flight for this, though, as that would lead to a potential DoS where a few peers spam block announcements, and avoid using the optimized fetching from honest peers.\n",
