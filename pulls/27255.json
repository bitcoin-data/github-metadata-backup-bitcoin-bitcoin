    "body": "Miniscript was targeting P2WSH, and as such can currently only be used in `wsh()` descriptors. This pull request introduces support for Tapscript in Miniscript and makes Miniscript available inside `tr()` descriptors. It adds support for both watching *and* signing TapMiniscript descriptors.\r\n\r\nThe main changes to Miniscript for Tapscript are the following:\r\n- A new `multi_a` fragment is introduced with the same semantics as `multi`. Like in other descriptors `multi` and `multi_a` can exclusively be used in respectively P2WSH and Tapscript.\r\n- The `d:` fragment has the `u` property under Tapscript, since the `MINIMALIF` rule is now consensus. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24906.\r\n- Keys are now serialized as 32 bytes. (Note this affects the key hashes.)\r\n- The resource consumption checks and calculation changed. Some limits were lifted in Tapscript, and signatures are now 64 bytes long.\r\n\r\nThe largest amount of complexity probably lies in the last item. Scripts under Taproot can now run into the maximum stack size while executing a fragment. For instance if you've got a stack size of `999` due to the initial witness plus some execution that happened before and try to execute a `hash256` it would `DUP` (increasing the stack size `1000`), `HASH160` and then push the hash on the stack making the script fail.\r\nTo make sure this does not happen on any of the spending paths of a sane Miniscript, we introduce a tracking of the maximum stack size during execution of a fragment. See the commits messages for details. Those commits were separated from the resource consumption change, and the fuzz target was tweaked to sometimes pad the witness so the script runs on the brink of the stack size limit to make sure the stack size was not underestimated.\r\n\r\nExisting Miniscript unit, functional and fuzz tests are extended with Tapscript logic and test cases. Care was taken for seed stability in the fuzz targets where we cared more about them.\r\n\r\nThe design of Miniscript for Tapscript is the result of discussions between various people over the past year(s). To the extent of my knowledge at least Pieter Wuille, Sanket Kanjalkar, Andrew Poelstra and Andrew Chow contributed thoughts and ideas.",

Just have the following conservative bound: refuse any script whose size is larger than `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT - (1 + 65) * MAX_STACK_SIZE - TAPROOT_CONTROL_MAX_SIZE` (i.e. `329871` bytes). This is still plenty, and should there ever be a usecase for a larger script we can always relax this check by having an accurate max witness size calculation.",

          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

I also noticed [bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) has been updated.\r\n\r\nHas there been any thought into how MuSig2 (and threshold friends) would fit into this in the future? I guess that's only a problem for the compiler, since for the purpose of script it doesn't matter if e.g. public key C is an aggregate of A + B. But it does change the meaning of something like `tr(C,multi_a(2,A,B))` (i.e. regular tapscript multisig fallback if MuSig2 coordination fails - maybe not a good example, since this already works).",

      "body": "Reviewers, i've seen the comments i'm going to address them soon and rebase this.\r\n\r\nI have discussed this with @sipa in person today. A couple notes from my recollection:\r\n- I introduce the `diff` (net difference in stack size before and after executing a fragment) and `exec` (maximum stack size reached during execution) here to account for the maximum stack size at all time. Pieter noticed we may be able to express the size in function of the diff. Or vice versa.\r\n- We tried to assert this property in the fuzz test.\r\n- We noticed `or_i` is the only fragment with two possible canonical dissatisfactions. If both dissatisfactions are available (only if both fragments are `d`) we choose the one with the largest stack size. But it seems unnecessary, the satisfier would always choose the smallest one. But the satisfier chooses in function of the actual witness size (not stack size) so it could be checking the dissatisfaction with the largest stack size.\r\n\r\nWe'll see if we can introduce some of this to the existing code and rebase this on top.",

(thanks for the review!)\r\n- I fixed the `multi_a` satisfaction to use an algorithm similar to `multi`'s.\r\n- Modified the maximum script size to account for some breathing room for the spending transaction size.\r\n- Made the execution size accounting easier by not tracking the size of the stack after execution of a fragment, instead assuming the maximum amount of stack elements the fragment can consume were consumed. The number of items pushed is an invariant on the type (1 for `B` `K` and `W`, 0 for `V`). See the code comments for more details.",

          "title": "Fuzz: a more efficient descriptor parsing target",
          "body": "The current descriptor parsing fuzz target requires valid public or private keys to be provided. This is unnecessary as we are only interested in fuzzing the descriptor parsing logic here (other targets are focused on fuzzing keys serializations). And it's pretty inefficient, especially for formats that need a checksum (`xpub`, `xprv`, WIF).\r\n\r\nThis introduces a new target that mocks the keys as an index in a list of precomputed keys. Keys are represented as 2 hex characters in the descriptor. The key type (private, public, extended, ..) is deterministically based on this one-byte value. Keys are deterministically generated at target initialization. This is much more efficient and also largely reduces the size of the seeds.\r\nTL;DR: for instance instead of requiring the fuzzer to generate a `pk(xpub6DdBu7pBoyf7RjnUVhg8y6LFCfca2QAGJ39FcsgXM52Pg7eejUHLBJn4gNMey5dacyt4AjvKzdTQiuLfRdK8rSzyqZPJmNAcYZ9kVVEz4kj)` to parse a valid descriptor, it just needs to generate a `pk(03)`.\r\n\r\nNote we only mock the keys themselves, not the entire descriptor key expression. As we want to fuzz the real code that parses the rest of the key expression (origin, derivation paths, ..).\r\n\r\nThis is a target i used for reviewing #17190 and #27255, and figured it was worth PR'ing on its own since the added complexity for mocking the keys is minimal and it could help prevent introducing bugs to the descriptor parsing logic much more efficiently.",

As a consequence, Tapscript public keys would be serialized back into the PSBT input as `PSBT_IN_BIP32_DERIVATION`.\r\n\r\nThis is unnecessary. Instead i pushed a modification that simply adds a new field to `SignatureData` so we have a separate mapping for Tapscript keys in the signing logic that is not serialized back into the PSBT input.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Expand to see the diff</summary>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/psbt.cpp b/src/psbt.cpp\r\nindex a06f89cb3d..7d50402324 100644\r\n--- a/src/psbt.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/psbt.cpp\r\n@@ -131,7 +131,7 @@ void PSBTInput::FillSignatureData(SignatureData& sigdata) const\r\n     }\r\n     for (const auto& [pubkey, leaf_origin] : m_tap_bip32_paths) {\r\n         sigdata.taproot_misc_pubkeys.emplace(pubkey, leaf_origin);\r\n-        sigdata.misc_pubkeys.emplace(Hash160(pubkey), std::make_pair(pubkey.GetCPubKey(), leaf_origin.second));\r\n+        sigdata.tap_pubkeys.emplace(Hash160(pubkey), pubkey);\r\n     }\r\n     for (const auto& [hash, preimage] : ripemd160_preimages) {\r\n         sigdata.ripemd160_preimages.emplace(std::vector<unsigned char>(hash.begin(), hash.end()), preimage);\r\n@@ -246,7 +246,7 @@ void PSBTOutput::FillSignatureData(SignatureData& sigdata) const\r\n     }\r\n     for (const auto& [pubkey, leaf_origin] : m_tap_bip32_paths) {\r\n         sigdata.taproot_misc_pubkeys.emplace(pubkey, leaf_origin);\r\n-        sigdata.misc_pubkeys.emplace(Hash160(pubkey), std::make_pair(pubkey.GetCPubKey(), leaf_origin.second));\r\n+        sigdata.tap_pubkeys.emplace(Hash160(pubkey), pubkey);\r\n     }\r\n }\r\n \r\ndiff --git a/src/script/sign.cpp b/src/script/sign.cpp\r\nindex 515a296d60..b4af979f85 100644\r\n--- a/src/script/sign.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/script/sign.cpp\r\n@@ -113,12 +113,17 @@ static bool GetPubKey(const SigningProvider& provider, const SignatureData& sigd\r\n         pubkey = it->second.first;\r\n         return true;\r\n     }\r\n-    // Look for pubkey in pubkey list\r\n+    // Look for pubkey in pubkey lists\r\n     const auto& pk_it = sigdata.misc_pubkeys.find(address);\r\n     if (pk_it != sigdata.misc_pubkeys.end()) {\r\n         pubkey = pk_it->second.first;\r\n         return true;\r\n     }\r\n+    const auto& tap_pk_it = sigdata.tap_pubkeys.find(address);\r\n+    if (tap_pk_it != sigdata.tap_pubkeys.end()) {\r\n+        pubkey = tap_pk_it->second.GetCPubKey();\r\n+        return true;\r\n+    }\r\n     // Query the underlying provider\r\n     return provider.GetPubKey(address, pubkey);\r\n }\r\ndiff --git a/src/script/sign.h b/src/script/sign.h\r\nindex f46bc55992..1cd82a7764 100644\r\n--- a/src/script/sign.h\r\n+++ b/src/script/sign.h\r\n@@ -79,6 +79,7 @@ struct SignatureData {\r\n     std::vector<unsigned char> taproot_key_path_sig; /// Schnorr signature for key path spending\r\n     std::map<std::pair<XOnlyPubKey, uint256>, std::vector<unsigned char>> taproot_script_sigs; ///< (Partial) schnorr signatures, indexed by XOnlyPubKey and leaf_hash.\r\n     std::map<XOnlyPubKey, std::pair<std::set<uint256>, KeyOriginInfo>> taproot_misc_pubkeys; ///< Miscellaneous Taproot pubkeys involved in this input along with their leaf script hashes and key origin data.

Even if there are script paths. This can lead to pretty severe fee underestimation if the script path turns out to be used in the end. So instead assume the most expensive between all script paths and the key path will be used.\r\n\r\nThis is still not ideal, as there may be a huge gap between the size of a script path spend and a key path spend. Still, this is less bad than undershooting the fees.",

Built fine and tests passed on MacOS Ventura.\r\n\r\n- There are more multisig related tests not touched by this PR that seem to need a Tapscript/`multi_a `equivalent added (e.g. wallet_multisig_descriptor_psbt.py). The `multi_a` descriptor leaks into a lot of the multisig code, tests and documentation. It might be best to leave that for other PRs (and possibly other authors) but some sort of issue/plan for what needs to be done post this PR would be nice.\r\n- sipa's [site](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) that I personally use as the go-to resource (or spec) on Miniscript has some documentation on Tapscript but the Miniscript analyzer doesn't take Tapscript Miniscripts (or at least it doesn't analyze `multi_a` descriptors). That is a handy tool for reviewers, testers, implementers.\r\n\r\nedit: I forgot support for the `multi_a` **descriptor** i.e. `tr(KEY, multi_a)` has already been merged in #24043, this PR is adding support for the `multi_a` **Miniscript fragment**,e.g. a Miniscript that contains a `multi_a` within it e.g. `tr(KEY, Miniscript that includes a multi_a)` or `tr(KEY,{S1, Miniscript that includes a multi_a})` Also, `sortedmulti_a` is only a descriptor and not a Miniscript fragment and so not included in this PR.",

Also fixed a bug in commit 8288091031b481d59cc2b5894fa790a70654496a (\"miniscript: don't anticipate signature presence in `CalcStackSize()`\") where i overlooked how the patch applied to more than one `case:` within the `switch` statement.\r\n\r\n@michaelfolkson thanks for having a look here.\r\nRegarding the `multi_a` tests: half of this PR is already tests, exercising the code introduced here under a large number of different scenarii. I'll leave it to others to try to find blind posts in the pre-existing tests for Tapscript multisigs compared to former multisigs.\r\nRegarding Pieter's website, i plan to PR MiniTapscript support to [`sipa/miniscript`](https://github.com/sipa/miniscript/) once it's merged here. So i don't expect it to be available on the website before then. It should be trivial to achieve the same using the Miniscript unit tests here though.",

Here is a list of the changes i've made:\r\n- Addressed @sipa's comments:\r\n  - Added a couple assertions in `ComputeType` for context-specific fragments.\r\n  - Made the \"minimum viable transaction\" size calculation explicit instead of a magic \"800 WU\" value. This introduced some constant values, which i've tried to document extensively.\r\n  - The `GetCPubKey` method introduced to `CPubKey` was renamed to `GetEvenCorrespondingCPubKey` to make its name explicit. I've removed the now-redundant doc-comment.\r\n  - In the fuzz targets, `ConsumeNodeSmart` now always returns only valid recipes for each context. `ConsumeNodeStable` was also modified to return early on a fragment invalid for a context. The check to ignore those in the caller `GenNode` was removed to assert we always return a recipe from `ConsumeNodeSmart` and that it's valid (it would make the fuzzer crash otherwise).\r\n- Changed the API to only ask for a `MiniscriptContext` (either Tapscript or P2WSH) instead of a whole (`Ctx` template) context object wherever we only needed the script context. This makes the API nicer as we often know the script context when calling for instance `IsValid()` on a node, without necessarily having a parsing/satisfying context at hand. For instance, this helped not overusing globals in the fuzzer. (Not that i'm trying to optimize for the tests, but i think it was an indication that the API could be improved.)\r\n- In the fuzz targets, the `MiniscriptContext` is now directly passed to `GenNode`, `TestNode`, etc.. instead of relying on it being set indirectly through the global parsing/satisfying contexts.\r\n- All the introduction of Tapscript in the fuzzing targets was moved to the appropriate commit. Previously part of it was in the commit introducing the `multi_a` fragment, which made the changes to the fuzzer a bit harder to follow.\r\n- To make sure the change in the max script size calculation mentioned above didn't introduce a bug, i've added a functional test that sanity checks we can spend a maximum-sized TapMiniscript (last commit).\r\n- Found an occurrence we had missed in #27117. Added a commit for this (the first one).\r\n- In addition to compiling and passing the unit tests, all commits now pass the `miniscript_smart` fuzzer (on my own corpus which contains Tapscript seeds).",

At this point in time, code nits probably aren't going to be useful either.\r\n\r\nThis draft has been posted to provide a tangible example of a softfork we might pursue, and a representation of the necessary code changes.\r\n\r\n### Activation method and parameters\r\n\r\nSpecific activation parameters have not been specified here (or are marked FIXME) to avoid putting the consensus cart before the horse. The activation method here has defaulted to the one used for BIP-0341 and might change pending discussion.",

          "body": "`InferDescriptor` was not always checking that the pubkey it was placing into the descriptor was an allowed pubkey. For example, given a P2WPKH script that uses an uncompressed pubkey, it would produce a `wpkh()` with the uncompressed key. Additionally, the hybrid key check was only being done for `pk()` scripts, where it should've been done for all scripts.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the key checking into `InferPubkey`. If the key is not valid for the context, then `nullptr` is returned and the inferring will fall through to the defaults of either `raw()` or `addr()`.\r\n\r\nThis also resolves an issue with migrating legacy wallets that contain hybrid pubkeys as such watchonly scripts will become `raw()` or `addr()` and go to the watchonly wallet. Note that a legacy wallet cannot sign for hybrid pubkeys. A test has been added for the migration case.\r\n\r\nAlso added unit tests for `InferDescriptor` itself as the edge cases with that function are not covered by the descriptor roundtrip test.",

I just want to get the idea out here, I don't consider this a requirement for this PR (as you know, I was fine with a much more approximate approach too).\r\n\r\nThe idea is to reason backwards. We know that every satisfaction of the overall script ends with a single stack item (a 1). From that endpoint, it seems possible to me to reason backwards through all possible execution paths and compute their maximal stack size at every point. Taking the maximum of that should give the desired limit.\r\n\r\nTo implement this, I think you need almost exactly what this commit is already doing, just reasoning in reverse: e.g. taking the maximum of the execution maximum of the second part and the execution maximum of the first plus the net effect of a second part.",
