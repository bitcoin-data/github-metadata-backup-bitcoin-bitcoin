    "body": "This is based on #1408 and gives a preview of the goal of the rebase as a whole.  It provides a CBlockStore class to store the block chain and allows CHub to call it and returns data to CHub.  If it gets merged, CTxMemPool will be adapted to call CBlockStore functions to get info on previous transactions, and a CAlertStorage class will be added.  \n\nI would prefer to not do callbacks from CBlockStore, but I found that cleaner than returning a list of blocks committed (as each call to EmitBlock can commit any number of blocks) through many of the block acceptance functions and back to CHub::EmitBlock, buf if that design is preferred, its not hard to do that.\n\nIn general, though CBlockStore effectively turns several CHub functions into NOOPs, I prefer using a CHub as a convenience class so that CWallet/P2P client don't have to know something about CBlockStore and CTxMemPool and CAlertStore, but only needs to know one API.  It also removes the need to duplicate much of the code to deal with callback threads in the storage classes.\n\nObviously this does little actual abstraction, but just creates the class and moves functions from CBlock, if it gets merged, things like mapBlockIndex will get moved into CBlockStore.\n",

          "body": "This is based on cblockstore and commits blocks in a separate thread from downloading/initial checking (in CheckBlock).  It offers a nice performance gain over cblockstore alone.\n- pfrom->Misbehaving is now called in a callback instead of after EmitBlock as nDoS is not known until the block is committed.  This could give us a bit more work to do from a bad node's blocks, but should be pretty safe as the buffer is limited to 20 blocks by default (-blockbuffersize).\n- A setBlocksSeen is added which holds a set of blocks which have passed basic DOS checks (CheckBlock and the minwork computations), ie is the list of orphans + accepted blocks.  This allows us to avoid cs_main locking when doing the duplicate detection in the initial checking\n- FinishEmitBlock callbacks are done in series and, therefore, CBlockStore had to be changed to allow for InOrder callback threads.  Though FinishEmitBlock callbacks could be called out of order, this would result in a significant number of \"orphan\" blocks being committed before being merged into the main block tree, which is pretty ugly and inefficiency.  \n- GetLastCheckpoint now returns a cached value instead of scanning mapBlockIndex each time.  This is primarily to avoid a cs_main lock in the initial checking, but is also a micro-optimization.  \n",

It also moves\n    CWalletTx::AcceptWalletTransaction to wallet.cpp\n\n * This adds a fCheckInputs flag to EmitTransaction, which is\n    similar to the fCheckInputs flag to AcceptToMemoryPool,\n    however, it has stricter guidlines that it should only be set\n    \"when transaction is a supporting tx for one of our own.\"\n    Additionally, \"fCheckInputs is ignored (and set to true)\n    if !IsInitialBlockDownload() && !fClient\"\n\n    As a part of these guidelines,\n    CWalletTx::AcceptWalletTransaction calls EmitTransaction with\n    fCheckInputs set to true (the default) on the final\n    transaction, whereas it used to call with fCheckInputs set to\n    false. This has the important side-effect of allowing wallet-\n    generated transactions to end up getting AddOrphanTx'd.\n    However, if a supporting transaction to one of our own had\n    previously been AddOrphanTx'd, it would immediately be added\n    to memory pool as it is \"a supporting tx for one of our own\"\n    and thus is re-added with fCheckInputs=false.\n\n    Note that the possibility of a wallet transaction getting\n    AddOrphanTx'd is very low, and should only happen if\n    a) a transaction's input is a generate and we are missing that\n       block (note that no transactions should be generated with a\n       generation input if we don't have that block anyway).\n    b) We match the !IsInitialBlockDownload() && !fClient check,\n       are not caught up to the latest block, and an input is in a\n       block we do not yet have (possible after the last\n       checkpoint). This situation is temporary and should resolve\n       itself once we catch up (though AddOrphanTx'd transactions\n       may be permanently orphaned).\n\n    Largely, these guidelines are there because there is no reason\n    to add a transaction without checking its inputs, as we have\n    those inputs available, and checking them as any other\n    transaction would provides additional sanity-checks.\n\n * A second EmitTransaction was added with tx of type CMerkleTx.\n    This keeps behavior of CMerkleTx::AcceptToMemoryPool the same\n    in fClient mode. Note that new behavior was invented for\n    CHub::EmitTransaction(CTransaction&...) in fClient mode,\n    namely that ClientConnectInputs is only checked if\n    fCheckInputs is true. This was chosen to make emitting a\n    transaction possible in fClient mode even if its inputs are\n    not available, but could be changed if support for that is not\n    needed when fClient mode is actually implemented.",
