          "body": "To prevent endless issues when running the linters locally (say, on specific versions of bash, or system tools having certain names, or a certain implementation of `sed`, etc) , as well as for maintainability/reviewability, it's preferred for linter scripts to be written in Python.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of scripts, feel free to pick up any that haven't been ported:\r\n\r\n- [x] `test/lint/check-doc.py` (added in #7280, was always Python)\r\n- [ ] `test/lint/git-subtree-check.sh` (in progress in #25039)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-all.sh` (ported in #24982)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-assertions.sh` (ported in #24856)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-circular-dependencies.sh` (ported in #24915)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-cpp.sh` (removed in #24785)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-files.py` (added in #21740, was always Python)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-format-strings.sh` (ported in #24802)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-git-commit-check.sh` (ported in #24853)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-include-guards.sh` (ported in #24902)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-includes.sh` (ported in #24895)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-locale-dependence.sh` (ported in #24932)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-logs.sh` (ported in #24849)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-python-dead-code.py` (ported in #24778)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-python-mutable-default-parameters.sh` (ported in #24800)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-python.sh` (ported in #24794)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-python-utf8-encoding.sh` (ported in #24916)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-qt.sh` (removed in #24790)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-shell-locale.sh` (ported in #24929)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-shell.sh` (ported in #24840)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-spelling.py` (ported in #24766)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-submodule.sh` (ported in #24803)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-tests.sh` (ported in #24815)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/lint-whitespace.sh` (ported in #24844)\r\n- [x] `test/lint/run-lint-format-strings.py` (added in #13705, was always Python)\r\n\r\nAlthough I try to keep this post up to date, before starting on a linter, please first do a github search in PRs to see if a PR for that already exists.\r\n\r\n#### Guidelines\r\n\r\n- Don't forget to update `test/README.md` when the name of a script changes.\r\n- Avoid `shell=true` on subprocess calls. Remember that the point here is to avoid shell ambiguities.\r\n- If possible, avoid calling out to subprocesses at all and use what Python APIs provide (say,  `grep`  `sed` `awk` `sha256sum`). An exception if this would introduce further dependencies that need to be installed. These are OK to use subprocess for:\r\n  - `git` subcommands including `git grep`—the alternative would be to require an extra dependency on a Python git module, also, `git` can be assumed to be the same implementation everywhere\r\n  - Other scripts in the source tree.\r\n  - External linters (`vulture`, `codespell`, etc) that provide only a command-based interface.\r\n- Some further recommendations about Python usage here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24766#pullrequestreview-932953476 \r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\n- Python\r\n- Being able to read shell script\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
