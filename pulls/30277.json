    "body": "Erlay Project Tracking: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30249\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a full implementation of Erlay. Its purpose is to check the integrity and correctness of the implementation against changes/additions that may originate from the review process and/or rebases on top of newer functionality.\r\n\r\nThis is not to be merged. Functionality will be spread across multiple smaller PRs to ease the review process.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Approach \r\n\r\nThe implementation approach builds on the following assumptions:\r\n\r\n- Fanout (the current relay method) is faster than Erlay, but less bandwidth efficient\r\n- Fanout is optimal if the node we want to announce a certain transaction doesn't know about it (but of course, we don't have that information)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general approach works as follows:\r\n\r\nReconciliation is used alongside fanout to relay transactions across the network. For Erlay nodes, the relay method will be decided per-transaction, instead of per connection, meaning that Erlay connections will do both fanout and reconciliation depending on the transaction (legacy connections will do only fanout, obviously).\r\n\r\nThe parameters selected for fanout are minimized to maximize the bandwidth saving. The current selected defaults are 4 outbound peers and 10% of inbounds. The relay logic depends on the type of connection and how the transaction has been received:\r\n\r\n- For outbound connections, if the transaction was received via fanout (or originates in us), we fanout until up to N peers know about it. We do this by checking the `m_tx_inventory_known_filter`, so their announcements also count. If the transaction was received via reconciliation, we simply reconcile with the rest of our peers.\r\n- For inbounds, we select 10% of our connections and rotate that selection periodically.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning for this is trying to guess how far the transaction has made it into the network with imperfect information. Knowing that fanout is faster than reconciliation, we want to have a higher fanout rate at the very beginning of the propagation, to get as far as we can, being fully efficient. This can be tied to how many of our peers know about the transaction already. Once the transaction is sufficiently spread, we can just reconcile it with the rest of our peers.\r\nThis does not apply to inbounds, as they are not trusted, and the metric will be easily abused, plus it may be used to leak transaction origin information. For them, we just keep a low fanout rate.\r\n\r\n## Testing and simulating\r\n\r\nThe last two commits of this PR are currently for simulation only. They allow to easily config the inbound/outbound fanout rate without having to recompile the code, and make full reconciliation more efficient.\r\n",
