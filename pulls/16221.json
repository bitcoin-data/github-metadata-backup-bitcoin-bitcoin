I've been unsuccessful so far :-)\r\n\r\nAs with all suppressions this is just a stop-gap to make `test_deterministic_coverage.sh` usable for guarding against the introduction of _new_ non-determinism until the source of non-determinism has been fixed.\r\n\r\nI'm running `contrib/devtools/test_deterministic_coverage.sh` continuously against `master` on a testing server to find any introduction of _new_ non-determinism in our tests: that's why I'm eager to get suppressions in for the remaining _known_ cases.
