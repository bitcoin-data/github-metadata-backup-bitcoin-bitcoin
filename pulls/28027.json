    "body": "It was somewhat surprising to me that wallet_backwards_compatibility.py did not catch #27915 since the purpose of the test is to find downgrade issues such as that. It turns out the test was deficient in several places when it came to testing descriptor wallets, as well as deficient in addition to failing to correctly test some releases.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these test cases, adds more informative logging, slightly refactors the entire test in order to better test future versions, and adds a 25.0 node to the test.\r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n* The compatibility test with 0.16 should not have been passing. The wallets were being copied incorrectly for 0.16 and resulting in 0.16 creating new wallets rather than testing the target wallets.\r\n* The downgrade test will actually be run on descriptor wallets and it will test that downgrades are successful, and a subsequent upgrade is also successful. This catches #27915.\r\n* The upgrade and downgrade test will be run on all versions up to master, rather than just 0.16, 0.17, and 0.19.",
