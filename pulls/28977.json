    "body": "Gutter Guard Selector bounds the worst case on coin selection outcomes by ensuring that there is at least one candidate input set that exceeds the minimal necessary input count by at most three.\r\n\r\nDoes a random selection limited to three more output groups than largest-first selection would select to fund the transaction. If the limit is exceeded during selection, the output group with the lowest effective value is discarded.\r\n\r\nMotivations\r\n---\r\n\r\n- At high feerates, using unnecessary inputs can [significantly increase the fees](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/120408/5406)\r\n- Users are upset when fees are relatively large compared to the amount sent\r\n- [Minimizing the input set](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27877) is an NP-hard problem\r\n- Always minimizing the weight of the input set can lead to fragmentation of the wallet’s UTXO pool\r\n\r\nApproach\r\n---\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core uses multiple coin selection algorithms to generate candidate input sets. It then picks the least wasteful input set per the weight metric, but none of the deployed algorithms explicitly look for low-weight input sets. Gutter Guard Selector determines a likely minimum count `c` of output groups that are necessary to fund the transaction via largest-first selection. It then randomly selects output groups into a lowest-effective-value heap. If the heap exceeds `c + 3` output groups, the output group with the lowest-effective value is discarded. It then checks whether the selection can fund the transaction. This approach will always succeed given the effective value available exceeds the selection target.\r\n\r\nTrade-offs\r\n---\r\n\r\nLargest-first selection (LF) (and to a lesser degree an approach that minimizes the weight of an input set) might grind a wallet’s UTXO pool to dust if overused. Incoming payments grow the wallet’s UTXO pool, while transactions with a single input and a change output result in the same UTXO count as before.  LF will additionally decrease range of amounts in the wallet by reducing the amount of the supreme element.\r\n\r\nBranch and Bound looks for a changeless input set. If there are multiple solutions, it prefers the one with the lowest waste, but there might not be a solution, or even the least wasteful one could be composed of many inputs. Knapsack minimizes the distance between target amount and selected amount which is independent from the input set’s weight. Single Random Draw just does a single random drawing from the UTXO pool—if there are a ton of UTXOs in the wallet, this will likely result in a large input set. While we pick the least wasteful among the presented input set candidates, there is no guarantee that any of the three deployed algorithms will produce a thrifty input set.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Gutter Guard Selector is expected to reduce the UTXO pool of a fragmented wallet by at least three UTXOs. When many UTXOs exist that are larger than the target, a solution with fewer inputs and less weight may be found. When transactions with low feerates are being built, the waste metric prefers heavier input sets which may be proposed by other coin selection algorithms anyway. At high feerates, Gutter Guard Selector ensures that there is an input set candidate that isn’t [absurdly wasteful](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/100437/5406) and therefore delimits the worst case.",

          "body": "Adds a coin selection algorithm that minimizes the weight of the input set while creating change.\r\n\r\nMotivations\r\n---\r\n\r\n- At high feerates, using unnecessary inputs can significantly increase the fees\r\n- Users are upset when fees are relatively large compared to the amount sent\r\n- Some users struggle to maintain a sufficient count of UTXOs in their wallet\r\n\r\nApproach\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo far, Bitcoin Core has used a balanced approach to coin selection, where it will generate multiple input set candidates using various coin selection algorithms and pick the least wasteful among their results, but not explicitly minimize the input set weight. Under some circumstances, we _do_ want to minimize the weight of the input set. Sometimes changeless solutions require many or heavy inputs, and there is not always a changeless solution for Branch and Bound to find in the first place. This can cause expensive transactions unnecessarily. Given a wallet with sufficient funds, `CoinGrinder` will pick the minimal-waste input set for a transaction with a change output. The current implementation only runs `CoinGrinder` at feerates over 30 ṩ/vB, which may be a decent compromise between our goal to reduce costs for the users, but still permit transactions at lower feerates to naturally reduce the wallet’s UTXO pool to curb bloat.\r\n\r\nTrade-offs\r\n---\r\n\r\nSimulations for my thesis on coin selection ([see Section 6.3.2.1 [PDF]](https://murch.one/erhardt2016coinselection.pdf)) suggest that minimizing the input set for all transactions tends to grind a wallet’s UTXO pool to dust (pun intended): an approach selecting inputs per coin-age-priority (in effect similar to “largest first selection”) on average produced a UTXO pool with 15× the UTXO count as Bitcoin Core’s Knapsack-based Coin Selection then (in 2016). Therefore, I do not recommend running `CoinGrinder` under all circumstances, but only at extreme feerates or when we have another good reason to minimize the input set for other reasons. In the long-term, we should introduce additional metrics to score different input set candidates, e.g. on basis of their privacy and wallet health impact, to pick from all our coin selection results, but until then, we may want to limit use of `CoinGrinder` in other ways.",
