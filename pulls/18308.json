I opened #15914 and my issue is fixed as long as I have a way to build Boost using Clang by setting environment variables :)  I've now updated #15914 to clarify that.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how the depends build system is supposed to work so I'll let someone else tackle the interaction between `boost_toolset_linux` <> `CC` and `boost_cxx` <> `CXX`. Note that one complication is that `boost_toolset_linux` must be `gcc` or `clang` also when the compiler is say `gcc-8` or `clang-10`.",

The 3 hosts I found offered good coverage were: `{x86_64,i686,riscv64}-linux-gnu`. As we special-case the `x86_64` and `i686` hosts in `depends/hosts/linux.mk`, and `riscv64` is a sanity check for a non-special-cased host.\r\n",
