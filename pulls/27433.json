    "body": "This adds the following commits:\r\n\r\n1. remove unnecessary check for whether SegWit is active\r\n2. drop no longer relevant warning about missing sigops field \r\n3. warn that CheckBlock() underestimates sigops\r\n4. ~mark `default_witness_commitment` result field as not optional~ (_Update 2024-01-09: incorrect, dropped_)\r\n\r\nBased on #26201, because it touches and adds a relevant test to `getblocktemplate`. I can unrebase and pick the test if that PR doesn't make it.\r\n\r\n---\r\nEarlier description, just historical context now.\r\n\r\n**Sigops**\r\n\r\nTwo recent F2Pool blocks violated the sigops limit. Both by 3.\r\n\r\nI suspect they were not using `getblocktemplate`. If you look at the [template](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/00000000000000000004e0ec4f27bd3347381e8e19ed98d7f918e8c1c292ae97) right before the valid block at the same height, which was produced two minutes later, you'll see that it matches the block with 3 small transactions difference. In other words, the valid block producer likely did use `getblocktemplate` around the same time and did not experience an issue.\r\n\r\nIt's also clear by looking at [Mempool.Space](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000004e0ec4f27bd3347381e8e19ed98d7f918e8c1c292ae97) that the valid block excluded many large bare multisig transactions. Those transactions paid more than enough in fees to be included, but we would have excluded them due to running out of sigops.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in `BlockAssembler::addPackageTxs` and `TestPackage` we simply don't add a package to the block if it doesn't fit the remaining weight or sigops. Custom block construction software might not do that. I initially though they might have forgotten to check SegWit related sigops, but that seems unlikely given that they were only off by 3 in both blocks.\r\n\r\nI suspect their mistake was to not count the number of sigops in the coinbase: it pays to legacy P2PKH which uses 4 sigops. Our code reserves 400 sigops for the coinbase, so would not have caused this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n_Update 2024-01-09: I dropped the extra debug fields mentioned here_\r\n\r\nAnyway, while checking our code I added a few extra fields to the block statistics of~ `getblocktemplate`:\r\n\r\n* `sigops`: total sigops for the block excluding the coinbase\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_sigops`: how many sigops we reserve for the coinbase (400)\r\n* `weightlimit`\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_weight`\r\n\r\n~I added a belt and suspenders check for the sigops limit in the RPC code.~ (_update 2024-01-09: dropped_) Note that we already check it when adding packages to a block _and_ in `TestBlockValidity`.\r\n\r\n**Segwit**\r\n\r\n~I also removed the need to set `{\"rules\": \"!segwit\"}`, the generation of pre-segwit blocks, and the test code that checks activation.~ _update 2023-08-18: commit removed_",

      "body": "The \"rules\" field was introduced in #7935. It's not specified in [BIP 22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0022.mediawiki) and [BIP 23](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0023.mediawiki) which describe the expected behaviour of `getblocktemplate`. But then in [BIP 145](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0145.mediawiki) for segwit it's assumed to be there. I'm guessing something in between is documented in Stratum software?\r\n\r\nHere's [an example](https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool/src/73f560cf3144f824823077c1b9e1663d89823ed7/src/bitcoin.c#lines-127:135) of how it's used by pool software. There's also some documentation through bug reports, e.g. #17946. My understanding is that `!` means that it's unsafe to mine without understanding the rule.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear to me how it is intented to be used, both as an argument and in the results. I'm also not sure how to interpret this wording in BIP 145:\r\n\r\n> The '!' rule prefix MUST be enabled on the \"segwit\" rule for templates including transactions with witness data.\r\n\r\nFor 6ab119d4c1c8cf3d9c0994c22d75d016a30cdd6a I have assumed that the consumer of this RPC may care about it, so we keep `!segwit` in the result. I've the read the above sentence as referring only to the result of the RPC. With this commit it doesn't matter if you set it or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @luke-jr",

This introduces compliance issues with more strict clients. There are the major misbehaviors that I found:\r\n- returning non-200 HTTP codes for RPC errors like \"Method not found\" (this is not a server error or an HTTP error)\r\n- returning both `\"error\"` and `\"result\"` fields together in a response object.\r\n- different error-handling behavior for single and batched RPC requests (batches contain errors in the response but single requests will actually throw HTTP errors)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15495 added regression tests after a discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15381 to kinda lock in our RPC behavior to preserve backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12435 was an attempt to allow strict 2.0 compliance behind a flag, but was abandoned. \r\n\r\nThe approach in this PR is not strict and preserves backwards compatibility in a familiar bitcoin-y way: all old behavior is preserved, but new rules are applied to clients that opt in. One of the rules in the [JSON RPC 2.0 spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#request_object) is that the kv pair `\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\"` must be present in the request. Well, let's just use that to trigger strict 2.0 behavior! When that kv pair is included in a request object, the [response will adhere to strict JSON-RPC 2.0 rules](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object), essentially:\r\n\r\n- always return HTTP 200 \"OK\" unless there really is a server error or malformed request\r\n- either return `\"error\"` OR `\"result\"` but never both\r\n- same behavior for single and batch requests\r\n\r\nIf this is merged next steps can be:\r\n\r\n- Refactor bitcoin-cli to always use strict 2.0\r\n- Refactor the python test framework to always use strict 2.0 for everything\r\n- Begin deprecation process for 1.0/1.1 behavior (?)\r\n\r\nIf we can one day remove the old 1.0/1.1 behavior we can clean up the rpc code quite a bit.",

I'll unrebase and pick the test if that PR doesn't make it.\r\n\r\nI dropped 6ab119d4c1c8cf3d9c0994c22d75d016a30cdd6a: it's still necessary for the (mining software) client to tell us it supports SegWit. This is merely a checkbox now.\r\n\r\nIn the context of dropping `segwit` as a required rule I wrote:\r\n\r\n> We do the same thing with `csv`.\r\n\r\nI guess the argument here is that, unlike `segwit`, the `csv` (and `taproot`) soft fork is safe to use by a miner if they simply use the response from `getblocktemplate` without modifying it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extra `sigops`, `coinbase_reserved_sigops` and `coinbase_reserved_weight` field in the result is now tucked behind a `debug` argument.\r\n\r\nHope that addresses @luke-jr's concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the debug-only `coinbase_reserved_` arguments are just repeating a constant`*`, and the `sigops` field is straight-forward to calculate by iterating over all transactions, we can use the `debug` argument in the future to add additional stuff. Things that aid in anticipating what the next block should look like, e.g. for the [Mempool.Space](https://mempool.space) audit feature and @0xB10C's [miningpool.observer](https://miningpool.observer). For example we could expand the `transactions` result with a timestamp of when our mempool first saw it.\r\n\r\nI could however still drop the fields from 09fbc4cbfa7b7d86e6da00a737317151088b4b6c and ac3fcb240af8ef96d4e348548995ec1a536ff531, but keep the `Assume`.\r\n\r\n`*` = given that F2pool shot itself in the foot with custom patches, trying to squeeze out a few more sigops in their blocks, maybe we should make this configurable.",

          "body": "**Conceptual discussion here:** https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/covenant-tools-softfork/98\r\n\r\nThis draft is a patch that activates the consensus changes outlined in\r\n\r\n- [BIP-118](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0118.mediawiki) (SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT for Taproot Scripts)\r\n- [BIP-119](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki) (CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY)\r\n- [BIP-345](https://github.com/jamesob/bips/blob/jamesob-23-02-opvault/bip-0345.mediawiki) (OP_VAULT)\r\n\r\nThese changes make possible a number of use-cases that are broadly beneficial to users of Bitcoin, including\r\n\r\n- [vaults](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/vaults/) (reactive custodial security),\r\n- [LN-Symmetry](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eltoo/),\r\n- efficient implementations of [DLCs](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/discreet-log-contracts/),\r\n- [non-interactive channel openings](https://utxos.org/uses/non-interactive-channels/),\r\n- [congestion control](https://utxos.org/uses/scaling/),\r\n- decentralized mining pools (via [CTV compression in coinbase payouts](https://utxos.org/uses/miningpools/)),\r\n- various [Lightning efficiency improvements](https://twitter.com/roasbeef/status/1692589689939579259),\r\n- using [covenant based timeout-trees](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2023/09/27/) to scale Lightning, and more generally enabling [channel factories](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/channel-factories/).\r\n\r\nWe also see that many speculative scaling solutions (e.g. [Ark](https://arkpill.me/), [Spacechains](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c9f0a92493e06b0e29acced61ca9f49a#spacechains)) require locking coins to be spent to a particular set of outputs without any additional authorization (i.e. CTV, or APO’s emulation of it).\r\n\r\n### Scope of discussion\r\n\r\nTo prevent this thread from becoming overrun, please keep high-level, conceptual discussion to the [related Delving Bitcoin thread](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/covenant-tools-softfork/98). At this point in time, code nits probably aren't going to be useful either.\r\n\r\nThis draft has been posted to provide a tangible example of a softfork we might pursue, and a representation of the necessary code changes.\r\n\r\n### Activation method and parameters\r\n\r\nSpecific activation parameters have not been specified here (or are marked FIXME) to avoid putting the consensus cart before the horse. The activation method here has defaulted to the one used for BIP-0341 and might change pending discussion.",

We've seen in practice that miners sometimes patch template generation code, so additional checks can be helpful. But this particular check would not have worked: the patch set `nBlockSigOpsCost` to `1`, which after SegWit should have been adjusted to 4. Since we have no way to check how many sigops are added to the coinbase, afaik there's nothing we can do catch a bug like that.\r\n\r\n",

I am deeply uninterested in the details of activation semantics.\r\n\r\nThis combination of changes allows for the implementation of a variety of layer two proposals and improvements. Including, but not limited to, Lightning Symmetry, Point-Time-Locked-Contracts, Timeout Trees, and unidirectional non-interactive channels.\r\n\r\nFor anyone interested, I also have a [branch](https://github.com/reardencode/bitcoin/tree/lnhance-v26) with these same changes based on the latest release.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
