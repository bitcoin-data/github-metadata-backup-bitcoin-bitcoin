    "body": "This adds the following commits:\r\n\r\n1. remove unnecessary check for whether SegWit is active\r\n2. drop no longer relevant warning about missing sigops field \r\n3. warn that CheckBlock() underestimates sigops\r\n4. ~mark `default_witness_commitment` result field as not optional~ (_Update 2024-01-09: incorrect, dropped_)\r\n\r\nBased on #26201, because it touches and adds a relevant test to `getblocktemplate`. I can unrebase and pick the test if that PR doesn't make it.\r\n\r\n---\r\nEarlier description, just historical context now.\r\n\r\n**Sigops**\r\n\r\nTwo recent F2Pool blocks violated the sigops limit. Both by 3.\r\n\r\nI suspect they were not using `getblocktemplate`. If you look at the [template](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/00000000000000000004e0ec4f27bd3347381e8e19ed98d7f918e8c1c292ae97) right before the valid block at the same height, which was produced two minutes later, you'll see that it matches the block with 3 small transactions difference. In other words, the valid block producer likely did use `getblocktemplate` around the same time and did not experience an issue.\r\n\r\nIt's also clear by looking at [Mempool.Space](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000004e0ec4f27bd3347381e8e19ed98d7f918e8c1c292ae97) that the valid block excluded many large bare multisig transactions. Those transactions paid more than enough in fees to be included, but we would have excluded them due to running out of sigops.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in `BlockAssembler::addPackageTxs` and `TestPackage` we simply don't add a package to the block if it doesn't fit the remaining weight or sigops. Custom block construction software might not do that. I initially though they might have forgotten to check SegWit related sigops, but that seems unlikely given that they were only off by 3 in both blocks.\r\n\r\nI suspect their mistake was to not count the number of sigops in the coinbase: it pays to legacy P2PKH which uses 4 sigops. Our code reserves 400 sigops for the coinbase, so would not have caused this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n_Update 2024-01-09: I dropped the extra debug fields mentioned here_\r\n\r\nAnyway, while checking our code I added a few extra fields to the block statistics of~ `getblocktemplate`:\r\n\r\n* `sigops`: total sigops for the block excluding the coinbase\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_sigops`: how many sigops we reserve for the coinbase (400)\r\n* `weightlimit`\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_weight`\r\n\r\n~I added a belt and suspenders check for the sigops limit in the RPC code.~ (_update 2024-01-09: dropped_) Note that we already check it when adding packages to a block _and_ in `TestBlockValidity`.\r\n\r\n**Segwit**\r\n\r\n~I also removed the need to set `{\"rules\": \"!segwit\"}`, the generation of pre-segwit blocks, and the test code that checks activation.~ _update 2023-08-18: commit removed_",

      "body": "The \"rules\" field was introduced in #7935. It's not specified in [BIP 22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0022.mediawiki) and [BIP 23](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0023.mediawiki) which describe the expected behaviour of `getblocktemplate`. But then in [BIP 145](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0145.mediawiki) for segwit it's assumed to be there. I'm guessing something in between is documented in Stratum software?\r\n\r\nHere's [an example](https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool/src/73f560cf3144f824823077c1b9e1663d89823ed7/src/bitcoin.c#lines-127:135) of how it's used by pool software. There's also some documentation through bug reports, e.g. #17946. My understanding is that `!` means that it's unsafe to mine without understanding the rule.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear to me how it is intented to be used, both as an argument and in the results. I'm also not sure how to interpret this wording in BIP 145:\r\n\r\n> The '!' rule prefix MUST be enabled on the \"segwit\" rule for templates including transactions with witness data.\r\n\r\nFor 6ab119d4c1c8cf3d9c0994c22d75d016a30cdd6a I have assumed that the consumer of this RPC may care about it, so we keep `!segwit` in the result. I've the read the above sentence as referring only to the result of the RPC. With this commit it doesn't matter if you set it or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @luke-jr",

I'll unrebase and pick the test if that PR doesn't make it.\r\n\r\nI dropped 6ab119d4c1c8cf3d9c0994c22d75d016a30cdd6a: it's still necessary for the (mining software) client to tell us it supports SegWit. This is merely a checkbox now.\r\n\r\nIn the context of dropping `segwit` as a required rule I wrote:\r\n\r\n> We do the same thing with `csv`.\r\n\r\nI guess the argument here is that, unlike `segwit`, the `csv` (and `taproot`) soft fork is safe to use by a miner if they simply use the response from `getblocktemplate` without modifying it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extra `sigops`, `coinbase_reserved_sigops` and `coinbase_reserved_weight` field in the result is now tucked behind a `debug` argument.\r\n\r\nHope that addresses @luke-jr's concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the debug-only `coinbase_reserved_` arguments are just repeating a constant`*`, and the `sigops` field is straight-forward to calculate by iterating over all transactions, we can use the `debug` argument in the future to add additional stuff. Things that aid in anticipating what the next block should look like, e.g. for the [Mempool.Space](https://mempool.space) audit feature and @0xB10C's [miningpool.observer](https://miningpool.observer). For example we could expand the `transactions` result with a timestamp of when our mempool first saw it.\r\n\r\nI could however still drop the fields from 09fbc4cbfa7b7d86e6da00a737317151088b4b6c and ac3fcb240af8ef96d4e348548995ec1a536ff531, but keep the `Assume`.\r\n\r\n`*` = given that F2pool shot itself in the foot with custom patches, trying to squeeze out a few more sigops in their blocks, maybe we should make this configurable.",

We've seen in practice that miners sometimes patch template generation code, so additional checks can be helpful. But this particular check would not have worked: the patch set `nBlockSigOpsCost` to `1`, which after SegWit should have been adjusted to 4. Since we have no way to check how many sigops are added to the coinbase, afaik there's nothing we can do catch a bug like that.\r\n\r\n",
