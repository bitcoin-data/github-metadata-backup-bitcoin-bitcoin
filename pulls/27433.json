    "body": "**Sigops**\r\n\r\nTwo recent F2Pool blocks violated the sigops limit. Both by 3.\r\n\r\nI suspect they were not using `getblocktemplate`. If you look at the [template](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/00000000000000000004e0ec4f27bd3347381e8e19ed98d7f918e8c1c292ae97) right before the valid block at the same height, which was produced two minutes later, you'll see that it matches the block with 3 small transactions difference. In other words, the valid block producer likely did use `getblocktemplate` around the same time and did not experience an issue.\r\n\r\nIt's also clear by looking at [Mempool.Space](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000004e0ec4f27bd3347381e8e19ed98d7f918e8c1c292ae97) that the valid block excluded many large bare multisig transactions. Those transactions paid more than enough in fees to be included, but we would have excluded them due to running out of sigops.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in `BlockAssembler::addPackageTxs` and `TestPackage` we simply don't add a package to the block if it doesn't fit the remaining weight or sigops. Custom block construction software might not do that. I initially though they might have forgotten to check SegWit related sigops, but that seems unlikely given that they were only off by 3 in both blocks.\r\n\r\nI suspect their mistake was to not count the number of sigops in the coinbase: it pays to legacy P2PKH which uses 4 sigops. Our code reserves 400 sigops for the coinbase, so would not have caused this.\r\n\r\nAnyway, while checking our code I added a few extra fields to the block statistics of `getblocktemplate`:\r\n\r\n* `sigops`: total sigops for the block excluding the coinbase\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_sigops`: how many sigops we reserve for the coinbase (400)\r\n* `weightlimit`\r\n* `coinbase_reserved_weight`\r\n\r\nI added a belt and suspenders check for the sigops limit in the RPC code. Note that we already check it when adding packages to a block _and_ in `TestBlockValidity`.\r\n\r\n**Segwit**\r\n\r\n~I also removed the need to set `{\"rules\": \"!segwit\"}`, the generation of pre-segwit blocks, and the test code that checks activation.~ _update 2023-08-18: commit removed_",

      "body": "The \"rules\" field was introduced in #7935. It's not specified in [BIP 22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0022.mediawiki) and [BIP 23](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0023.mediawiki) which describe the expected behaviour of `getblocktemplate`. But then in [BIP 145](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0145.mediawiki) for segwit it's assumed to be there. I'm guessing something in between is documented in Stratum software?\r\n\r\nHere's [an example](https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool/src/73f560cf3144f824823077c1b9e1663d89823ed7/src/bitcoin.c#lines-127:135) of how it's used by pool software. There's also some documentation through bug reports, e.g. #17946. My understanding is that `!` means that it's unsafe to mine without understanding the rule.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear to me how it is intented to be used, both as an argument and in the results. I'm also not sure how to interpret this wording in BIP 145:\r\n\r\n> The '!' rule prefix MUST be enabled on the \"segwit\" rule for templates including transactions with witness data.\r\n\r\nFor 6ab119d4c1c8cf3d9c0994c22d75d016a30cdd6a I have assumed that the consumer of this RPC may care about it, so we keep `!segwit` in the result. I've the read the above sentence as referring only to the result of the RPC. With this commit it doesn't matter if you set it or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @luke-jr",

          "body": "Closes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2960\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core's JSONRPC server behaves with a special blend of 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 behaviors. This introduces compliance issues with more strict clients. There are the major misbehaviors that I found:\r\n- returning non-200 HTTP codes for RPC errors like \"Method not found\" (this is not a server error or an HTTP error)\r\n- returning both `\"error\"` and `\"result\"` fields together in a response object.\r\n- different behavior for single and batched RPC requests\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15495 added regression tests after a discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15381 to kinda lock in our RPC behavior to preserve backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12435 was an attempt to allow strict 2.0 compliance behind a flag, but was abandoned. \r\n\r\nThe approach in this PR is not strict and preserves backwards compatibility in a familiar bitcoin-y way: all old behavior is preserved, but new rules are applied to clients that opt in. One of the rules in the [JSON RPC 2.0 spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#request_object) is that the kv pair `\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\"` must be present in the request. Well, let's just use that to trigger strict 2.0 behavior! When that kv pair is included in a request object, the [response will adhere to strict JSON-RPC 2.0 rules](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object), essentially:\r\n\r\n- always return HTTP 200 \"OK\" unless there really is a server error or malformed request\r\n- either return `\"error\"` OR `\"result\"` but never both\r\n- same behavior for single and batch requests\r\n\r\nIf this is merged next steps can be:\r\n\r\n- Refactor bitcoin-cli to always use strict 2.0\r\n- Refactor the python test framework to always use strict 2.0 for everything\r\n- Begin deprecation process for 1.0/1.1 behavior (?)\r\n\r\nIf we can one day remove the old 1.0/1.1 behavior we can clean up the rpc code quite a bit.\r\n\r\nThis patch does NOT implement JSON RPC 2.0 [\"notifications\"](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#notification) which are requests that the server should not respond to.",

This is because the activation height has been completely removed from the code, rather than hard coded.\r\n\r\nSee discussion in #24737 and #26162.",

I'll unrebase and pick the test if that PR doesn't make it.\r\n\r\nI dropped 6ab119d4c1c8cf3d9c0994c22d75d016a30cdd6a: it's still necessary for the (mining software) client to tell us it supports SegWit. This is merely a checkbox now.\r\n\r\nIn the context of dropping `segwit` as a required rule I wrote:\r\n\r\n> We do the same thing with `csv`.\r\n\r\nI guess the argument here is that, unlike `segwit`, the `csv` (and `taproot`) soft fork is safe to use by a miner if they simply use the response from `getblocktemplate` without modifying it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extra `sigops`, `coinbase_reserved_sigops` and `coinbase_reserved_weight` field in the result is now tucked behind a `debug` argument.\r\n\r\nHope that addresses @luke-jr's concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the debug-only `coinbase_reserved_` arguments are just repeating a constant`*`, and the `sigops` field is straight-forward to calculate by iterating over all transactions, we can use the `debug` argument in the future to add additional stuff. Things that aid in anticipating what the next block should look like, e.g. for the [Mempool.Space](https://mempool.space) audit feature and @0xB10C's [miningpool.observer](https://miningpool.observer). For example we could expand the `transactions` result with a timestamp of when our mempool first saw it.\r\n\r\nI could however still drop the fields from 09fbc4cbfa7b7d86e6da00a737317151088b4b6c and ac3fcb240af8ef96d4e348548995ec1a536ff531, but keep the `Assume`.\r\n\r\n`*` = given that F2pool shot itself in the foot with custom patches, trying to squeeze out a few more sigops in their blocks, maybe we should make this configurable.",
