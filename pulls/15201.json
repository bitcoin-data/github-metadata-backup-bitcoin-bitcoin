Lock cs_vNodes before reading the variable vNodes.\r\n//\r\n// When removing NO_THREAD_SAFETY_ANALYSIS be aware of the following lock order requirements:\r\n// * CheckForStaleTipAndEvictPeers locks cs_main before indirectly calling GetExtraOutboundCount\r\n//   which locks cs_vNodes.\r\n// * ProcessMessage locks cs_main and g_cs_orphans before indirectly calling ForEachNode which\r\n//   locks cs_vNodes.\r\n//\r\n// Thus the implicit locking order requirement is: (1) cs_main, (2) g_cs_orphans, (3) cs_vNodes.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that `cs_vNodes` needs to be locked before reading the variable `vNodes`.\r\n\r\nAdding such a lock in `CConnman::Stop` would be trivial, but we have to take into account the implicit locking order requirements that follow from other parts of the code. Getting a matching locking order here results in surprisingly invasive changes (at least when I did it!).",
