Fixes all known (to me) build issues except the boost issue mentioned below, tested with several compilers/stdlibs.\n- Fix a boost incompatibility with c++11 and list_of\n- Don't forward-declare std::map types. See: http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=13471\n- Watch out for user-defined-literal syntax in tests\n\nThere's also an annoying boost bug that causes problems with copy_file on some platforms:\nhttps://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/10038\n\nIt's a bit more complicated to fix, so I'm leaving that as a separate issue. Ideally we could work around it by just using a different function. As a temporary workaround, adding BOOST_NO_SCOPED_ENUMS to CPPFLAGS works.\n\nAs mentioned in a commit message, the MOVEONLY commits are very simple despite what the nasty git diffs show, it's just moved code.\n",
