    "body": "[BIP 331](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0331.mediawiki) implements receiver-initiated package relay, where receivers can request missing information about packages. However, this requires excessive round trips. If the sender knows that it is giving the receiver a transaction for which it doesn't have the ancestors, it should be able to just send a package (containing the transaction and the unknown ancestor(s)) instead. \r\n\r\nThis PR could potentially reduce some bandwidth, and could also reduce the number of transactions in the orphanage. However, if a node is sending packages that the receiver already knows about, this could increase significant bandwidth. As a result, this PR needs more testing. I did some initial testing between two nodes with `sendpackages` enabled, and it showed that no redundant packages were sent, which indicates that this may be a useful feature. \r\n\r\nThis PR implements the following:\r\n- signaling support for `sendpackages` and the corresponding negotiation logic\r\n- a node will send a `pkgtxns` message to the receiver node if the ancestor of a transaction that has been requested is not in the receiver node's `m_tx_inventory_known_filter`\r\n- nodes can process `pkgtxns` messages\r\n- the maximum number of transactions that can be sent through sender-initialized package relay has been set to 2, although this can be changed in the future\r\n- adds logging, functional tests, and fuzzing (for `ReceivedPackage`)\r\n\r\nThank you to glozow for her help with this PR!
