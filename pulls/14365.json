By making the contributor aware of newly introduced unused code it gives him/her an opportunity to investigate if the unused code they introduce is malignant or benign :-)\r\n* Unused code is hard to spot for humans and is thus often missed during manual review\r\n* [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)\r\n\r\nBased on #14312 to make linter job pass.",
