    "body": "Introducing the `ScriptPubKeyMan` (short for ScriptPubKeyManager) for managing scriptPubKeys and their associated scripts and keys. This functionality is moved over from `CWallet`. Instead, `CWallet` will have a pointer to a `ScriptPubKeyMan` for every possible address type, internal and external. It will fetch the correct `ScriptPubKeyMan` as necessary. When fetching new addresses, it chooses the `ScriptPubKeyMan` based on address type and whether it is change. For signing, it takes the script and asks each `ScriptPubKeyMan` for whether that `ScriptPubKeyMan` considers that script `IsMine`, whether it has that script, or whether it is able to produce a signature for it. If so, the `ScriptPubKeyMan` will provide a `SigningProvider` to the caller which will use that in order to sign.\r\n\r\nThere is currently one `ScriptPubKeyMan` - the `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`. Each `CWallet` will have only one `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` with the pointers for all of the address types and change pointing to this `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`. It is created when the wallet is loaded and all keys and metadata are loaded into it instead of `CWallet`. The `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` is primarily made up of all of the key and script management that used to be in `CWallet`. For convenience, `CWallet` has a `GetLegacyScriptPubKeyMan` which will return the `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` or a `nullptr` if it does not have one (not yet implemented, but callers will check for the `nullptr`). For purposes of signing, `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`'s `GetSigningProvider` will return itself rather than a separate `SigningProvider`. This will be different for future `ScriptPubKeyMan`s.\r\n\r\nThe `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` will also handle the importing and exporting of keys and scripts instead of `CWallet`. As such, a number of RPCs have been limited to work only if a `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` can be retrieved from the wallet. These RPCs are `sethdseed`, `addmultisigaddress`, `importaddress`, `importprivkey`, `importpubkey`, `importmulti`, `dumpprivkey`, and `dumpwallet`. Other RPCs which relied on the wallet for scripts and keys have been modified in order to take the `SigningProvider` retrieved from the `ScriptPubKeyMan` for a given script.\r\n\r\nOverall, these changes should not effect how everything actually works and the user should experience no difference between having this change and not having it. As such, no functional tests were changed, and the only unit tests changed were those that were directly accessing `CWallet` functions that have been removed.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the last step in the [Wallet Structure Changes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Wallet-Class-Structure-Changes).\r\n\r\nThe commits are organized as follows:\r\n* Miscellaneous changes that don't necessarily make sense outside of this PR\r\n  * Move wallet enums to walletutil.h\r\n  * List output types in an array in order to be iterated over\r\n  * Always try to sign for all pubkeys in multisig\r\n* Interface definitions and miscellaneous changes in preparation for `ScriptPubKeyMan` integration\r\n  * Introduce both ScriptPubKeyMan as an interface and LegacyScriptPubKeyMan as a dummy class\r\n  * Add LegacyScriptPubKeyMan to CWallet\r\n  * Add function callbacks for wallet flags and versions and wallet database\r\n  * Fetch the SigningProvider for a script from the wallet\r\n  * Fetch the ScriptPubKeyMan for given output type and internal-ness, or a given script, or ScriptPubKeyMan id\r\n* Implementation of `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` by copying existing code from `CWallet`. These will pass all tests and do not affect `CWallet`\r\n  * Implement GetSigningProvider in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement function to connect ScriptPubKeyMan's NotifyCanGetAddessesChanged and NotifyWatchOnlyChanged to CWallet's\r\n  * Implement IsLocked and IsCrypted in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement LoadCryptedKey and AddCryptedKey in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement UpdateTimeFirstKey, and GetTimeFirstKey in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement AddWatchOnly, RemoveWatchOnly, HaveWatchOnly, and LoadWatchOnly in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement AddKeyPubKey and LoadKey in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement WalletLogPrintf in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement SetHDCHain, and IsHDEnabled in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement LoadCScript in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement LoadKeyMetadata and LoadScriptMetadata in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement GetKey, HaveKey, and GetPubKey in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement GenerateNewKey in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement LoadKeyPool in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement GetOldestKeyPoolTime, KeypoolCountExternalKeys, and GetKeypoolSize in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement CanGetAddresses, CanGenerateKeys, and HavePrivateKeys in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement GenerateNewSeed, DeriveNewSeed, and SetHDSeed for LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement TopUpKeypool, TopUp, and NewKeyPool in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement ReturnAddress, and KeepKey in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement GetNewAddress, and GetReservedAddress in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement MarkUnusedAddresses in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement IsMine in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement UpgradeKeyMetaData, SetupGeneration, IsFirstRun, Upgrade, RewriteDB in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement Unlock, Lock, and Encrypt and LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement ImporScripts, ImportPrivKeys, ImportPubKeys, and ImportScriptPubKeys in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement GetMetadata in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement GetKeyOrigin in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement actually loading everything into LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * Implement CanProvide in LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n* Replacing `CWallet` functions and RPC things with calls to `ScriptPubKeyMan` or `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`. These will compile but are not expected to pass tests hence the `[ci skip]`.\r\n  * [ci skip] Remove CWallet from IsMine and have CWallet always use ScriptPubKeyMan's IsMine\r\n  * [ci skip] moveonly: move ismine stuff to be a module of LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * [ci skip] Have GetNewAddress, GetNewChangeAddress, and ReserveAddress use ScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * [ci skip] Mark used addresses in ScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * [ci skip] Call UpgradeKeyMetaData for each ScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * [ci skip] Sign using SigningProvider from ScriptPubKeyMan when signing within CWallet\r\n  * [ci skip] Do not allow import*, dump*, and addmultisigaddress RPCs when wallet is not backed by LegacyScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * [ci skip] Change Imports to use LegacyScriptPubKeyMan Imports\r\n  * [ci skip] Use SigningProviders and ScriptPubKeyMans in listunspent, signmessage, signrawtransactionwithwallet, and getaddressinfo\r\n  * [ci skip] Use LegacyScriptPubKeyMan in addmultisigaddress and sethdseed\r\n  * [ci skip] Use LegacyScriptPubKeyMan for hdseedid in getwalletinfo\r\n  * [ci skip] Change KeypoolCountExternal and GetKeypoolSize to get aggregate sizes from ScriptPubKeyMans\r\n  * [ci skip] Have IsHDEnabled fetch from ScriptPubKeyMans\r\n  * [ci skip] Fetch oldest keypool time from ScriptPubKeyMans\r\n  * [ci skip] have TopUpKeyPool call TopUp in each ScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * [ci skip] Have EncryptWallet, Lock, and Unlock call their respective functions in ScriptPubKeyMans\r\n  * [ci skip] Use LegacyScriptPubKeyMan throughout psbt_wallet_tests\r\n  * [ci skip] Use LegacyScriptPubKeyMan throughout wallettool\r\n  * [ci skip] Use ScriptPubKeyMans' Setup and Upgrade functions when loading or creating a wallet\r\n  * [ci skip] Define first run as having no ScriptPubKeyMans\r\n  * [ci skip] Use RewriteDB action when DB needs rewrite\r\n  * [ci skip] Use GetTimeFirstKey instead of nTimeFirstKey\r\n  * [ci skip] Use LegacyScriptPubKeyMan for in wallet_tests\r\n  * [ci skip] Use LegacyScriptPubKeyMan in dumpprivkey and dumpwallet\r\n  * [ci skip] Change CanGetAddresses to fetch from ScriptPubKeyMan\r\n  * [ci skip] Fetch the correct SigningProvider for signing PSBTs\r\n  * [ci skip] Use LegacyScriptPubKeyMan in test util\r\n  * [ci skip] Use LegacyScriptPubKeyMan in some parts of getbalances and createwallet\r\n  * [ci skip] Have getPubKey and getPrivKey use SigningProvider\r\n  * [ci skip] Use LegacyScriptPubKeyMan in benchmarks involving the wallet\r\n  * [ci skip] Store p2sh scripts in AddAndGetDestinationForScript\r\n* Tying everything together and removing the `CWallet` functions.\r\n  * Remove unused functions and switch CWallet to use ScriptPubKeyMan",

      "body": "Approach ACK.\r\n\r\nTo make some of the commits easier to review, instead of having one commit that adds a function to `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` (e.g. `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::LoadKey`), one commit that deletes it from CWallet (`Remove unused functions and switch CWallet to use ScriptPubKeyMan`) and one commit that moves the call over (`Implement actually loading everything into LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`), try to combine those. That lets you get rid of the CI Skip commits, and makes it easier to verify move-only parts with `--color-moved=dimmed-zebra`.\r\n\r\nIn other words, start with empty `(Legacy)ScriptPubKeyMan` and then migrate one function per commit into it.\r\n\r\nAre you sure you want to move `WalletFeature` and `WalletFlags` into `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`? I would prefer to keep these settings global to the wallet. It does make sense for each `ScriptPubKeyMan` to have its own `IsLocked()` state, so that brings up the question what to do if a single one fails to unlock. But I'd rather not add RPC methods to unlock specific `PubKeyMan`s in a given wallet.\r\n\r\nI brainstormed how to apply this to hardware wallets: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14912#issuecomment-510520757. The unsollicited keypool topup in `GetReservedDestination` is annoying in that context. Can `ScriptPubKeyMan` have a flag to opt out of that? ",

      "body": "> To make some of the commits easier to review, instead of having one commit that adds a function to `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` (e.g. `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::LoadKey`), one commit that deletes it from CWallet (`Remove unused functions and switch CWallet to use ScriptPubKeyMan`) and one commit that moves the call over (`Implement actually loading everything into LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`), try to combine those. That lets you get rid of the CI Skip commits, and makes it easier to verify move-only parts with `--color-moved=dimmed-zebra`.\r\n> \r\n> In other words, start with empty `(Legacy)ScriptPubKeyMan` and then migrate one function per commit into it.\r\n\r\nDoing that will cause the entirety of the PR to fail all tests (so all need ci skip) except for the very last commit. If other reviewers want that, I could reorganize it.\r\n\r\n> Are you sure you want to move `WalletFeature` and `WalletFlags` into `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`? I would prefer to keep these settings global to the wallet.\r\n\r\nThey are global to the wallet. They are moved to `walletutil.h`. Both `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` and `CWallet` require access to both of these enums, but having `scriptpubkeyman` including `wallet.h` would be a circular dependency, so I moved it to `walletutil.h`.\r\n\r\n> It does make sense for each `ScriptPubKeyMan` to have its own `IsLocked()` state, so that brings up the question what to do if a single one fails to unlock.\r\n\r\nI guess it should fail to unlock everything? That would indicate some corruption has occurred.\r\n\r\n> But I'd rather not add RPC methods to unlock specific `PubKeyMan`s in a given wallet.\r\n\r\nAgreed.\r\n\r\n> The unsollicited keypool topup in `GetReservedDestination` is annoying in that context. Can `ScriptPubKeyMan` have a flag to opt out of that?\\\r\n\r\nI suppose it should actually be in `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::GetReservedDestination` rather than `CWallet`'s. However, `TopUp` can just do nothing and that won't effect this behavior. Every `ScriptPubKeyMan` needs to implement `TopUp` anyways.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Started review (will update list below with progress). Heroic effort here by achow! I've started to review a few times, but put it off for too long. Time to seriously jump in.\r\n\r\nMy initial impression here is in line with Sjors, that it would have been wiser to have sequence of commits gradually moving bits of code and bits of data with all tests passing at every commit, rather than a sequence of commits copying then a sequence of commits deleting. Moving is nicer than copying for review, because you can see the original code right in the diff instead of having to search for it manually. But I know there was an earlier attempt at this, and it didn't go well for whatever reason, and I don't think it's worth putting in more effort just to restructure the PR.\r\n\r\n- [X]

The refactors touch very different spots, so could be multiple PRs. At minimum I would put the pure refactors and new ScriptPubKeyman stuff separate PRs. Right now the commits alternate between refactors and adding new stuff.\r\n* d9ea84699fc0c63003b759ec8e41802a3e1a2cec `Always try to sign for all pubkeys in multisig` (haven't reviewed yet)\r\n* cce926c57 `Refactor rawtransaction_util's SignTransaction` code review ACK\r\n* d2d43ab141e7f27b3c965ebbf5e7db10476837f3 `Move wallet enums to walletutil.h` ACK, confirmed move only\r\n\r\nIn general I suggest splitting as much as possible out into followup, prerequisite and parallel PRs. Then let's see if we can review the remaining blob as a whole, or keep chipping small bits off. \r\n\r\nJust make sure to add all these PRs to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/12; I find that work flow pretty efficient in the assume UTXO protect https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/11",

Nice work on this @achow101 and thank you for being so responsive to suggestions!\r\n\r\nTo review this, I created my own branch [`pr/keyman`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/keyman) with the same end result as this PR but with a different commit structure that made more sense to me. You could consider adopting this branch if you think it'd be easier for others to review. The branch consists of a pure moveonly commit followed by a renaming commit followed by smaller refactoring and bugfix commits. Unlike the current PR, moved code is never added in one commit and deleted in a separate commit, and every commit compiles and passes tests, and refactoring changes are in different commits than bugfix changes. It's possible the branch might be helpful to other reviewers even if not adopted, and in any case I'm happy with the PR in its current form.\r\n\r\n|

You can use `--enable-debug` again as of 8aa21da (`Refactor: Move encryption code between KeyMan and Wallet`).\r\n* I don't have strong feelings about the last couple \"Unclear if this change is necessary or useful\" commits. \r\n\r\nWould be nice to get one final rebase of #16528, to do some testing with descriptor wallets.",

It is sufficient to just check `HasEncryptionKeys` because having any encryption keys is a better indicator of encryption. So I've removed `HasEncryptedData` and the things that called it now call `HasEncryptedData`.\r\n\r\nThis also avoids some issues with locking and recursion from calling `IsLocked`.",

      "body": "Apologies to @achow101 because the work here is great and very promising, but I want to remove my ACK from this PR. With Sjors and Instagibbs ACKs coming so quickly after mine, it seems possible my review might be being given more weight than it warrants, and I want to avoid this possibility.\r\n\r\nNormally when I ACK something I want to at least be able to say \"I'd be surprised if this PR introduced a bug\", but with [all the changes broken out](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/keyman), and several I haven't deeply looked into, I might be more surprised if this PR didn't introduce any bugs than if it did.\r\n\r\nI think it'd be fine to merge this PR with reviews and ACKs from other people. And personally I'd feel comfortable adding my ACK to smaller, more broken down PRs. But just given size of this PR, the time I've spent on it, and my level of understanding, I don't think my review should count for that much and I want to make sure this change gets in depth review and more confident ACKs from other people if it will be merged.",

But I agree this PR needs more people looking at it. Lots of moving parts. More tests would also be useful, because a lot of things can be changed without breaking any.\r\n\r\n@meshcollider mentioned on IRC he's also in the process of reviewing. \r\n\r\nConfirming that e418a29 is a rebase of my previous ACK, but I haven't re-tested it. It takes into account the new bech32 default, the new watch-only tests added in #16786 and adds a bunch of comments.",

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

      "body": "The state variables vMasterKey, fUseCrypto, and fDecryptionThoroughlyChecked seem to end up duplicated in both the CWallet and in KeyMan classes:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fb0058ed68a18053959001a0191f3fbcfec50526/src/wallet/wallet.h#L591\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fb0058ed68a18053959001a0191f3fbcfec50526/src/wallet/scriptpubkeyman.h#L246\r\n\r\nIs this by design, or could KeyMan instances store references or pointers instead? It seems not ideal for different KeyMan instances to potentially be storing their own copies of encryption state and maybe having variables like fDecryptionThoroughlyChecked set inconsistently.\r\n\r\nAlso, the SetCrypted and IsLocked functions are duplicated almost but not quite verbatim across both classes:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fb0058ed68a18053959001a0191f3fbcfec50526/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L3996-L4012\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fb0058ed68a18053959001a0191f3fbcfec50526/src/wallet/scriptpubkeyman.cpp#L213-L231\r\n\r\nI don't know if any of this is harmful, but it does seem more messy than it needs to be. What would you think about introducing an interface like: \r\n\r\n```c++\r\nclass WalletStorage\r\n{\r\n    virtual ~WalletStorage() = default;\r\n    virtual const std::string& GetDisplayName() = 0;\r\n    virtual WalletDatabase& GetDatabase() = 0;\r\n    virtual const CKeyingMaterial& GetMasterKey() = 0;\r\n    virtual void IsWalletFlagSet(uint64_t)> = 0;\r\n    virtual void SetWalletFlag(WalletBatch&, uint64_t)> = 0;\r\n    virtual bool UnsetWalletFlagWithDB(uint64_t) = 0;\r\n    virtual bool CanSupportFeature(enum WalletFeature) = 0;\r\n    virtual void SetMinVersion(enum WalletFeature) = 0;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat would allow ScriptPubKeyMan to get access to database and crypto functionality without creating a circular dependency on CWallet, and without needing the current std::function trampolines and duplication of crypto code.\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to declare this interface in scriptpubkeyman.h or a standalone header, pass it to scriptpubkeymanager instances, and have CWallet inherit and implement it.",

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

      "body": "I've added `WalletStorage` as you suggested. However I did not change `vMasterKey`, `fUseCrypto`, and `fDecryptionThorouglyChecked` to be references or pointers as allowing `ScriptPubKeyMan`s to modify these variables in `CWallet` itself may result in inconsistent states where one `ScriptPubKeyMan` has finished en/decrypting but another has not. Properly changing them to use references could be done in the future, but doing it now would cause the places that use them to differ even more and thus make review harder.",

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

It doesn't seem like we'd ever want `KeyMan` instances to outlive their `CWallet` instance, or to be shared between multiple `CWallet` instances. So wouldn't it be simplest to store `KeyMan` instances in `CWallet` `unique_ptr<>` or `set<unique_ptr<>>` member variables so they get cleaned up when the wallet does, but otherwise just use plain `&` references or `*` pointers everywhere else (address types maps, accessors, and higher level code)?",

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

I think it is equivalent because the `LoadWallet(*this)` call above will only call `GetLegacyScriptPubKeyMan()` internally if keys are found, and if it does not, `SetupLegacyScriptPubKeyMan()` will not have been called yet and  `m_spk_managers` will be empty. But correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nI guess it's a little confusing that `GetLegacyScriptPubKeyMan` right now will actually create a legacy keyman if one doesn't exist, and never return null, even though there are checks for it returning null throughout the code. Maybe there should be two different methods for clarity:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nLegacyScriptPubKeyMan* GetLegacyScriptPubKeyMan();\r\nLegacyScriptPubKeyMan& GetOrCreateLegacyScriptPubKeyMan();\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust a suggestion, though, and correct me if I missed anything.",

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool.

      "body": "The encryption stuff here is making my head spin. Wallet encryption was already confusing before, but now with CWallet and ScriptPubKeyMan both having duplicate `fUseCrypto`, `SetCrypted()`, `IsCrypted()`,  `vMasterKey`, `IsLocked()` states and code, it's hard to tell which combinations of state are expected, and which are bugs, and whether the code supposed to be keeping states in sync actually works.\r\n\r\nI have a few suggestions to try clarify things. These should also simplify the code.\r\n\r\n1. Drop the `CWallet::fUseCrypto` member and `CWallet::SetCrypted()` method. Change `CWallet::IsCrypted()` method to just loop over keyman objects and call IsCrypted on them. As far as I can tell the `CWallet::fUseCrypto` state is broken in the current PR. `CWallet::SetCrypted()` used to be called whenever any encrypted data was present, but now that now longer happens, and `CWallet::IsCrypted()` returns false if the wallet hasn't been explicitly encrypted or locked since startup, regardless of what encrypted keys or data are present.\r\n\r\n2. If the intent is to consider a wallet encrypted \"by virtue of having an encryption key set\", it'd be better to add a new method `bool HasEncryptionKey() { return !mapCryptedKeys.empty(); }` instead of overloading `IsCrypted()`. It might also make sense to rename the existing `IsCrypted()` function `HasEncryptedData()` in that case so the meaning is not confused.\r\n\r\n3. This last suggestion is less important, but I think it'd be better to lock and unlock the entire wallet, instead of parts of it. The keyman `vMasterKey` member and `IsLocked()`, `Locked()`, and `Unlocked()` implementations copied from wallet code could all be dropped. Keyman instances should have a `fDecryptionThoroughlyChecked` member and have `CheckDecryption()` methods, but otherwise would be simpler if they just called `IsLocked()` and `GetMasterKey()` from `WalletStorage` instead of implementing locking and unlocking themselves.",

IIUC this gets the timestamp from keypool entry at index 0. For legacy wallets those are the same, so `std::max` is fine.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index).

In that situation, `mapCryptedKeys` will be empty because no keys have been loaded into memory.\r\n\r\nI think since you removed the `SetCrypted` call at the beginning of  `CWallet::Lock`, the `fUseCrypto` variable no longer contains any useful information (it's just a stale sometimes out-of-date cache of `!mapCryptedKeys.empty()`), and that's why HasEncryptedData now has to take a lock and return `fUseCrypto || !mapCryptedKeys.empty()` instead of just the previous `fUseCrypto`.\r\n\r\nIf you got rid of the `fUseCrypto` variable and the `SetCrypted()` method as described https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16341#discussion_r328786049, I think it would be equivalent to the current code and more comprehensible.",

The two `if(!SetCrypted()) return false` lines would just be replaced by `if (!mapKeys.empty()) return false`",

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index).

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index).

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

But it also seems like it should not be able to make any difference because the CanGetAddresses call above would return false if private keys were disabled.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest either dropping this condition or adding an explanatory comment. Tests do seem to pass if this is dropped.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure if the CanGetAddresses check added above is more than just a sanity check, but if it is actually an expected condition, it'd be useful to have a comment saying when it's expected to trigger. It seems like a fine check, but it's not clear what the motivation was for adding it. Tests do seem to pass without it.",

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c).

I also noticed TopUp calls were removed in `GetNewChangeDestination` and `CreateWalletFromFile`, and I don't know why.\r\n\r\nThese changes seem ok, but I guess the things I'd like to know would be:\r\n\r\n1. If something in particular motivated these changes, or if they just seemed like a good ideas.\r\n2. In general, if there's some kind of reasoning about where the keypool should be topped up. For example, I'd expect either keyman objects to be responible for topping up internally, or for the wallet to be responsible, but not for calls to happen both places. If there is intent behind this, maybe the Topup method could have a comment saying when it's supposed to be called.\r\n\r\nCould also consider reverting top up changes that aren't necessary here. I think I'll be done with my neverending review of this PR soon, but little changes like this I don't understand do not make the end seem closer!  :smiley:",

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index).

This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index). The CKeyPool object is used to\n+ * serialize/deserialize the pool data to/from the database.\n+ */\n+class CKeyPool\n+{\n+public:\n+    //! The time at which the key was generated.

These\n+ * are sets of keys that have not yet been used to provide addresses or receive\n+ * change.\n+ *\n+ * The Bitcoin Core wallet was originally a collection of unrelated private\n+ * keys with their associated addresses. If a non-HD wallet generated a\n+ * key/address, gave that address out and then restored a backup from before\n+ * that key's generation, then any funds sent to that address would be\n+ * lost definitively.\n+ *\n+ * The keypool was implemented to avoid this scenario (commit: 10384941). The\n+ * wallet would generate a set of keys (100 by default). When a new public key\n+ * was required, either to give out as an address or to use in a change output,\n+ * it would be drawn from the keypool. The keypool would then be topped up to\n+ * maintain 100 keys. This ensured that as long as the wallet hadn't used more\n+ * than 100 keys since the previous backup, all funds would be safe, since a\n+ * restored wallet would be able to scan for all owned addresses.\n+ *\n+ * A keypool also allowed encrypted wallets to give out addresses without\n+ * having to be decrypted to generate a new private key.\n+ *\n+ * With the introduction of HD wallets (commit: f1902510), the keypool\n+ * essentially became an address look-ahead pool. Restoring old backups can no\n+ * longer definitively lose funds as long as the addresses used were from the\n+ * wallet's HD seed (since all private keys can be rederived from the seed).\n+ * However, if many addresses were used since the backup, then the wallet may\n+ * not know how far ahead in the HD chain to look for its addresses. The\n+ * keypool is used to implement a 'gap limit'. The keypool maintains a set of\n+ * keys (by default 1000) ahead of the last used key and scans for the\n+ * addresses of those keys.  This avoids the risk of not seeing transactions\n+ * involving the wallet's addresses, or of re-using the same address.\n+ *\n+ * The HD-split wallet feature added a second keypool (commit: 02592f4c). There\n+ * is an external keypool (for addresses to hand out) and an internal keypool\n+ * (for change addresses).\n+ *\n+ * Keypool keys are stored in the wallet/keystore's keymap. The keypool data is\n+ * stored as sets of indexes in the wallet (setInternalKeyPool,\n+ * setExternalKeyPool and set_pre_split_keypool), and a map from the key to the\n+ * index (m_pool_key_to_index).

As far as I know, key managers will continue to need a way to read and store data in the wallet database, and `WalletStorage` provides a limited and controlled interface for doing that. \r\n\r\nEven if the wallet storage interface is going to be eliminated or cut back at some point, having wrapper functions that imply a key manager is storing its own data now when it isn't muddles the code and adds pointless hops in the meantime.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is an important issue at all. Just surprised if getting rid of the indirection here wouldn't be the obvious choice.",
