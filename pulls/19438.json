    "body": "Introduces helper functions to make it easy to bury future deployments, along the lines of the suggestion from [11398](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11398#issuecomment-335599326) \"I would prefer it if a buried deployment wouldn't require all code paths that check the BIP9 status to require changing\".\r\n\r\nThis provides three functions: `DeploymentEnabled()` which tests if a deployment can ever be active, `DeploymentActiveAt()` which checks if a deployment should be enforced in the given block, and `DeploymentActiveAfter()` which checks if a deployment should be enforced in the block following the given block, and overloads all three to work both with buried deployments and versionbits deployments.\r\n\r\nThis adds a dedicated lock for the versionbits cache, which is acquired internally by the versionbits functions, rather than relying on `cs_main`. It also moves moves versionbitscache into deploymentstatus to avoid a circular dependency with validation.",

If you're implying the `ComputeBlockVersion` to `versionbits.ComputeBlockVersion` change is a bit ugly, that could be fixed just by adding an `inline int32_t ComputeBlockVersion(pindexPrev, params) { return versionbits.ComputeBlockVersion(pindexPrev, params); }` in deploymentstatus.h (where the `versionbits` global is declared).",

The benefit is not exposing anything about the internal implementation outside of the .cpp file.\r\n\r\n> I think minimising the number of globals and keeping the lock and the things the lock is guarding together (which then allows stronger locking assertions [...]\r\n\r\nI think it's fine to have a global with internal linkage in a single implementation file. The problems with globals all come when they're externally linked and accessed from many places in the code. The point about locking assertions also isn't relevant here since we're not using `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(!) ` or `LOCKS_EXCLUDED()` for this mutex.",

Having looked at it again, I think the only thing that would really end up making awkward is the rpc/blockchain.cpp stuff (ie, it would mean templating the `SoftForkPushBack` function and having the compiler duplicate the code and possibly not de-duplicate it when optimising) but that's not necessarily a big deal.\r\n\r\nI've added a draft commit that switches to templated functions and static_asserts to see what that's like. It does make rpc/blockchain a bit bigger (after compiling with clang) so might need be worth some tweaking to avoid that, and the syntax is a bit clunky, but it seems plausible. Thoughts?",
