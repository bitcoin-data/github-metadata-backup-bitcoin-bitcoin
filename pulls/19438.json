    "body": "Introduces helper functions to make it easy to bury future deployments, along the lines of the suggestion from [11398](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11398#issuecomment-335599326) \"I would prefer it if a buried deployment wouldn't require all code paths that check the BIP9 status to require changing\".\r\n\r\nThis provides three functions: `DeploymentEnabled()` which tests if a deployment can ever be active, `DeploymentActiveAt()` which checks if a deployment should be enforced in the given block, and `DeploymentActiveAfter()` which checks if a deployment should be enforced in the block following the given block, and overloads all three to work both with buried deployments and versionbits deployments.\r\n\r\nThis adds a dedicated lock for the versionbits cache, which is acquired internally by the versionbits functions, rather than relying on `cs_main`. It also moves moves versionbitscache into deploymentstatus to avoid a circular dependency with validation.",

This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Original change description\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with assumeutxo, here's a brief summary from [the issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15605) (where any conceptual discussion not specific to this implementation should happen):\r\n\r\n> assumeutxo would be a way to initialize a node using a headers chain and a serialized version of the UTXO state which was generated from another node at some block height. A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n> \r\n> This would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly (and with less disk usage) than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip. Needless to say this is at expense of accepting a different trust model, though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nIn short, this is an interesting change because it would allow nodes to get up and running within minutes given a ~3GB file (at time of writing) under an almost identical trust model to assumevalid.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I add a few RPC commands: `dumptxoutset` creates a UTXO snapshot and writes it to disk, and `loadtxoutset` intakes a snapshot from disk, constructs and activates chainstate based on it, and continues a from-scratch initial block download in the background for the sole purpose of validating the snapshot. Once the snapshot is validated, we throw away the chainstate used for background validation.\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo procedure as implemented is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A UTXO snapshot is loaded with the `loadtxoutset <path>` RPC command.\r\n1. A new chainstate (`CChainState`) is initialized using `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`:\r\n   1. The serialized UTXO data is read in and various sanity checks are performed, e.g. compare expected coin count, recompute the hash and compare it with assumeutxo hash in source code.\r\n   1. We \"fast forward\" `new_chainstate->m_chain` to have a tip at the base of the snapshot (with or without block data). Lacking block data, we fake the `nTx` counts of the constituent `CBlockIndex` entries.\r\n   1. `LoadChainTip()` is called on the new snapshot and it is installed as our active chainstate.\r\n1. The new assumed-valid chainstate is now our active, and so that enters IBD until it is synced to the network's tip. Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n1. Once the active chainstate is out of IBD, our old validation chain continues IBD \"in the background\" while the active chainstate services requests from most of the system.\r\n1. Once the background validation chainstate reaches a height equal the base of the snapshot, we take the hash of its UTXO set and ensure it equals the expected hash based on the snapshot. If the hashes are equivalent, we delete the validation chainstate and move on without event; if they aren't, we log loudly and fall back to the validation chainstate (we should probably just shut down).\r\n\r\nThe implicit assumption is that the background validation chain will always be a subset of the assumed-valid snapshot chain while the latter is active. We don't properly handle reorgs that go deeper than the base of the snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Changes (already merged/outdated)\r\n\r\n![chainstate-beforeafter (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/54435797-a16b0780-4707-11e9-89c3-c90b5686804d.png)\r\n \r\nThe crux of this change is in removing any assumptions in the codebase that there is a single chainstate, i.e. any references to global variables `chainActive`, `pcoinsTip`, et al. need to be replaced with functions that return the relevant chainstate data at that moment in time. This change also takes `CChainState` to its logical conclusion by making it more self-contained - any references to globals like `chainActive` are removed with class-local references (`m_chain`).\r\n\r\nA few minor notes on the implementation:\r\n\r\n- When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\n- For additional notes, see [the new assumeutxo docs](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/blob/utxo-dumpload-compressed/doc/assumeutxo.md).",

          "body": "Currently we use an `unordered_map<uint256, CBlockIndex*>` for our BlockMap. This is a bit of a peculiar choice because we then store a pointer to the uint256 from the pair inside of the CBlockIndex. It would be conceptually simpler if we used a `unordered_map<CBlockIndex>` and modified `CBlockIndex` to directly own the uint256 for the phashBlock.\r\n\r\nThat's what this patch attempts doing. The only additional complexity is where we do want to query the map by key, the key equivalence stuff is only in C++20, so we add a helper that lets us construct a mock element easily for using with find.\r\n\r\nThe result is nicer since we get rid of an additional indirection for accessing the phashblock and we get rid of a lot of std::pair de-structuring. We also save a bit of memory per index (I haven't computed it precisely, but my guess is we save something like 24 bytes total per index by eliminating 1 pointer, which saves 8 bytes, and then could save us something like 16 bytes of padding). We also no longer can be in an inconsistent state where phashblock does not point to the entries own hash (although modifying phashblock once it is inserted into the map would be invalid -- it must be removed, modified, and reinserted).\r\n\r\nFuture work can likely further improve on this by making CBlockIndex owned* by the unordered_set directly, which will eliminate even more indirection/pointer chasing and make a lot of the code using BlockMap simpler (I don't think we ever rely on CBlockIndex being non-owned anywhere, nor should we have reason to in the future).\r\n\r\n\r\n* see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_set, it will still be safe to use pointers for e.g., pprev.\r\n```\r\n     References and pointers to data stored in the container are only invalidated by erasing that element, even when the corresponding iterator is invalidated. \r\n```",

Only subcommand currently is \"grind\" which takes a hex-encoded header and grinds its nonce until its nBits is satisfied.\r\n\r\nUpdates `getblocktemplate` to include `signet_challenge` field, and makes `getblocktemplate` require the signet rule when invoked on the signet change. Removes connectivity and IBD checks from `getblocktemplate` when applied to a test chain (regtest, testnet, signet).",

          "body": "Picked up from #15810. Add separate fee-checking logic for clients that need to enforce max fee rates, then remove the `absurdFee` logic from ATMP.\r\n\r\nATMP's `nAbsurdFee` argument is used to enforce user-specific behavior (it is not policy since it isn't applied consistently: it is only ever used in RPC and wallet, and set to 0 everywhere else internally). It should be removed from `AcceptToMemoryPool` because (1) validation results/mempool behavior should not be user-specific and (2) enforcing a max fee rate should be the responsibility of the client instead of the mempool.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR does not intend to _remove_ protection from high fees, just re-delegate the responsibility to clients.",

          "body": "I'm opening this PR to give a convenient way to see the history #19953 goes through, as review comments get addressed.\r\n\r\nThe intent is to only add commits here, and use merge commit when the real PR undergoes a rebase.\r\n\r\nIt is marked draft as this branch isn't expected to be merged.\r\n\r\n<sub>`PREV=\"$(git rev-parse HEAD)\"; git log --oneline upstream/master..HEAD | while read C L; do if [ \"d${L:0:14}\" == \"d--- [TAPROOT] \" ]; then if [ \"d$PREV\" != \"\" ]; then git diff --shortstat $C..$PREV | (read _ _ _ ADD _ DEL _; echo \"### ${L:14:-4} (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/$C...$PREV) [+$ADD -$DEL]:\"); echo; fi; PREV=$C; PREVL=$L; else echo -n \" * $C **${L}**: \"; git show \"$C\" --format=\"%b\" -s | awk '/^$/{exit} 1' | tr $'\\n' ' '; echo; fi; done | tac`</sub>\r\n\r\n### Initial version (2020-09-20) [+2730 -118]\r\n\r\n * 0daa3708e2 **scripted-diff: put ECDSA in name of signature functions**: In preparation for adding Schnorr versions of `CheckSig`, `VerifySignature`, and `ComputeEntry`, give them an ECDSA specific name. \r\n * 135f12ad38 **refactor: rename scriptPubKey in VerifyWitnessProgram to exec_script**: The old name is confusing, as it doesn't store a scriptPubKey, but the actually executed script. \r\n * f4d16cf644 **refactor: keep spent outputs in PrecomputedTransactionData**: A BIP-341 signature message may commit to the scriptPubKeys and amounts of all spent outputs (including other ones than the input being signed for spends), so keep them available to signature hashing code. \r\n * 60ce12334f **Add TaggedHash function (BIP 340)**: This adds the TaggedHash function as defined by BIP340 to the hash module, which is used in BIP340 and BIP341 to produce domain-separated hashes. \r\n * 34da219826 **Implement Taproot signature hashing (BIP 341)**: This implements the new sighashing scheme from BIP341, with all relevant whole-transaction values precomputed once and cached. \r\n * 52ddb42100 **Support for Schnorr signatures and integration in SignatureCheckers (BIP 340)**: This enables the schnorrsig module in libsecp256k1, adds the relevant types and functions to src/pubkey, as well as in higher-level `SignatureChecker` classes. The (verification side of the) BIP340 test vectors is also added. \r\n * 828aed0abd **Implement Taproot validation (BIP 341)**: This includes key path spending and script path spending, but not the Tapscript execution implementation (leaf 0xc0 remains unemcumbered in this commit). \r\n * a39a7ec822 **Use ScriptExecutionData to pass through annex hash**: Instead of recomputing the annex hash every time a signature is verified, compute it once and cache it in a new ScriptExecutionData structure. \r\n * ebce9826f9 **Implement Tapscript script validation rules (BIP 342)**: This adds a new `SigVersion::TAPSCRIPT`, makes the necessary interpreter changes to make it implement BIP342, and uses them for leaf version 0xc0 in Taproot script path spends. \r\n * 812c85615c **Make Taproot spends standard + policy limits**: This adds a `TxoutType::WITNESS_V1_TAPROOT` for P2TR outputs, and permits spending them in standardness rules. No corresponding `CTxDestination` is added for it, as that isn't needed until we want wallet integration. The taproot validation flags are also enabled for mempool transactions, and standardness rules are added (stack item size limit, no annexes). \r\n * 5ee49fd3b8 **Activate Taproot/Tapscript on regtest (BIP 341, BIP 342)**: Define a versionbits-based activation for the new consensus rules on regtest. No activation or activation mechanism is defined for testnet or mainnet. \r\n * 697d461682 **[TESTS] Add BIP340 Schnorr signature support to test framework**: Add a pure Python implementation of BIP340 signing and verification, tested against the BIP's test vectors. \r\n * fd6e288349 **[TESTS] Functional tests for Schnorr/Taproot/Tapscript**: A large functional test is added that automatically generates random transactions which exercise various aspects of the new rules, and verifies they are accepted into the mempool (when appropriate), and correctly accepted/rejected in (Python-constructed) blocks. \r\n * 64030b1152 **[TESTS] Add minimized test vector as unit test**: This adds a relatively small set of test cases for the BIP341/BIP342 script validation rules as a unit test. The tests were generated by modifying the feature_taproot.py randomized tester to dump the constructed transactions and witnesses used, and using the fuzzing framework to minimize it. \r\n\r\n### Updates 2020-09-22 (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/33b6a13c86...076dfd97a37678fb7fe818f94e37ede6b5d6048d) [+38 -38]:\r\n * 4f5272cf5c **Document length assumption in XOnlyPubKey::VerifySchnorr correctly**: \r\n * 672b1af9c2 **Make IsOpSuccess match BIP text more closely**: \r\n * c22d75b702 **Use OP_SUCCESSx instead of SUCCESSx in error message**: \r\n * 550edc05e5 **Simplify/clarify tweak_add_{priv,pub}_key in tests**: \r\n * 076dfd97a3 **Python assert does not need parens**: \r\n\r\n### Update: test vectors in qa-assets (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/388928824e...9dfcd363a9) [+98 -43]:\r\n * 00d8575ffc **Always clone qa-assets repo in CI, but shallowly**: \r\n * 35fc47be36 **Improve script unit test and use qa-assets JSON**: \r\n\r\n### Updates 2020/09/23 (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/9dfcd363a9...7d694f8f7606de64d864ed87d8fe1d2037a46ec6) [+6 -110]:\r\n * cdc57baa72 **Script interpreter nits**: \r\n * 2612d16422 **Document implicit CLEANSTACK/MINIMALIF in witv0/tapscript execution**: \r\n * 7d694f8f76 **Remove script_taproot_tests (moved to qa-assets)**: \r\n\r\n### Updates 2020/09/24 (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/b5d2f3bab8...1ec9ce2ed7a8c95228f0c3ee473531eb8ab6119d) [+28 -13]:\r\n * 4181a0c1d6 **Exit bip143/341 checking loop early**: \r\n * 4e6c2005f4 **Make SignatureHashCache take cache reference instead of pointer**: \r\n * 29bf92a5b0 **Use separate script error for tapscript MINIMALIF**: \r\n * 1ec9ce2ed7 **Add a test for consensus CLEANSTACK in tapscript**: \r\n\r\n### Updates 2020/10/01 (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/8e8b45868b...99c50a691a) [+294 -27]:\r\n * ba4ac3e832 **Improve some code comments**: \r\n * c634f7ecdb **Compute witnesses only once for each input in feature_taproot.py**: Instead of re-evaluating the entire signing logic for every input, for every attempt, compute them once and reuse them. \r\n * 9e963a0ffb **Run legacy tests with both compressed and uncompressed keys**: \r\n * 687c91ae54 **Use a separate prefix for legacy tests that need taproot validation tests**: \r\n * 6d23fd6a09 **Add support for dumping generated test cases**: \r\n * 7d5fd3c1d9 **Add fuzz 'test' to minimize script_assets_test.json**: \r\n\r\n### Merge with master 2020/10/02 (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/99c50a691a...6cf077da50e9a2a3fdeaac9e96be5312d3cb8d76) [+21666 -4524]:\r\n * 31031361c3 **Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' into taproot-history**: \r\n * 6cf077da50 **Fix expected error message in feature_taproot.py**: \r\n\r\n### Updates 2020/10/06 (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/490b974364...10b9a4836a3bf57ce59d741ae5dfab5cdf0186e6) [+11 -7]:\r\n * 4ade5781b4 **Avoid a ScriptExecutionData copy in EvalScript**: \r\n * 10b9a4836a **Remove inadvertantly added newlines**: \r\n\r\n### Updates 2020/10/07 (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/68ebf4a2de...836232441c41788c720a7858c0521c9ea405c5b7) [+21 -17]:\r\n * 3265f14e39 **Variable naming/typing/calling improvements**: \r\n * c1710042e5 **Use more constexpr**: \r\n * 2ea6a0a3c2 **Consistent comment style**: \r\n * 836232441c **Add comments referencing the BIPs**: \r\n\r\n### Updates 2020/10/08 (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/5a7897645a...67750a3e1ed1696c09a998d7f5758394d896f99d) [+85 -72]:\r\n * fb6bc8a099 **Decide key_version based on sigversion instead of passing through**: \r\n * 67750a3e1e **Report more detailed signature validation errors**: \r\n\r\n### Updates 2020/10/11 (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/ce24bbba4b...7029ff57025a5e3fcc755b5da288ff70e2f2d2d7) [+13 -15]:\r\n * 2127387e30 **Add extra assertion on spent_outputs size**: \r\n * 11c05b47d7 **Rename fSuccess -> success in comments**: \r\n * 1a464c6c4c **Small fixes to feature_taproot.py**: \r\n * 7029ff5702 **Some style fixes**: \r\n\r\n### Updates 2020/10/12 (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/compare/36f4fa5ef9...4e2ac63b16a0764f903c639712cee86d8eacc96c) [+5 -5]:\r\n * 34a93d775a **Really rename fuccess -> success in comments**: \r\n * 4e2ac63b16 **Pass tapleaf_hash by reference to VerifyTaprootCommitment**: \r\n",

          "body": "This is a followup to #19339, refining upon the 2xATMP approach. It adds a `GetTransactionFee` utility function which uses `CheckTxInputs` to get a transaction fee.\r\n\r\nIt also updates the Absurd Fee checking (see `BroadcastTransaction` in src/node/transaction.cpp):\r\n* Use `GetTransactionFee` to get the fee. \r\n    - If it fails, dry-run ATMP to return a proper validation result. (`GetTransactionFee` does not take responsibility for filling in `TxValidationState` although it may be modified).\r\n    - If it succeeds, check against `max_tx_fee`. If fee is too high, just return `MAX_FEE_EXCEEDED`.\r\n* If fee is ok, call ATMP to submit to mempool. Broadcast.\r\n\r\nATMP is called at most 1 time. I think it's best to dry-run ATMP in the failure case because ATMP should be the authority on validation, i.e. be responsible for filling in `TxValidationResult` here. If the results don't match; i.e. `GetTransactionFee` fails but ATMP somehow succeeds (which _should_ never happen), we don't risk accidentally allowing an absurd fee through.",

We get clearer visibility into what currently lies in consensus codepaths **and** what depends on our consensus engine\r\n> 1. We can coalesce duplicate consensus initialization codepaths, mitigating against bugs that arise out of test/non-test initialization inconsistencies\r\n\r\n### De-globalizing `g_chainman`\r\n\r\nExcerpt from #20049\r\n> In order to modularize our consensus engine, we need to first de-globalize the global `ChainstateManager` -- namely `g_chainman` -- as it and its dependencies are what makes up the bulk of our consensus engine. A few direct references to `g_chainman` have already been removed in #19927, however, its indirect uses (mainly via `::Chain(state|)Active()`) are numerous in our codebase and often used to ~~cheat~~ avoid obtaining a `ChainstateManager` reference.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis changeset moves the global `ChainstateManger` to `NodeContext` and removes `::Chain{state,}Active()` as a first step towards better modularization of our consensus engine. \r\n\r\nThe commits are ordered as such:\r\n1. Fixes to our existing codebase crucial to subsequent changes in this changeset\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...dongcarl:2020-10-chainman-fixes\r\n1. Remove all references to `g_chainman`, `::Chain{state,}Active()`\r\n\t1. In `src/validation.{cpp,h}`\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions related to `::LookupBlockIndex` in the call graph\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/2020-10-chainman-fixes...dongcarl:2020-09-libbitcoinruntime-v4\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions that are mempool-related\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/dongcarl:2020-09-libbitcoinruntime-v4...2020-09-reduce-validation-mempool-ccsactiveglobal-usage\r\n\t\t1.

In `src/rest.cpp`\r\n\t1. In auxiliary modules of the codebase\r\n\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/dongcarl:2020-10-libbitcoinruntime-v7...2020-10-libbitcoinruntime-v8\r\n\t\t1. In `src/bench`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/index`\r\n\t1.

In `src/test`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/wallet/test`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/qt/test`\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n- The above ordering is constructed according to the overall call graph of our codebase such that we avoid touching the same function/module twice. \r\n- Due to the length of this overall change, each commit aims to be trivially-reviewable and only requires the reviewer to reason about the correctness of one function/module at a time.\r\n- There are a lot of review-only assertions which can be used to check for correctness. They are removed in 2236237070a45fe570cd0113f0025b0a46ac89be.\r\n",

          "body": "Compact blocks are used for efficient relay of blocks, either through High Bandwidth or Low Bandwidth mode. See [BIP 152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki) for full details.\r\n\r\nFor compact block relay to work, the receiver must have a mempool containing transactions which are likely to be included in the block. The receiver uses these transactions to reconstruct the block from the short transaction ids included in the `cmpctblock` message. Compact blocks are therefore only useful for relaying blocks at or near the tip of the block chain. For older blocks, the recipient won't have the transactions in their mempool and so would need to request them using a `getblocktxn` message. In such cases, just requesting the full block is more efficient.\r\n\r\nBIP 152 supports two versions: version 1 (without witnesses) and version 2 (with witnesses). Version 2 is required to reconstruct segwit blocks. Segwit was activated in August 2017, and providing non-witness blocks to peers is no longer useful. Since the witnesses are not included, the peer would not be able to fully validate all the consensus rules on the provided block.\r\n\r\nTherefore, stop supporting version 1 compact blocks. Ignore `sendcmpct` messages with version=1, and don't advertise support by sending `sendcmpct` with version=1. Only send `sendcmpct` to peers with `NODE_WITNESS`. Respond to all requests for compact blocks or blocktxns with witness-serialized blocks and transactions.",

Where should the univalue changes go to, into https://github.com/bitcoin-core/univalue or into https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue?\r\n\r\nAnyways, here is some motivational data for the changes:\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor my [BitcoinUtxoVisualizer](https://github.com/martinus/BitcoinUtxoVisualizer) the limiting factor seems to be mostly bitcoind's JSON generation speed. Here are some optimizations that speed this up quite a bit for me. Here are some numbers:\r\n\r\n`./bench_bitcoin -filter=BlockToJsonVerbose`\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |  err% |         bra/op |   miss% | benchmarked commit\r\n|--------------------:|------:|---------------:|--------:|:----------\r\n|       66,877,763.00 |  0.1% | 101,638,376.00 |    0.4% | 349f17e\r\n|       57,915,056.00 |  1.2% |  85,882,830.00 |    0.5% | 26fd10a\r\n|       36,585,334.00 |  1.6% |  50,966,277.00 |    0.4% | 93f8240\r\n|       28,508,105.00 |  0.2% |  40,138,962.00 |    0.4% | 9b59b15\r\n\r\nSo the benchmark improves from 66.9ms to 28.5ms for me. I ran an a benchmark with `bitcoind` as well, with that protocol:\r\n\r\n1. start bitcoind, with this `bitcoin.conf`:\r\n    ```\r\n   server=1\r\n   rest=1\r\n   rpcport=8332\r\n   rpcthreads=32\r\n   rpcworkqueue=64\r\n   txindex=1\r\n   dbcache=2000\r\n   ```\r\n2. Wait until fully synced, and log message shows `loadblk thread exit`, so that bitcoind is idle.\r\n2. Run apache benchmark: 2000 requests, 12 parallel threads, fetching block nr. 600000:\r\n   ```\r\n   ab -n 2000 -c 12 \"http://127.0.0.1:8332/rest/block/00000000000000000007316856900e76b4f7a9139cfbfba89842c8d196cd5f91.json\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nResults for master, 349f17e: \r\n```\r\n    Concurrency Level:      12\r\n    Time taken for tests:   26.535 seconds\r\n    Complete requests:      2000\r\n    Failed requests:        0\r\n    Total transferred:      11192226000 bytes\r\n    HTML transferred:       11192124000 bytes\r\n    Requests per second:    75.37 [#/sec] (mean)\r\n    Time per request:       159.208 [ms] (mean)\r\n    Time per request:       13.267 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)\r\n    Transfer rate:          411911.64 [Kbytes/sec] received\r\n\r\n    Connection Times (ms)\r\n                min  mean[+/-sd] median   max\r\n    Connect:        0    0   0.0      0       0\r\n    Processing:    93  158  15.0    156     283\r\n    Waiting:       91  154  14.8    152     280\r\n    Total:         93  158  15.0    156     283\r\n\r\n    Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)\r\n    50%    156\r\n    66%    161\r\n    75%    164\r\n    80%    167\r\n    90%    174\r\n    95%    184\r\n    98%    200\r\n    99%    216\r\n    100%    283 (longest request)\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults for this PR, 9b59b15:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Concurrency Level:      12\r\n    Time taken for tests:   16.801 seconds\r\n    Complete requests:      2000\r\n    Failed requests:        0\r\n    Total transferred:      11192226000 bytes\r\n    HTML transferred:       11192124000 bytes\r\n    Requests per second:    119.04 [#/sec] (mean)\r\n    Time per request:       100.805 [ms] (mean)\r\n    Time per request:       8.400 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)\r\n    Transfer rate:          650556.74 [Kbytes/sec] received\r\n\r\n    Connection Times (ms)\r\n                min  mean[+/-sd] median   max\r\n    Connect:        0    0   0.0      0       0\r\n    Processing:    38  100  19.1     98     211\r\n    Waiting:       36   98  19.0     96     208\r\n    Total:         38  100  19.1     98     211\r\n\r\n    Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)\r\n    50%     98\r\n    66%    105\r\n    75%    110\r\n    80%    113\r\n    90%    123\r\n    95%    138\r\n    98%    155\r\n    99%    163\r\n    100%    211 (longest request)\r\n```",

          "body": "Closes #17862\r\n\r\nContext from [original comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17862#issuecomment-744285188) (minor edits):\r\n\r\n`RewindBlockIndex()` is a mechanism to allow nodes to be upgraded after segwit activation, while still keeping their chainstate/datadir in a consistent state. It works as follows:\r\n\r\n- A pre-segwit (i.e. v0.13.0 or older) node is running.\r\n-  Segwit activates. The pre-segwit node remains sync'ed to the tip, but is not enforcing the new segwit rules.\r\n- The user upgrades the node to a segwit-aware version (v0.13.1 or newer).\r\n- On startup, in `AppInitMain()`, `RewindBlockIndex()` is called. This walks the chain backwards from the tip, disconnecting and erasing blocks that from after segwit activation that weren't validated with segwit rules.\r\n- those blocks are then redownloaded (with witness data) and validated with segwit rules.\r\n\r\nThis logic probably isn't required any more since:\r\n\r\n- Segwit activated at height 481824, when the block chain was 130GB and the total number of txs was 250 million. Today, we're at height 667704, the blockchain is over 315GB and the total number of txs is over 600 million. Even if 20% of that added data is witness data (a high estimate), then around 150GB of transactions would need to be rewound to get back to segwit activation height. It'd probably be faster to simply validate from genesis, especially since we won't be validating any scripts before the assumevalid block. It's also unclear whether rewinding 150GB of transactions would even work. It's certainly never been tested.\r\n- Bitcoin Core v0.13 is hardly used any more. https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html shows less than 50 nodes running it. The software was EOL on Aug 1st 2018. It's very unlikely that anyone is running 0.13 and will want to upgrade to 0.22.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `NeedsRedownload()` which merely checks for insufficiently validated segwit blocks and requests that the user restarts the node with `-reindex`. Reindexing the block files upon restart will make the node rebuild chain state and block index from the `blk*.dat` files on disk. The node won't be able to index the blocks with `BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS`, so they will be missing from the chain and be re-downloaded, with witness data.\r\n\r\nRemoving this code allows the following (done in follow-up #21090):\r\n\r\n- removal of tests using `segwitheight=-1` in `p2p_segwit.py`.\r\n- in turn, that allows us to drop support for `-segwitheight=-1`, which is only supported for that test.\r\n- that allows us to always set `NODE_WITNESS` in our local services. The only reason we don't do that is to support `-segwitheight=-1`.\r\n- that in turn allows us to drop all of the `GetLocalServices() & NODE_WITNESS` checks inside `net_processing.cpp`, since our local services would always include `NODE_WITNESS`\r\n\r\n",

This bundle may _apparently_ introduce usage of `g_chainman` or `::Chain(state|)Active()` globals, but these are resolved later on in the overall PR. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n2. There may be seemingly obvious local references to `ChainstateManager` or other validation objects which are not being used in callers of the current function in question, this is done intentionally to **_keep each commit centered around one function/method_** to ease review and to make the overall change systematic. We don't assume anything about our callers. Rest assured that once we are considering that particular caller in later commits, we will use the obvious local references. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n3. When changing a function/method that has many callers (e.g. `LookupBlockIndex` with 55 callers), it is sometimes easier (and less error-prone) to use a scripted-diff. When doing so, there will be 3 commits in sequence so that every commit compiles like so:\r\n\t1. Add `new_function`, make `old_function` a wrapper of `new_function`, divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the local module only**\r\n\t2. Scripted-diff to divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the rest of the codebase**\r\n\t3. Remove `old_function`\r\n\r\nNote to self:\r\n- [x] Address: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20750#discussion_r579400663",

The disconnection of `CCoinsView`s right now doesn't quite achieve what's it's trying to do (prevent `MemPoolAccept` from unnecessarily accessing the coins cache and forgetting to uncache later). This PR improves it by doing 2 things:\r\n(1) Disconnect `m_viewmempool` from the coins cache when we don't need it to be connected.\r\n(2) Make `MemPoolAccept` destructor clean up after itself by uncaching coins accessed, instead of leaving it up to the caller. Only leave the coins cached when a transaction is accepted to mempool. In the future, if someone edits the `MemPoolAccept` class and forgets to consider uncaching, the default behavior is to uncache (which is safer).",

          "body": "This PR enables validation dry-runs of packages through the `testmempoolaccept` RPC. The expectation is that the results returned from `testmempoolaccept` are what you'd get from test-then-submitting each transaction individually, in that order (this means the package is expected to be sorted in topological order, for now at least). The validation is also atomic: in the case of failure, it immediately halts and may return \"unfinished\" `MempoolAcceptResult`s for transactions that weren't fully validated. The API for 1 transaction stays the same.\r\n\r\n**Motivation:** \r\n- This allows you to test validity for transaction chains (e.g. with multiple spending paths and where you don't want to broadcast yet); closes #18480.\r\n- It's also a first step towards package validation in a minimally invasive way.\r\n- The RPC commit happens to close #21074 by clarifying the \"allowed\" key.\r\n\r\nThere are a few added restrictions on the packages, mostly to simplify the logic for areas that aren't critical to main package use cases:\r\n- No package can have conflicts, i.e. none of them can spend the same inputs, even if it would be a valid BIP125 replacement.\r\n- The package cannot conflict with the mempool, i.e. RBF is disabled.\r\n- The total count of the package cannot exceed 25 (the default descendant count limit), and total size cannot exceed 101KvB (the default descendant size limit).\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for review comments and github isn't loading them, I have a gist compiling some topics of discussion [here](https://gist.github.com/glozow/c3acaf161c95bba491fce31585b2aaf7)\r\n",

This bundle may _apparently_ introduce usage of `g_chainman` or `::Chain(state|)Active()` globals, but these are resolved later on in the overall PR. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n2. There may be seemingly obvious local references to `ChainstateManager` or other validation objects which are not being used in callers of the current function in question, this is done intentionally to **_keep each commit centered around one function/method_** to ease review and to make the overall change systematic. We don't assume anything about our callers. Rest assured that once we are considering that particular caller in later commits, we will use the obvious local references. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n3. When changing a function/method that has many callers (e.g. `LookupBlockIndex` with 55 callers), it is sometimes easier (and less error-prone) to use a scripted-diff. When doing so, there will be 3 commits in sequence so that every commit compiles like so:\r\n\t1. Add `new_function`, make `old_function` a wrapper of `new_function`, divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the local module only**\r\n\t2. Scripted-diff to divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the rest of the codebase**\r\n\t3. Remove `old_function`",

Then the minimum activation height parameter is introduced. This also adds the minimum activation height as a third parameter of `-vbparams`. Additionally, the threshold is made a parameter of each deployment so that it can be customized for each deployment. Lastly several unit and functional tests are added.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this easier to backport, the names of functions and classes are largely unchanged (except where necessary for the height based things). This means that some things are misnamed as they refer to BIP 9 even though this is really BIP 8.\r\n\r\nThis PR borrows 2 commits from #19573 to implement height based versionbits, one commit from #21377 for tests, and 1 commit formerly part of #21380 for the threshold parameterization.",

There may be seemingly obvious local references to `ChainstateManager` or other validation objects which are not being used in callers of the current function in question, this is done intentionally to **_keep each commit centered around one function/method_** to ease review and to make the overall change systematic. We don't assume anything about our callers. Rest assured that once we are considering that particular caller in later commits, we will use the obvious local references. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n3. When changing a function/method that has many callers (e.g. `LookupBlockIndex` with 55 callers), it is sometimes easier (and less error-prone) to use a scripted-diff. When doing so, there will be 3 commits in sequence so that every commit compiles like so:\r\n\t1. Add `new_function`, make `old_function` a wrapper of `new_function`, divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the local module only**\r\n\t2. Scripted-diff to divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the rest of the codebase**\r\n\t3. Remove `old_function`",

          "body": "Currently versionbits deployments are stored in a simple C array in `Params`. Setting the actual values needs to be done externally. Since the memory is allocated and initialized when `Params` is initialized, it is possible to have a deployment with uninitialized (or otherwise garbage and invalid) values set for its parameters if something is forgotten when they are being set.\r\n\r\nInstead of this two step approach (create deployment object, then set its members), I think it is better to have a constructor where those parameters are passed in and set when the deployment is initialized. This PR does that. In order for this to work though, `vDeployments` cannot be a simple C array. It is instead changed to be a `std::map<DeploymentPos, VBitsDeployment>`. This maps the deployment enum to the `VBitsDeployment` object itself; this is essentially how we were using `vDeployments` previously. Additionally, by also changing `VersionBitsDeploymentInfo` to a map as well, we are able to remove `MAX_VERSION_BITS_DEPLOYMENT` and all of the places where we were iterating the deployments no longer need to cast an int to `DeploymentPos`.\r\n\r\nAn additional concern is that the members of `VBitsDeployment` are not const and could thus be accidentally changed during runtime. To prevent this, this PR makes all members of `VBitsDeployment` const.\r\n\r\nLastly, to make `VBitsDeployment` actually fully describe a deployment, this PR moves the number of blocks in a period into the struct. In order to ensure that this variable matches up with the retarget period, a unit test is added.\r\n\r\nBuilt on top of #21392 and #21380 for the refactors and other changes they make to `VBitsDeployment`.",

With additional modifications external signers could be used without a wallet in general, e.g. via `signrawtransaction`.\r\n\r\nThe `signerdisplayaddress` RPC is ranamed to `walletdisplayaddress` because it requires wallet context. A future `displayaddress` RPC call without wallet context could take a descriptor argument.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes a `rpc_help.py` failure when configured with `--disable-wallet`.",

This PR is largely the non-refactor portions of #19573.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the lockinontimeout parameter is made configurable through a `-vblot` command line option as has been suggested by many people. Note that no attempt is made to have lockinontimeout=true or lockinontimeout=false nodes try to find peers with the same policy. However nodes that set `-vblot` will have a user agent comment indicating this.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #21392 for the change to height based version bits, and #21399 for the renames.",

The specification has been otherwise unrevised since publication nearly a year and half ago.\r\n\r\nMinus tests and deployment, it's about 180 LOC.\r\n\r\nThis branch activates against regtest so you can test on your local node.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes standardness rules for a bare single CTV Hash script, which has applications for congestion control. Other than that there is limited support for bare scripts using CTV, although the patches to #16766 lay the groundwork for better wallet support with proper IsTrusted parents scanning, which can be amended later to handle chains of irrefutable transactions.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about the design of BIP-119 at https://utxos.org/. In particular I recommend the workshop transcript and slides https://utxos.org/workshops/ for a thorough review of how CTV works.\r\n\r\nYou can stress test CTV for complex examples by trying out the Sapio compiler: learn.sapio-lang.org. There is also some support for CTV in miniscript via the [Sapio Rust Miniscript Fork](https://github.com/sapio-lang/rust-miniscript). \r\n\r\nDiscussion welcome at ##ctv-bip-review in Libera.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to connect to a signet, I operate one you can connect to with the parameters below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[signet]\r\nsignetchallenge=512102946e8ba8eca597194e7ed90377d9bbebc5d17a9609ab3e35e706612ee882759351ae \r\naddnode=50.18.75.225\r\n```\r\nYou may also wish to have the below parameters for things to work nicely:\r\n```\r\nserver = 1\r\ntxindex=1\r\nrpcport=18332\r\nrpcworkqueue=1000\r\nfallbackfee=0.0002\r\nminrelaytxfee=0\r\n```",

If you're implying the `ComputeBlockVersion` to `versionbits.ComputeBlockVersion` change is a bit ugly, that could be fixed just by adding an `inline int32_t ComputeBlockVersion(pindexPrev, params) { return versionbits.ComputeBlockVersion(pindexPrev, params); }` in deploymentstatus.h (where the `versionbits` global is declared).",

The benefit is not exposing anything about the internal implementation outside of the .cpp file.\r\n\r\n> I think minimising the number of globals and keeping the lock and the things the lock is guarding together (which then allows stronger locking assertions [...]\r\n\r\nI think it's fine to have a global with internal linkage in a single implementation file. The problems with globals all come when they're externally linked and accessed from many places in the code. The point about locking assertions also isn't relevant here since we're not using `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(!) ` or `LOCKS_EXCLUDED()` for this mutex.",

Having looked at it again, I think the only thing that would really end up making awkward is the rpc/blockchain.cpp stuff (ie, it would mean templating the `SoftForkPushBack` function and having the compiler duplicate the code and possibly not de-duplicate it when optimising) but that's not necessarily a big deal.\r\n\r\nI've added a draft commit that switches to templated functions and static_asserts to see what that's like. It does make rpc/blockchain a bit bigger (after compiling with clang) so might need be worth some tweaking to avoid that, and the syntax is a bit clunky, but it seems plausible. Thoughts?",
