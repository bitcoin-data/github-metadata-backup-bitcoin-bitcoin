    "body": "I stumbled upon the `CTransaction` comparison operators while refactoring some nearby code. I found it surprising and not at all obvious that two transactions would test equal even if their witness data differed. It seems like an unnecessary potential footgun. Fix that by comparing against wtxid rather than txid.\r\n\r\nOutside of tests, there were only 3 users of these functions in the code-base:\r\n- Its use in the mempool has been replaced with an explicit txid comparison, as that's a tighter constraint and matches the old behavior. glozow suggested also upgrading this to an `Assume()`.\r\n- Its use in the wallet was accidentally doing the correct thing by ignoring witness data. I've changed that to an explicit witness removal so that `IsEquivalentTo` continues to work as-intended.\r\n- Its use in `getrawtransaction` is indifferent to the change.",

Indeed there should be no functional change here from the original behavior. It currently works by virtue of the equality operator comparing txids, but that's not _at all_ obvious just from looking at `IsEquivalentTo`. I figured it just kinda accidentally kept working correctly post-segwit, but I guess you were aware of that quirk :)\r\n\r\nManually stripping the witness scripts as well is much more straightforward imo.",
