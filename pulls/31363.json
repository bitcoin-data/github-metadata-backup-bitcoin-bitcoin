    "body": "Part of cluster mempool: #30289.\r\n\r\nThis introduces the `TxGraph` class, which encapsulates knowledge about the fees, sizes, and dependencies between all mempool transactions, but nothing else. In particular, it lacks knowledge about `CTransaction`, inputs, outputs, txids, wtxids, prioritization, validatity, policy rules, and a lot more. Being restricted to just those aspects of the mempool makes the behavior very easy to fully specify, and write simulation-based tests for (which are included in this PR).\r\n\r\nThe interface can be largely categorized into:\r\n* Mutation functions:\r\n  * `AddTransaction` (add a new transaction with specified feerate, and get a `Ref` object back to identity it).\r\n  * `RemoveTransaction` (given a `Ref` object, remove the transaction).\r\n  * `AddDependency` (given two `Ref` objects, add a dependency between them).\r\n  * `SetTransactionFeerate` (modify the feerate associated with a Ref object)\r\n* Inspector functions:\r\n  * `GetAncestors` (get the ancestor set in the form of `Ref*` pointers)\r\n  * `GetDescendants` (get the descendant set in the form of `Ref*` pointers)\r\n  * `GetCluster` (get the connected component set in the form of `Ref*` pointers, in the order they would be mined).\r\n  * `GetIndividualFeerate` (get the feerate of a tranaction)\r\n  * `GetChunkFeerate` (get the mining score of a transaction)\r\n* Staging functions:\r\n  * `StartStaging` (make all future mutations operate on a proposed transaction graph)\r\n  * `CommitStaging` (apply all the changes that are staged)\r\n  * `AbortStaging` (discard all the changes that are staged)\r\n\r\nInternally the graph data is kept in clustered form (partitioned into connected components), for which linearizations are maintained and updated as needed, hiding the low-level complexity of `cluster_linearize.h` from the users. Implementation-wise, mutations are generally applied lazily, appending to queues of to-be-removed transactions and to-be-added dependencies, so they can be batched for higher performance. Inspectors will generally only evaluate as much as is needed to answer queries, with roughly 5 levels of processing to go to fully instantiated and acceptable cluster linearizations:\r\n* `ApplyRemovals` (take batches of to-be-removed transactions and translate them to \"holes\" in the corresponding Clusters/DepGraphs).\r\n* `SplitAll` (creating holes in Clusters may cause them to break apart into smaller connected components, so make turn them into separate Clusters/linearizations).\r\n* `GroupClusters` (figure out which Clusters will need to be combined in order to add requested to-be-added dependencies, as these may span clusters).\r\n* `ApplyDependencies` (actually merge Clusters as precomputed by `GroupClusters`, and add the dependencies between them).\r\n* `MakeAcceptable` (perform the LIMO linearization algorithm on Clusters to make sure their linearizations are acceptable).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis is only an initial version of TxGraph, and some functionality is missing before #28676 can be rebased on top of it:\r\n* Mining interface (ability to iterate transactions quickly in mining score order).\r\n* Eviction interface (reverse of mining order, plus memory usage accounting).\r\n* Ability to inspect the would-be-constructed clusters (so they can be \"fixed\" if they violate policy rules, as opposed to just accepted/rejected, before applying - this is needed for reorgs which are not optional).\r\n* Interface for controlling how much effort is spent on LIMO. In this PR it is hardcoded.\r\n\r\nThen there are further improvements possible which would not block other work:\r\n* Making Cluster a virtual class with different implementations based on transaction count (which could dramatically reduce memory usage, as most Clusters are just a single transaction, for which the current implementation is overkill).\r\n* The ability to have background thread(s) for improving cluster linearizations.",
