    "body": "Part of cluster mempool: #30289.\r\n\r\n### 1. Overview\r\n\r\nThis introduces the `TxGraph` class, which encapsulates knowledge about the (effective) fees, sizes, and dependencies between all mempool transactions, but nothing else. In particular, it lacks knowledge about `CTransaction`, inputs, outputs, txids, wtxids, prioritization, validatity, policy rules, and a lot more. Being restricted to just those aspects of the mempool makes the behavior very easy to fully specify (ignoring the actual linearizations produced), and write simulation-based tests for (which are included in this PR).\r\n\r\n### 2. Interface\r\n\r\nThe interface can be largely categorized into:\r\n* Mutation functions:\r\n  * `AddTransaction` (add a new transaction with specified feerate, and get a `Ref` object back to identify it).\r\n  * `RemoveTransaction` (given a `Ref` object, remove the transaction).\r\n  * `AddDependency` (given two `Ref` objects, add a dependency between them).\r\n  * `SetTransactionFeerate` (modify the feerate associated with a Ref object).\r\n* Inspector functions:\r\n  * `GetAncestors` (get the ancestor set in the form of `Ref*` pointers)\r\n  * `GetDescendants` (get the descendant set in the form of `Ref*` pointers)\r\n  * `GetCluster` (get the connected component set in the form of `Ref*` pointers, in the order they would be mined).\r\n  * `GetIndividualFeerate` (get the feerate of a tranaction)\r\n  * `GetChunkFeerate` (get the mining score of a transaction)\r\n  * `CountDistinctClusters` (count the number of distinct clusters a list of `Ref`s belong to)\r\n* Staging functions:\r\n  * `StartStaging` (make all future mutations operate on a proposed transaction graph)\r\n  * `CommitStaging` (apply all the changes that are staged)\r\n  * `AbortStaging` (discard all the changes that are staged)\r\n* Miscellaneous functions:\r\n  * `DoWork` (do queued-up computations now, so that future operations are fast)\r\n\r\nThis `TxGraph::Ref` type used as a \"handle\" on transactions in the graph can be inherited from, and the idea is that in the full cluster mempool implementation (#28676, after it is rebased on this), `CTxMempoolEntry` will inherit from it, and all actually used Ref objects will be `CTxMempoolEntry`s. With that, the mempool code can just cast any `Ref*` returned by txgraph to `CTxMempoolEntry*`.\r\n\r\n### 3. Implementation\r\n\r\nInternally the graph data is kept in clustered form (partitioned into connected components), for which linearizations are maintained and updated as needed using the `cluster_linearize.h` algorithms under the hood, but this is hidden from the users of this class. Implementation-wise, mutations are generally applied lazily, appending to queues of to-be-removed transactions and to-be-added dependencies, so they can be batched for higher performance. Inspectors will generally only evaluate as much as is needed to answer queries, with roughly 5 levels of processing to go to fully instantiated and acceptable cluster linearizations, in order:\r\n1. `ApplyRemovals` (take batches of to-be-removed transactions and translate them to \"holes\" in the corresponding Clusters/DepGraphs).\r\n2. `SplitAll` (creating holes in Clusters may cause them to break apart into smaller connected components, so make turn them into separate Clusters/linearizations).\r\n3. `GroupClusters` (figure out which Clusters will need to be combined in order to add requested to-be-added dependencies, as these may span clusters).\r\n4. `ApplyDependencies` (actually merge Clusters as precomputed by `GroupClusters`, and add the dependencies between them).\r\n5. `MakeAcceptable` (perform the LIMO linearization algorithm on Clusters to make sure their linearizations are acceptable).\r\n\r\n### 4. Future work\r\n\r\nThis is only an initial version of TxGraph, and some functionality is missing before #28676 can be rebased on top of it:\r\n* The ability to get comparative feerate diagrams before/after for the set of staged changes (to evaluate RBF incentive-compatibility).\r\n* Mining interface (ability to iterate transactions quickly in mining score order) (see #31444).\r\n* Eviction interface (reverse of mining order, plus memory usage accounting) (see #31444).\r\n* Ability to inspect the would-be-constructed clusters (so they can be \"fixed\" if they violate policy rules, as opposed to just accepted/rejected, before applying - this is needed for reorgs which are not optional).\r\n* Interface for controlling how much effort is spent on LIMO. In this PR it is hardcoded.\r\n\r\nThen there are further improvements possible which would not block other work:\r\n* Making Cluster a virtual class with different implementations based on transaction count (which could dramatically reduce memory usage, as most Clusters are just a single transaction, for which the current implementation is overkill).\r\n* The ability to have background thread(s) for improving cluster linearizations.",

This implies that the fee it uses is the effective fee, not the modified fee that includes prioritization.\r\n\r\nHow are we accounting for the real mining score of a  `Ref` without that prioritization knowledge? The current mining algorithm uses the modified ancestor fee to calculate the mining score.\r\n\r\nCould you clarify how prioritization will be handled post-cluster mempool?",

Currently, unlinking can happen either through `Ref` destruction, or through `TxGraph::Cleanup()` (which unlinks anything not appearing in the graph anymore).\r\n* The `TxGraphImpl::m_entries` vector compaction happens transparently, whenever applicable; there is no `TxGraph::Cleanup()` any more. This can only happen after the corresponding `Ref` was destroyed (because that's now the only way to unlink).\r\n* To assist the calling code with cleaning up `Ref`s, a new `TxGraph::GetRemoved()` function is added, which is a pure inspector, and reports which Refs do not appear in either main or staging (if present) anymore.",
