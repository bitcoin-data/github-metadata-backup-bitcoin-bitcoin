    "body": "Part of cluster mempool: #30289.\r\n\r\n### 1. Overview\r\n\r\nThis introduces the `TxGraph` class, which encapsulates knowledge about the (effective) fees, sizes, and dependencies between all mempool transactions, but nothing else. In particular, it lacks knowledge about `CTransaction`, inputs, outputs, txids, wtxids, prioritization, validatity, policy rules, and a lot more. Being restricted to just those aspects of the mempool makes the behavior very easy to fully specify (ignoring the actual linearizations produced), and write simulation-based tests for (which are included in this PR).\r\n\r\n### 2. Interface\r\n\r\nThe interface can be largely categorized into:\r\n* Mutation functions:\r\n  * `AddTransaction` (add a new transaction with specified feerate, and get a `Ref` object back to identify it).\r\n  * `RemoveTransaction` (given a `Ref` object, remove the transaction).\r\n  * `AddDependency` (given two `Ref` objects, add a dependency between them).\r\n  * `SetTransactionFeerate` (modify the feerate associated with a Ref object).\r\n* Inspector functions:\r\n  * `GetAncestors` (get the ancestor set in the form of `Ref*` pointers)\r\n  * `GetDescendants` (get the descendant set in the form of `Ref*` pointers)\r\n  * `GetCluster` (get the connected component set in the form of `Ref*` pointers, in the order they would be mined).\r\n  * `GetIndividualFeerate` (get the feerate of a tranaction)\r\n  * `GetChunkFeerate` (get the mining score of a transaction)\r\n  * `CountDistinctClusters` (count the number of distinct clusters a list of `Ref`s belong to)\r\n* Staging functions:\r\n  * `StartStaging` (make all future mutations operate on a proposed transaction graph)\r\n  * `CommitStaging` (apply all the changes that are staged)\r\n  * `AbortStaging` (discard all the changes that are staged)\r\n* Miscellaneous functions:\r\n  * `DoWork` (do queued-up computations now, so that future operations are fast)\r\n\r\nThis `TxGraph::Ref` type used as a \"handle\" on transactions in the graph can be inherited from, and the idea is that in the full cluster mempool implementation (#28676, after it is rebased on this), `CTxMempoolEntry` will inherit from it, and all actually used Ref objects will be `CTxMempoolEntry`s. With that, the mempool code can just cast any `Ref*` returned by txgraph to `CTxMempoolEntry*`.\r\n\r\n### 3. Implementation\r\n\r\nInternally the graph data is kept in clustered form (partitioned into connected components), for which linearizations are maintained and updated as needed using the `cluster_linearize.h` algorithms under the hood, but this is hidden from the users of this class. Implementation-wise, mutations are generally applied lazily, appending to queues of to-be-removed transactions and to-be-added dependencies, so they can be batched for higher performance. Inspectors will generally only evaluate as much as is needed to answer queries, with roughly 5 levels of processing to go to fully instantiated and acceptable cluster linearizations, in order:\r\n1. `ApplyRemovals` (take batches of to-be-removed transactions and translate them to \"holes\" in the corresponding Clusters/DepGraphs).\r\n2. `SplitAll` (creating holes in Clusters may cause them to break apart into smaller connected components, so make turn them into separate Clusters/linearizations).\r\n3. `GroupClusters` (figure out which Clusters will need to be combined in order to add requested to-be-added dependencies, as these may span clusters).\r\n4. `ApplyDependencies` (actually merge Clusters as precomputed by `GroupClusters`, and add the dependencies between them).\r\n5. `MakeAcceptable` (perform the LIMO linearization algorithm on Clusters to make sure their linearizations are acceptable).\r\n\r\n### 4. Future work\r\n\r\nThis is only an initial version of TxGraph, and some functionality is missing before #28676 can be rebased on top of it:\r\n* The ability to get comparative feerate diagrams before/after for the set of staged changes (to evaluate RBF incentive-compatibility).\r\n* Mining interface (ability to iterate transactions quickly in mining score order) (see #31444).\r\n* Eviction interface (reverse of mining order, plus memory usage accounting) (see #31444).\r\n* Ability to inspect the would-be-constructed clusters (so they can be \"fixed\" if they violate policy rules, as opposed to just accepted/rejected, before applying - this is needed for reorgs which are not optional).\r\n* Interface for controlling how much effort is spent on LIMO. In this PR it is hardcoded.\r\n\r\nThen there are further improvements possible which would not block other work:\r\n* Making Cluster a virtual class with different implementations based on transaction count (which could dramatically reduce memory usage, as most Clusters are just a single transaction, for which the current implementation is overkill).\r\n* The ability to have background thread(s) for improving cluster linearizations.",

To get an idea of what is going on, I think it's useful to look (in order) at:\r\n* The `src/txgraph.h` file added in that commit, as it defines the public interface.\r\n* The `src/test/fuzz/txgraph.cpp` test added in the next commit ([txgraph: (tests) add simulation fuzz test](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31363/commits/fe5cba87972f192faa286473b3fbff96d2b1df29)), as it does to an extent show how the interface is used, and what is expected of it.\r\n* The data structures (`TxGraphImpl` and `Cluster`) in `src/txgraph.cpp`, and the internal functions corresponding to the 5 processing steps that happen:\r\n  * **Batch removal of queued transaction removals**: `TxGraphImpl::ApplyRemovals` and `Cluster::ApplyRemovals`.\r\n  * **Splitting of clusters into components after removing transactions**: `TxGraphImpl::SplitAll`, `TxGraphImpl::Split`, and `Cluster::Split`\r\n  * **Computing which clusters will need to be combined due to queued dependencies being added between them**: `TxGraphImpl::GroupClusters`.\r\n  * **Merging of clusters and applying queued dependencies to them**: `TxGraphImpl::ApplyDependencies`, `TxGraphImpl::Merge`, `Cluster::Merge`, `Cluster::ApplyDependencies`.\r\n  * **Making the linearization of clusters acceptable**: `TxGraphImpl::MakeAcceptable` and `Cluster::Relinearize`.\r\n* The interface implementation functions that are built on top in `TxGraphImpl`: `AddTransaction`, `RemoveTransaction`, `AddDependency`, `SetTransactionFee`, `Cleanup`, `GetAncestors`, `GetDescendants`, `GetCluster`, `GetChunkFeerate`, etc.\r\n\r\n",

This implies that the fee it uses is the effective fee, not the modified fee that includes prioritization.\r\n\r\nHow are we accounting for the real mining score of a  `Ref` without that prioritization knowledge? The current mining algorithm uses the modified ancestor fee to calculate the mining score.\r\n\r\nCould you clarify how prioritization will be handled post-cluster mempool?",

Currently, unlinking can happen either through `Ref` destruction, or through `TxGraph::Cleanup()` (which unlinks anything not appearing in the graph anymore).\r\n* The `TxGraphImpl::m_entries` vector compaction happens transparently, whenever applicable; there is no `TxGraph::Cleanup()` any more. This can only happen after the corresponding `Ref` was destroyed (because that's now the only way to unlink).\r\n* To assist the calling code with cleaning up `Ref`s, a new `TxGraph::GetRemoved()` function is added, which is a pure inspector, and reports which Refs do not appear in either main or staging (if present) anymore.",
