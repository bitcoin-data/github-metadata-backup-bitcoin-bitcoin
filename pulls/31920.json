    "body": "As discussed a good bit with fanquake and hebasto. Would be nice to have for v29, but it's very late, so no worries if it doesn't make it.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, this creates a \"Depends\" build type which represents the flags that were used to build depends as opposed to colliding with the other types.\r\n\r\nThis allows the forwarding of optional flags into the CMake build for the \"Depends\" build type, but the user can now optionally use an existing (Debug/RelWitDebInfo/etc.) type to ignore the optimization flags set by depends and use the ones from that type instead.\r\n\r\nAs an example, a user may do:\r\nmake -C depends\r\ncmake --toolchain depends/arm64-apple-darwin/toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\r\n\r\nThis would compile depends with the default optimization flags for depends (-O2) but build Core with the default debug optimization flags from CMake\r\n\r\nDepends note:\r\nFor hosts, $host_*FLAGS variables now represent the mandatory flags for compiling and will be forwarded to all Core builds via the toolchain file, regardless of the build type. For most platforms they should be empty, but are useful at least for darwin.\r\n\r\nWhen setting (for example) CFLAGS from the command line when building depends, these flags will be stored in $host_release_CFLAGS (or _debug_), and will only be forwarded to the Depends build type.",

Maybe the PR description can be updated to state some advantages of this new approach? Or some problems with the current approach that this new approach solves?\r\n> \r\n> I listed a few aspects of the cmake/depends integration that I thought seemed broken and counterintuitive in [#30813 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30813#issuecomment-2329412411) (after \"Specifically in the current system...\"), and it seems like none of these things are changing after this PR, so I can imagine this PR solving a different set of problems, but I'm not sure which problems.\r\n\r\nYeah, I don't think this is intended to address any of those concerns. This is intended to define a sane way of forwarding compile flags from depends. I do agree feature options aren't ideal at the moment though.\r\n\r\n> How does this interact with the depends DEBUG build? It looks like this is a breaking change for people (and the ci) picking the Debug build type afterwards. It would be good to clarify this and also adjust the CI scripts, if needed.\r\n\r\nWith this, building depends with DEBUG simply means that the \"Depends\" type now holds the debug flags (currently `-O1 -g` from depends).\r\n\r\nHere's a quick before/after reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake -C depends\r\ncmake -B build --toolchain depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/toolchain.cmake\r\nresulting cxxflags before: -pipe -std=c++20 -O2 -O2 -g\r\nresulting cxxflags after:  -O2\r\n\r\nmake -C depends\r\ncmake -B build --toolchain depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\r\nresulting cxxflags before: -pipe -std=c++20 -O0 -ftrapv -g3\r\nresulting cxxflags after:  -O0 -ftrapv -g3\r\n\r\nmake -C depends DEBUG=1\r\ncmake -B build --toolchain depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/toolchain.cmake\r\nresulting cxxflags before: -pipe -std=c++20 -O2 -g\r\nresulting cxxflags after:  -O1 -g\r\n\r\nmake -C depends DEBUG=1\r\ncmake -B build --toolchain depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\r\nresulting cxxflags before: -pipe -std=c++20 -O0 -ftrapv -O1 -g3 -g3\r\nresulting cxxflags after:  -O0 -ftrapv -g3\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, the \"Depends\" build type now comes from the debug/release flags, and the rest are mandatory that get passed to all build types.\r\n\r\nI think this is a much saner system, but it did change/break a few things, so it's not ready to go in as-is. Will convert to draft. Curious to see if there are any Concept ACKs here though. It's not ideal, but at least it's not arbitrary clobbering as we have now.\r\n\r\nThe issues specifically are:\r\n- `-g` is now off for a default depends Core build because it's off for the \"release\" depends builds\r\n- only the \"Depends\" build works for Linux with DEBUG=1 because `-D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG` is then required unconditionally (Debug/Release/RelWithDebInfo won't work)\r\n- Guix would probably need to be explicitly set to RelWithDebInfo so that it's allowed to diverge from depends\r\n- ci builds that use the Debug type would need to be updated as that's probably not necessary anymore (this one is actually a good thing)",

This is intended to define a sane way of forwarding compile flags from depends.\r\n\r\nCan you explain what specific problems or concerns this PR is addressing?\r\n\r\nI can see looking at the current toolchain file that it does some odd things, but it looks to me like those things could be directly fixed using an approach like I described https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30813#issuecomment-2329412411, where we define a clear precedence order like \"the depends toolchain file should be able to see and freely override cmake defaults, and users should be able to see and freely override depends defaults\" and then implement it.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, instead of choosing a precedence order, this adds a new \"depends\" build type that gives users a choice of whether to ignore cmake defaults and use depends defaults by using the new \"depends\" build type, or to ignore depends defaults and use cmake defaults by using an ordinary build type.\r\n\r\nThis seems kludgy to me because the both choices seem suboptimal and the choice itself should be unnecessary when cmake seems to provide everything the depends system needs to set sane default values for existing build types without introducing a new build type.\r\n\r\nBut it's hard to evaluate this PR without knowing what specific problems it is trying to address, since maybe they are not the same as the ones I can see.",
