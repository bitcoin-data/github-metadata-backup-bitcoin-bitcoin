    "body": "The interaction between node startup options like `-blockreservedweight` and runtime options, especially those passed via IPC, is confusing.\r\n\r\nThey're combined in `BlockAssembler::Options`, which this PR gets rid of in favour of two distinct structs:\r\n\r\n1. `BlockCreateOptions`: used by interface clients. As before, IPC clients have access to a safe / sane subset, whereas RPC and test code can use all fields.\r\n2. `MiningArgs`: these are set once during node startup\r\n\r\nBoth structs have a member for the maximum block height, which is not a problem since they're different structs. The one on `MiningArgs` (`block_max_weight`) matches `-maxblockheight` and is left alone. The one on `BlockCreateOptions` (`block_max_weight`) is an optional, it's set by `ApplyMiningDefaults` only if empty. \r\n\r\nThis all happens in the last commit and requires some preparation to keep things easy to review.\r\n\r\nWe get rid of `BlockAssembler::Options` but this is used in many tests. Since large churn is inevitable, we might as well switch all tests, bench and fuzzers over to the Mining interface. The first (non-base) commit does that, dramatically reducing direct use of `BlockAssembler`. Two exceptions are documented in the commit message. Because `test_block_validity` wasn't available via the interface and the block_assemble benchmark needs it, it's moved from `BlockAssembler::Options` to `BlockCreateOptions` (still not exposed via IPC).\r\n\r\nWe need access to mining related defaults and structs from both the miner and node initialization code. To avoid having to pull in all of `BlockAssembler` for the latter, the second commit introduces `node/mining.h` and moves constants and structs there from `src/node/types.h` (`BlockCreateOptions`, `BlockWaitOptions`, `BlockCheckOptions`) and `src/node/miner.h` (`DEFAULT_PRINT_MODIFIED_FEE`).\r\n\r\nI considered also moving `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT`, `DEFAULT_BLOCK_RESERVED_WEIGHT`, `MINIMUM_BLOCK_RESERVED_WEIGHT` and `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MIN_TX_FEE` there from `policy.h`, since they are distinct from relay policy and not needed by the kernel. But this seems more appropriate for a follow-up and requires additional discussion.\r\n\r\nThe meat and potatoes of this PR is split between the three last commits for easier review:\r\n\r\n1. Adds `node/mining_args.{h,cpp}` and move the options checking out of `init.cpp`, without adding storage\r\n2. Add `block_max_weight` to `BlockCreateOptions` as explained above\r\n3. Introduce the `MiningArgs` struct, add it to the `NodeContext`, expand `mining_args.cpp` to store it, pass it to `BlockAssembler`, etc.\r\n\r\nI kept variable renaming and other formatting changes to a minimum to ease review with `--color-moved=dimmed-zebra`.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the bug fix in:\r\n- [ ] #33965\r\n\r\nOnce that is merged, this PR should not change behaviour.",

However, a CI failure may still\nhappen due to a number of reasons, for example:\n\n* Possibly due to a silent merge conflict (the changes in this pull request being\nincompatible with the current code in the target branch). If so, make sure to rebase on the latest\ncommit of the target branch.\n\n* A sanitizer issue, which can only be found by compiling with the sanitizer and running the\n  affected test.\n\n* An intermittent issue.\n\nLeave a comment here, if you need help tracking down a confusing failure.\n\n</details>\n\n",

Also nice to port more code to use `interfaces::Mining`. Other changes seem less positive. Before, there was a clear separation of which options were controllable by `interfaces/mining.h` and which options were internal and not part of the public interface. But now all options are mixed together in `node/mining.h`. For example the `BlockCreateOptions` struct passed to `createNewBlock` has a `block_max_weight` member, but setting that member will not do anything, because it will always be overridden by the `MiningArgs::nBlockMaxWeight` in `ClampOptions`. Also, as long as the `-blockreservedweight` option exists, maybe it would be nice if miners could use this value instead of having to provide their own value, so it could be nice to use std::optional for settings that can come from 2 places instead of the more ad-hoc approach here.\r\n\r\n",

But now all options are mixed together in `node/mining.h`.\r\n> \r\n> What would be a good way to organize these things? E.g. having `BlockCreateOptions`, `BlockWaitOptions` and `BlockCheckOptions` defined in `node/types.h` wasn't great either, because Mining interface clients don't care the other structs in that file.\r\n\r\nOh I see. You mean you want the mining interface options separate from the `TransactionError` `TxBroadcast` enum types? I guess I put all these types in the same category because they are all used by `src/interfaces/` code and by cap'n proto interfaces in later multiprocess PRs. But it is does seem reasonable to move these to a separate header like `mining.h`. I would just want to the structs not to have any fields that get ignored, and would want to move `MiningArgs` to different file, since it's an internal type.\r\n",
