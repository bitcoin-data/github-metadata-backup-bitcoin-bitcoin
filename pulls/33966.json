    "body": "The interaction between node startup options like `-blockreservedweight` and runtime options, especially those passed via IPC, is confusing.\r\n\r\nThey're combined in `BlockAssembler::Options`, which this PR gets rid of in favour of two distinct structs:\r\n\r\n1. `BlockCreateOptions`: used by interface clients. As before, IPC clients have access to a safe / sane subset, whereas RPC and test code can use all fields.\r\n2. `MiningArgs`: these are set once during node startup\r\n\r\nBoth structs have a member for the maximum block height, which is not a problem since they're different structs. The one on `MiningArgs` (`block_max_weight`) matches `-maxblockheight` and is left alone. The one on `BlockCreateOptions` (`block_max_weight`) is an optional, it's set by `ApplyMiningDefaults` only if empty. \r\n\r\nThis all happens in the last commit and requires some preparation to keep things easy to review.\r\n\r\nWe get rid of `BlockAssembler::Options` but this is used in many tests. Since large churn is inevitable, we might as well switch all tests, bench and fuzzers over to the Mining interface. The first (non-base) commit does that, dramatically reducing direct use of `BlockAssembler`. Two exceptions are documented in the commit message. Because `test_block_validity` wasn't available via the interface and the block_assemble benchmark needs it, it's moved from `BlockAssembler::Options` to `BlockCreateOptions` (still not exposed via IPC).\r\n\r\nWe need access to mining related defaults and structs from both the miner and node initialization code. To avoid having to pull in all of `BlockAssembler` for the latter, the second commit introduces `node/mining.h` and moves constants and structs there from `src/node/types.h` (`BlockCreateOptions`, `BlockWaitOptions`, `BlockCheckOptions`) and `src/node/miner.h` (`DEFAULT_PRINT_MODIFIED_FEE`).\r\n\r\nI considered also moving `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT`, `DEFAULT_BLOCK_RESERVED_WEIGHT`, `MINIMUM_BLOCK_RESERVED_WEIGHT` and `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MIN_TX_FEE` there from `policy.h`, since they are distinct from relay policy and not needed by the kernel. But this seems more appropriate for a follow-up and requires additional discussion.\r\n\r\nThe meat and potatoes of this PR is split between the three last commits for easier review:\r\n\r\n1. Adds `node/mining_args.{h,cpp}` and move the options checking out of `init.cpp`, without adding storage\r\n2. Add `block_max_weight` to `BlockCreateOptions` as explained above\r\n3. Introduce the `MiningArgs` struct, add it to the `NodeContext`, expand `mining_args.cpp` to store it, pass it to `BlockAssembler`, etc.\r\n\r\nI kept variable renaming and other formatting changes to a minimum to ease review with `--color-moved=dimmed-zebra`.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the bug fix in:\r\n- [ ] #33965\r\n\r\nOnce that is merged, this PR should not change behaviour.",

Also nice to port more code to use `interfaces::Mining`. Other changes seem less positive. Before, there was a clear separation of which options were controllable by `interfaces/mining.h` and which options were internal and not part of the public interface. But now all options are mixed together in `node/mining.h`. For example the `BlockCreateOptions` struct passed to `createNewBlock` has a `block_max_weight` member, but setting that member will not do anything, because it will always be overridden by the `MiningArgs::nBlockMaxWeight` in `ClampOptions`. Also, as long as the `-blockreservedweight` option exists, maybe it would be nice if miners could use this value instead of having to provide their own value, so it could be nice to use std::optional for settings that can come from 2 places instead of the more ad-hoc approach here.\r\n\r\n",

But now all options are mixed together in `node/mining.h`.\r\n> \r\n> What would be a good way to organize these things? E.g. having `BlockCreateOptions`, `BlockWaitOptions` and `BlockCheckOptions` defined in `node/types.h` wasn't great either, because Mining interface clients don't care the other structs in that file.\r\n\r\nOh I see. You mean you want the mining interface options separate from the `TransactionError` `TxBroadcast` enum types? I guess I put all these types in the same category because they are all used by `src/interfaces/` code and by cap'n proto interfaces in later multiprocess PRs. But it is does seem reasonable to move these to a separate header like `mining.h`. I would just want to the structs not to have any fields that get ignored, and would want to move `MiningArgs` to different file, since it's an internal type.\r\n",
