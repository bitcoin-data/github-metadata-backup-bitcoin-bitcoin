    "body": "The interaction between node startup options like `-blockreservedweight` and runtime options, especially those passed via IPC, is confusing.\r\n\r\nThey're combined in `BlockAssembler::Options`, which this PR gets rid of in favour of two distinct structs:\r\n\r\n1. `BlockCreateOptions`: used by interface clients. As before, IPC clients have access to a safe / sane subset, whereas RPC and test code can use all fields.\r\n2. `MiningArgs`: these are set once during node startup\r\n\r\nBoth structs have a member for the maximum block height, which is not a problem since they're different structs. The one on `MiningArgs` (`block_max_weight`) matches `-maxblockheight` and is left alone. The one on `BlockCreateOptions` (`block_max_weight`) is an optional, it's set by `ApplyMiningDefaults` only if empty. \r\n\r\nThis all happens in the last commit and requires some preparation to keep things easy to review.\r\n\r\nWe get rid of `BlockAssembler::Options` but this is used in many tests. Since large churn is inevitable, we might as well switch all tests, bench and fuzzers over to the Mining interface. The first (non-base) commit does that, dramatically reducing direct use of `BlockAssembler`. Two exceptions are documented in the commit message. Because `test_block_validity` wasn't available via the interface and the block_assemble benchmark needs it, it's moved from `BlockAssembler::Options` to `BlockCreateOptions` (still not exposed via IPC).\r\n\r\nWe need access to mining related defaults and structs from both the miner and node initialization code. To avoid having to pull in all of `BlockAssembler` for the latter, the second commit introduces `node/mining.h` and moves constants and structs there from `src/node/types.h` (`BlockCreateOptions`, `BlockWaitOptions`, `BlockCheckOptions`) and `src/node/miner.h` (`DEFAULT_PRINT_MODIFIED_FEE`).\r\n\r\nI considered also moving `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT`, `DEFAULT_BLOCK_RESERVED_WEIGHT`, `MINIMUM_BLOCK_RESERVED_WEIGHT` and `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MIN_TX_FEE` there from `policy.h`, since they are distinct from relay policy and not needed by the kernel. But this seems more appropriate for a follow-up and requires additional discussion.\r\n\r\nThe meat and potatoes of this PR is split between the three last commits for easier review:\r\n\r\n1. Adds `node/mining_args.{h,cpp}` and move the options checking out of `init.cpp`, without adding storage\r\n2. Add `block_max_weight` to `BlockCreateOptions` as explained above\r\n3. Introduce the `MiningArgs` struct, add it to the `NodeContext`, expand `mining_args.cpp` to store it, pass it to `BlockAssembler`, etc.\r\n\r\nI kept variable renaming and other formatting changes to a minimum to ease review with `--color-moved=dimmed-zebra`.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the bug fix in:\r\n- [ ] #33965\r\n\r\nOnce that is merged, this PR should not change behaviour.",

Also nice to port more code to use `interfaces::Mining`. Other changes seem less positive. Before, there was a clear separation of which options were controllable by `interfaces/mining.h` and which options were internal and not part of the public interface. But now all options are mixed together in `node/mining.h`. For example the `BlockCreateOptions` struct passed to `createNewBlock` has a `block_max_weight` member, but setting that member will not do anything, because it will always be overridden by the `MiningArgs::nBlockMaxWeight` in `ClampOptions`. Also, as long as the `-blockreservedweight` option exists, maybe it would be nice if miners could use this value instead of having to provide their own value, so it could be nice to use std::optional for settings that can come from 2 places instead of the more ad-hoc approach here.\r\n\r\n",

But now all options are mixed together in `node/mining.h`.\r\n> \r\n> What would be a good way to organize these things? E.g. having `BlockCreateOptions`, `BlockWaitOptions` and `BlockCheckOptions` defined in `node/types.h` wasn't great either, because Mining interface clients don't care the other structs in that file.\r\n\r\nOh I see. You mean you want the mining interface options separate from the `TransactionError` `TxBroadcast` enum types? I guess I put all these types in the same category because they are all used by `src/interfaces/` code and by cap'n proto interfaces in later multiprocess PRs. But it is does seem reasonable to move these to a separate header like `mining.h`. I would just want to the structs not to have any fields that get ignored, and would want to move `MiningArgs` to different file, since it's an internal type.\r\n",

Am wondering if we actually need two overlapping structs and two very similar error checking functions or can get away with one of each. Also if we still need to keep the clamping behavior or could just have errors raised if values are out of bounds? There are still std::clamp calls but I'm not sure if they are dead code.\n\nI'm thinking maybe we could have a single `BlockCreateOptions` struct with mostly `std::optional` members and one `ReadMiningArgs(const ArgsManager& args, BlockCreateOptions& options)` function that applies command line settings, and a `ApplyMiningDefaults(BlockCreateOptions&)` that applies default settings and returns errors and that would be sufficient?\n\nNo problems with current approach though, and additional simplifications could be made on top of this.",

In the last commit.\r\n\r\n> Am wondering if we actually need two overlapping structs and two very similar error checking functions or can get away with one of each.\r\n\r\nSince `getblocktemplate` is based on values set at node launch (`MiningArgs`) while IPC is dynamic per request (`BlockCreateOptions`) I think it makes sense to separate these. This even holds after #34568 introduces defaults for IPC clients.\r\n\r\nBut I did add helper functions for max weight, reserved weight (and sigop count, to be future proof)  to address the overlap in the checking functions `ReadMiningArgs` and `ClampOptions`. I put them inline in `mining_types.h`, if you don't mind, it seems ok because these limits are relevant to clients.",

It shouldn't declare or use functions or classes with methods unless they are header-only or provided by the `util` library. (Some other projects have public include directories to keep internal & external headers separate, but for now we only mark the distinction with comments.)\n\nMIght also be good to rename this file `mining_types.h` or similar to reduce temptation to declare functions and classes not available over IPC here and distinguish from `miner.h` more",

(Could also replace `{}` with `BlockCreateOptions{}` on the line below to clarify that parameter.)",
