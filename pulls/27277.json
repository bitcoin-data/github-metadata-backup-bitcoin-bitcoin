    "body": "When running with `-debug=validation` the log is filled with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-03-19T12:46:01Z [validation] Enqueuing TransactionAddedToMempool: txid=37c8e1ef87d75a67fbaf44e116018fbc70d9c4ef0e27e2ae56861395101f9b8e wtxid=24e2d76012f9cde451d085ead4feab136feddae6cb55d37221a81aac6c0eaf42\r\n2023-03-19T12:46:01Z [validation] TransactionAddedToMempool: txid=37c8e1ef87d75a67fbaf44e116018fbc70d9c4ef0e27e2ae56861395101f9b8e wtxid=24e2d76012f9cde451d085ead4feab136feddae6cb55d37221a81aac6c0eaf42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese log entries are more appropriate for `-debug=mempool`.\r\n\r\nThis change limits `-debug=validation` to messages that are related to blocks and headers. It makes it easier to run for a long time without excessive log file growth. This debug category is particularly useful for keeping track of problematic headers that were seen, the timing of reorgs, see also #27276.\r\n\r\nSince this PR touches `validationinterface.cpp` anyway, it also includes a commit to drop function names from log messages, since we now have `-logsourcelocations`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, though less important, I moved `[validation] Pre-allocating up to position 0x… in rev….dat` messages to blockstorage. This reduces the number of `[validation]` log messages to 3 per (normal) block.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volume of log messages [could also have been reduced](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27277#discussion_r1141375638) by changing the log level of these messages to `trace`. Doing so would prevent a whack-a-mole game of moving log messages to different categories. However in this case I think the change in log category would be justified even if it didn't have a big impact on noise. I.e. someone running with `-debug=mempool` would expect to see the `TransactionAddedToMempool` messages and someone running with `-debug=blockstorage` would perhaps be surprised to not see the `Pre-allocating` message.",
