    "body": "This change consists of three commits:\r\n\r\n* The first commit is a pure refactoring that removes the restriction that two wallets can only be opened at the same time if they are contained in the same directory.\r\n* The second commit removes the restriction that `-wallet` filenames can only refer to files in the `-walletdir` directory.\r\n* The third commit makes second commit a little safer by changing bitcoin to create wallet databases as directories rather than files, so they can be safely backed up.\r\n\r\nAll three commits should be straightforward:\r\n\r\n*  The first commit adds around 20 lines of new code and then updates a bunch of function signatures (generally updating them to take plain fs::path parameters, instead of combinations of strings, fs::paths, and objects like CDBEnv and CWalletDBWrapper).\r\n* The second commit removes two `-wallet` filename checks and adds some test cases to the multiwallet unit test.\r\n* The third commit just changes the mapping from specified wallet paths to bdb environment & data paths.\r\n\r\n  ---\r\n\r\n**Note:** For anybody looking at this PR for the first time, I think you can skip the comments before _20 Nov_ and start reading at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11687#issuecomment-345625565. Comments before  _20 Nov_ were about an earlier version of the PR that didn't include the third commit, and then confusion from not seeing the first commit.",

To prevent this, bitcoin spends so much time consolidating the wallet database at runtime (in the MaybeCompactWalletDB thread), and does it at least at a clean shutdown.\r\n\r\nPeople are moving around wallet.dat already, from and to the data directory, so I'm not convinced that supporting multiple wallet directories in principle makes the risk much larger that wallets are separated from their database directory while \"live\". \r\n\r\nBut indeed, a database environment has to be created where the wallets are.

If you added support for multiple database environments you get my concept ACK.\r\n\r\n> Suggest renaming wallet.dat in the directory to wallet.bdb to convey the fact that you can't just copy the file to make a proper backup.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should be changing the default naming of wallet databases. People have been backing up separate wallet.dats forever, and generally it works because bitcoin core leaves the wallet in consolidated state. So I'd prefer documenting that behavior instead.\r\n\r\nEven a backup with the last update stripped is better than no backup. From that it's usually possible to recover due to the mempool or HD seed. But if they can't find 'wallet.dat', they might decide not to to a backup at all.\r\n\r\nTurning the abstraction in the user's mind of wallets into directories is going to be an upstream fight as well.

Maybe it results in slightly easier backup procedures (if people interpret it correctly), but it's also more mental load (\"my wallet is just wallet.dat right?\").~~\r\n* Changing the wallet dir based on whether $DATADIR/wallets exists, that seems a bit fragile. Though it seems that's already in master?",

I think a less fragile implementation of the idea might search for existing wallets in both `<walletdir>` and `<datadir>` but create all new wallets in `<walletdir>`. This could be implemented entirely in the wallet and would avoid the init order dependencies introduced in #11466 between node, qt, and wallet code. However, I don't actually understand what was accomplished in #11466 by changing the default wallet directory to begin with, so maybe this falls short in some way. Probably better to discuss somewhere else like #11466, though, since it's not really related to this PR.",

      "body": "Sorry for the late concept feedback, but the config model seems a little confusing to me:\r\n\r\n- `datadir` defaults to `~/.bitcoin` (on linux) and can be overridden by an absolute or relative path (relative to cwd)\r\n- `walletdir` detaults to `<datadir>/wallets` if it exists, or `<datadir>` if it doesn't exist, and can be overridden by an absolute or relative path (relative to cwd)\r\n- `wallet` defaults to `<walletdir>` and can be overridden by an absolute or relative path (relative to `<walletdir>`).\r\n\r\nWithout any arguments, a wallet will be created at `<datadir>/wallets/wallet.dat` (if `<datadir>/wallets` exists) or `<datadir>/wallet.dat` (if `<datadir>/wallets` does not exist). `listwallets` and `getwalletinfo` will show this wallet's name to be `''`. If bitcoind is restarted with `--wallet=wallet.dat`, `listwallets` and `getwalletinfo` will show the same wallet's name to be `wallet.dat`.\r\n\r\nThe main points of confusion:\r\n1. `datadir` and `walletdir` paths are relative to cwd, but `wallet` is relative to `walletdir`\r\n2. `walletdir` default depends on existence of `wallets` directory in `datadir`\r\n3. wallet name can depend on how bitcoind was invoked\r\n\r\nI think (1) and (2) could be addressed with very clear documentation (I think the release notes are *almost* there, but the help text could also be improved). You could also consider disallowing relative paths for `wallet` - it could either take a string (which would refer to a .dat file or directory in `walletdir`) or an absolute path.\r\n\r\nI don't like (3) and think that the wallet name should always exactly equal the wallet file or directory.",

I definitely think some of the rough edges of that PR could be smoothed off, and have some ideas of how to simplify it, but this PR just takes the walletdir as is and doesn't change anything about how it is determined.\r\n\r\n> `listwallets` and `getwalletinfo` will show this wallet's name to be `''`. If bitcoind is restarted with `--wallet=wallet.dat`, `listwallets` and `getwalletinfo` will show the same wallet's name to be `wallet.dat`.\r\n\r\nWallet naming is simple, I think. If you specify a `-wallet=FOO` option, the wallet name is `FOO`. If you don't specify a wallet option, the wallet name is the empty string. Whatever wallet name you specify is used verbatim everywhere.\r\n\r\n>The main points of confusion:\r\n>1. `datadir` and `walletdir` paths are relative to cwd, but `wallet` is relative to `walletdir`\r\n>2. `walletdir` default depends on existence of `wallets` directory in `datadir`\r\n>3. wallet name can depend on how bitcoind was invoked\r\n>\r\n>I think (1) and (2) could be addressed with very clear documentation (I think the release notes are *almost* there, but the help text could also be improved). You could also consider disallowing relative paths for `wallet` - it could either take a string (which would refer to a .dat file or directory in `walletdir`) or an absolute path.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to write more documentation to address (1) and (2). I also think the behavior introduced in #11466 could be simplified, but that's seems more like a topic to discuss in #11466 or somewhere else.\r\n\r\n> I don't like (3) and think that the wallet name should always exactly equal the wallet file or directory.\r\n\r\nI think the wallet name should simply be whatever string the user specifies. That was the case before this PR and is still the case now. Other more complicated approaches are possible, and I wouldn't necessarily object to them, but it's not clear from your feedback here exactly what you have in mind.",

Unlike #11466, this doesn't change the location where files are created by default, so it's more backwards compatible than that change was. And despite some confusion in the comments above, I still see change and #11466 as basically orthogonal, since #11466 is more about where wallets are located, and this PR is more about how they are formatted.",

The directory can hold one or more bitcoin wallets loaded in a shared berkeleydb environment just like `-datadir` currently. #11466 also added the ability to create a `<datadir>/wallets` symlink instead of specifying a `-walletdir` option.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends #11466. It allows individual `-wallet=<name>` options to be paths, so if you have multiple wallets, they don't all have to live in the same directory and share a common berkeley db environment. It also creates new wallets (both inside and outside of `<walletdir>`) as directories instead of files, so they can be backed up independently and do not have mixed data logs.",

      "body": "> The first command on OSX creates a /home/Username/wallet directory. The second creates a directory ~ inside the default regtest wallet directory.\r\n\r\nInteresting, what appears to be happening in that example is that your shell is expanding the tilde in the first command, but not expanding the tilde in your second command. (The PR doesn't implement any tilde expansion itself.) Testing locally with bash versions 4.4.12 and 4.3.48, I don't see tildes expanded in either of these cases. Bash documentation says that it only expands tildes at the beginning of words.\r\n\r\nIn any case, apart from the inconsistent tilde expansion, the behaviour you are describing doesn't actually seem surprising to me. If you specify a new path, and bitcoin goes and creates a directory at that path, this seems like pretty much the least surprising thing you could expect. But perhaps instead of allowing both absolute paths and paths relative to `<walletdir>` generally, the implementation could be restricted to only allow either absolute paths or paths **directly** in `<walletdir>`. Other options would be to forbid special characters or dots in paths like you suggested. I tend to be somewhat skeptical of approaches like these. It's annoying when software you are trying to use has random and unnecessary restrictions on what inputs it accepts. But if there's a realistic use-case where current behaviour would be harmful or confusing, adding some restrictions could make sense. For example, luke suggested earlier (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11687#issuecomment-345448447) that paths to freestanding data files (as opposed to directories) not in `<walletdir>` could be dangerous, so these are explicitly forbidden.",

To be clear, in the thread you linked to I was arguing that paths relative to $PWD were bad because they are unstable. I don't think think paths relative to walletdir really have the same problem. I'm going to open a new PR to address the relative -walletdir issue today, and I think this should also address the inconsistency John was concerned about.\r\n\r\n> As you said, disallowing special characters doesn't seem like a good idea.

      "body": "> I mean, either the path is absolute or it's a name (which will be relative to walletdir). So anything relative (e.g. ., .., ../foo, foo/.., ...) should fail. Unless there is a use case for relative paths?\r\n\r\nThe use cases for relative paths are pretty straightforward. Maybe you want to put your watch only wallets in a different directory than your wallets with private keys. Maybe you want to have different directories for different customers, or use nested directory structure, or use symlinks to avoid hardcoding paths that may change.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure if you are concerned about relative paths, or if you are concerned about particular types of path syntax like `..` or `.`, or something else. (It might help to state the concern explicitly.) If the concern is actually allowing `..` or `.` path syntax, I guess it would be possible to add operating-system specific code to forbid it, although I don't see what the benefit would be. It seems like a good approach to take with path strings in application code is to not manipulate them directly, but just pass them through to the OS and boost path libraries so they get interpreted in a consistent way.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRebased 366c886fd7e1df95b2cdccde666eb53865e6c0c3 -> 0f090a85233dc19a059b5a69a886554f543d6bdd ([pr/wfile.30](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/wfile.30) -> [pr/wfile.31](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/wfile.31))\r\nRebased 0f090a85233dc19a059b5a69a886554f543d6bdd -> be8ab7d082228d09ca529d1a08730d7d5aacb0ed ([pr/wfile.31](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/wfile.31) -> [pr/wfile.32](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/wfile.32))",

If the server is configured to use full paths for wallet name these will be full paths, but the server has to be specifically configured this way in order for this to happen.\r\n\r\nI'm still little puzzled about what you think the underlying problem is with allowing server admins to use full paths as wallet names. But if you really think it is a problem it would literally be a one-line code change to use a different identifier. E.g. the `name` argument to `CreateWalletFromFile()` could be changed from `walletFile` to `fs::path(walletFile).filename()`.",

      "body": "> Suppose you have configured the server with an absolute wallet path. Then you have a couple of clients (in different hosts). You had to configure each client with the absolute path of the wallet. These clients can be others than bitcoin-cli. Now the server operator decides it has to move the wallet to a new location. \r\n\r\nI don't see how this is much different than the server renaming the wallet. If a server admin wants to create a stable name for a wallet, it's perfectly possible to do that by creating a symlink or just manipulating the -datadir or -walletdir (#11687) settings to be able store the wallets in different locations without changing the name. I believe this PR actually gives server admins more flexibility in this regard rather than less, because previously wallet symlinks were disallowed.\r\n\r\nBut to take the example at face value, you have a server admin who accidentally exposed a non-stable wallet name, instead of a stable wallet name over the rpc interface to clients on the internet outside of his control. What solutions would you like to see for this problem? Would it be good enough to use `fs::path(walletFile).filename()` instead of `walletFile` as the wallet name passed to `CreateWalletFromFile` like I suggested earlier? Do you want wallet names to be configurable on the command line? Do you want them to be configurable by RPC? Do you want wallet names to be stored inside wallet databases like Jonas suggested?",

If that's the goal I can make the `CWallet(name, dbw)` constructor public instead of private and get rid of the other constructors. For callers, this means the current:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(name, path)\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(CWallet::Mock())\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(CWallet::Dummy()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould become something like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(name, MakeUnique<CWalletDBWrapper>(path))\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(\"mock\", MakeUnique<CWalletDBWrapper>(CWalletDBWrapper::Mock()))\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(\"dummy\", MakeUnique<CWalletDBWrapper>(CWalletDBWrapper::Dummy()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would probably want to hold off on a change like this until `CWalletDBWrapper` did become a real abstraction. But let me know if you want this change or something along these lines. Obviously this is more verbose than code in the current pr, but it's not much more verbose than code currently in master.",

You could only resolve this by requiring all databases in the environment to be opened and closed at the same time (which would complicate dynamic loading/unloading) or by not allowing multiple databases in the same directory to be opened at the same time, or some combination these things, or just not using RAII.\r\n\r\nOn using fake \"\" path for mock databases, this is a little weird.

Even though specifying -wallet=wallet.dat (or any other filename) is still allowed for backwards compatibility, the idea here is that new wallets are directories, not files, and the `wallet.dat` filename is a implementation detail, just like the names of other files in wallet directories (`db.log`, `database/log.0000000001`).",
