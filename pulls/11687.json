    "body": "This change consists of three commits:\r\n\r\n* The first commit is a pure refactoring that removes the restriction that two wallets can only be opened at the same time if they are contained in the same directory.\r\n* The second commit removes the restriction that `-wallet` filenames can only refer to files in the `-walletdir` directory.\r\n* The third commit makes second commit a little safer by changing bitcoin to create wallet databases as directories rather than files, so they can be safely backed up.\r\n\r\nAll three commits should be straightforward:\r\n\r\n*  The first commit adds around 20 lines of new code and then updates a bunch of function signatures (generally updating them to take plain fs::path parameters, instead of combinations of strings, fs::paths, and objects like CDBEnv and CWalletDBWrapper).\r\n* The second commit removes two `-wallet` filename checks and adds some test cases to the multiwallet unit test.\r\n* The third commit just changes the mapping from specified wallet paths to bdb environment & data paths.\r\n\r\n  ---\r\n\r\n**Note:** For anybody looking at this PR for the first time, I think you can skip the comments before _20 Nov_ and start reading at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11687#issuecomment-345625565. Comments before  _20 Nov_ were about an earlier version of the PR that didn't include the third commit, and then confusion from not seeing the first commit.",

To prevent this, bitcoin spends so much time consolidating the wallet database at runtime (in the MaybeCompactWalletDB thread), and does it at least at a clean shutdown.\r\n\r\nPeople are moving around wallet.dat already, from and to the data directory, so I'm not convinced that supporting multiple wallet directories in principle makes the risk much larger that wallets are separated from their database directory while \"live\". \r\n\r\nBut indeed, a database environment has to be created where the wallets are. Creating wallets in different places or even on different file systems but having the database environment in the main data directory is asking for trouble.",

Things which might need to be considered more: \r\n- there is no 'lock' on the wallets directory, which might be needed?\r\n- because this uses a new wallets/ directory by default, downgrading to an earlier version won't see the wallets in that directory (not a big deal though, users can just copy them up to the main dir)\r\n- jnewbery suggested putting each wallet in its own directory, which is a good idea, but out of scope for this PR IMO. EDIT: this is being done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11687\r\n- doc/files.md needs updating (will do soon)\r\n\r\nI also considered including  a cleanup by removing caching of data directory paths and instead just initialise them once on startup (c.f. #3073), but decided it wasn't super relevant here will just complicate review.",

It's not clear at face value to users that the database/ directory will be created or must be maintained with the wallet file(s).\r\n\r\nNote that this was posted in response to an earlier version of this pr that did not include the third commit. With the third commit, the default for creating new wallets is as directories rather than a files (with each wallet directory containing its own wallet.dat file, db.log and database/log files). See the comments and release notes in the third commit for details.\r\n\r\n> But indeed, a database environment has to be created where the wallets are. Creating wallets in different places or even on different file systems but having the database environment in the main data directory is asking for trouble.\r\n\r\nThe PR doesn't do this (and never did). The first commit of the PR is a refactoring specifically to add support for opening multiple BDB environments.\r\n\r\n> Agree with @luke-jr, #11466 is safer until we decide on a better wallet directory structure (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11466#issuecomment-335827526), which would involve supporting multiple BDB environments first.\r\n\r\nAgain, the very first commit of this PR adds support for multiple BDB environments, and if you combine this PR with #11466 the result is exactly what you described in your linked comment.",

If you added support for multiple database environments you get my concept ACK.\r\n\r\n> Suggest renaming wallet.dat in the directory to wallet.bdb to convey the fact that you can't just copy the file to make a proper backup.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should be changing the default naming of wallet databases. People have been backing up separate wallet.dats forever, and generally it works because bitcoin core leaves the wallet in consolidated state. So I'd prefer documenting that behavior instead.\r\n\r\nEven a backup with the last update stripped is better than no backup. From that it's usually possible to recover due to the mempool or HD seed. But if they can't find 'wallet.dat', they might decide not to to a backup at all.\r\n\r\nTurning the abstraction in the user's mind of wallets into directories is going to be an upstream fight as well. I'm not against it, but I think it will result in a lot of confusion.",

The mock database environment will now go out of scope and be reset on destruction so there is no need to call BerkeleyEnvironment::Reset() during wallet construction to clear out prior state.\r\n\r\nThis change does affect bitcoin behavior slightly. On startup, instead of same wallet environments staying open throughout VerifyWallets() and OpenWallets() calls, VerifyWallets() will open and close an environment once for each wallet, and OpenWallets() will create its own environment(s) later.\r\n",

      "body": "> Two things I'm unsure about:\r\n>\r\n> - Making wallets directories. Maybe it results in slightly easier backup procedures (if people interpret it correctly), but it's also more mental load (\"my wallet is just wallet.dat right?\").\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand the point about mental load.\r\n\r\nFor typical user who isn't using multiwallet or setting any `-wallet=path` option, nothing is changing here. wallet.dat is still created in the same place as before and can be backed up the same way. For more advanced users who do specify `-wallet=<path>` options, the specified path will just be created as a directory instead of a file.\r\n\r\n> - Changing the wallet dir based on whether $DATADIR/wallets exists, that seems a bit fragile. Though it seems that's already in master?\r\n\r\nYes, this was done in #11466. I think a less fragile implementation of the idea might search for existing wallets in both `<walletdir>` and `<datadir>` but create all new wallets in `<walletdir>`. This could be implemented entirely in the wallet and would avoid the init order dependencies introduced in #11466 between node, qt, and wallet code. However, I don't actually understand what was accomplished in #11466 by changing the default wallet directory to begin with, so maybe this falls short in some way. Probably better to discuss somewhere else like #11466, though, since it's not really related to this PR.",

Unlike #11466, this doesn't change the location where files are created by default, so it's more backwards compatible than that change was. And despite some confusion in the comments above, I still see change and #11466 as basically orthogonal, since #11466 is more about where wallets are located, and this PR is more about how they are formatted.",

The directory can hold one or more bitcoin wallets loaded in a shared berkeleydb environment just like `-datadir` currently. #11466 also added the ability to create a `<datadir>/wallets` symlink instead of specifying a `-walletdir` option.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends #11466. It allows individual `-wallet=<name>` options to be paths, so if you have multiple wallets, they don't all have to live in the same directory and share a common berkeley db environment. It also creates new wallets (both inside and outside of `<walletdir>`) as directories instead of files, so they can be backed up independently and do not have mixed data logs.",

      "body": "> The first command on OSX creates a /home/Username/wallet directory. The second creates a directory ~ inside the default regtest wallet directory.\r\n\r\nInteresting, what appears to be happening in that example is that your shell is expanding the tilde in the first command, but not expanding the tilde in your second command. (The PR doesn't implement any tilde expansion itself.) Testing locally with bash versions 4.4.12 and 4.3.48, I don't see tildes expanded in either of these cases. Bash documentation says that it only expands tildes at the beginning of words.\r\n\r\nIn any case, apart from the inconsistent tilde expansion, the behaviour you are describing doesn't actually seem surprising to me. If you specify a new path, and bitcoin goes and creates a directory at that path, this seems like pretty much the least surprising thing you could expect. But perhaps instead of allowing both absolute paths and paths relative to `<walletdir>` generally, the implementation could be restricted to only allow either absolute paths or paths **directly** in `<walletdir>`. Other options would be to forbid special characters or dots in paths like you suggested. I tend to be somewhat skeptical of approaches like these. It's annoying when software you are trying to use has random and unnecessary restrictions on what inputs it accepts. But if there's a realistic use-case where current behaviour would be harmful or confusing, adding some restrictions could make sense. For example, luke suggested earlier (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11687#issuecomment-345448447) that paths to freestanding data files (as opposed to directories) not in `<walletdir>` could be dangerous, so these are explicitly forbidden.",

To be clear, in the thread you linked to I was arguing that paths relative to $PWD were bad because they are unstable. I don't think think paths relative to walletdir really have the same problem. I'm going to open a new PR to address the relative -walletdir issue today, and I think this should also address the inconsistency John was concerned about.\r\n\r\n> As you said, disallowing special characters doesn't seem like a good idea.

      "body": "> I mean, either the path is absolute or it's a name (which will be relative to walletdir). So anything relative (e.g. ., .., ../foo, foo/.., ...) should fail. Unless there is a use case for relative paths?\r\n\r\nThe use cases for relative paths are pretty straightforward. Maybe you want to put your watch only wallets in a different directory than your wallets with private keys. Maybe you want to have different directories for different customers, or use nested directory structure, or use symlinks to avoid hardcoding paths that may change.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure if you are concerned about relative paths, or if you are concerned about particular types of path syntax like `..` or `.`, or something else. (It might help to state the concern explicitly.) If the concern is actually allowing `..` or `.` path syntax, I guess it would be possible to add operating-system specific code to forbid it, although I don't see what the benefit would be. It seems like a good approach to take with path strings in application code is to not manipulate them directly, but just pass them through to the OS and boost path libraries so they get interpreted in a consistent way.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRebased 366c886fd7e1df95b2cdccde666eb53865e6c0c3 -> 0f090a85233dc19a059b5a69a886554f543d6bdd ([pr/wfile.30](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/wfile.30) -> [pr/wfile.31](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/wfile.31))\r\nRebased 0f090a85233dc19a059b5a69a886554f543d6bdd -> be8ab7d082228d09ca529d1a08730d7d5aacb0ed ([pr/wfile.31](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/wfile.31) -> [pr/wfile.32](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/wfile.32))",

          "title": "wallet: Refactor the classes in wallet/db.{cpp/h}",
          "body": "The data storage layer of the wallet is fairly complicated and not well encapsulated or modularized. This makes it difficult for us to introduce new data storage methods. So this PR refactors it such that there is a clear way to introduce other storage options. This is also intended to clean up the logic of the database layer so that it is easier to follow and reason about.\r\n\r\nIn the database, there are 3 classes: `BerkeleyBatch`, `BerkeleyDatabase`, and `BerkeleyEnvironment`. `BerkeleyDatabase` is typenamed to `WalletDatabase`. The goal is to introduce two abstract classes: `WalletDatabase` and `DatabaseBatch`. These will be implemented by `BerkeleyDatabase` and `BerkeleyBatch`. This abstract classes can be inherited by other storage methods. All of the database specific things should be hidden in those classes.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we move the database handling things in `BerkeleyBatch` and turn it purely into a data accessor for the `BerkeleyDatabase`. Particularly, various static functions that operated on a `BerkeleyDatabase` are changed to be member functions of `BerkeleyDatabase`. `Read`, `Write`, `Erase`, and `Exists` are refactored to have separate functions that can be overridden by other classes. Instead of `GetCursor` returning a BDB specific `Dbc` object, new `CreateCursor` and `CloseCursor` functions are added and the cursor is handled internally within the `BerkeleyBatch`. We are then able to introduce the `DatabaseBatch` abstract class.\r\n\r\nFunctionality is further moved out of `BerkeleyBatch` into `BerkeleyDatabase`. Notably the `Db` handle creation is moved from `BerkeleyBatch`'s constructor and to a new `Open` function in `BerkeleyDatabase`. `BerkeleyDatabase` will also handle closing with a new `Close` function instead of having this be part of `Flush`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the existence of `BerkeleyEnvironment` is hidden inside of `BerkeleyDatabase`. `mapFileUseCount` is removed. Instead `WalletDatabase` will track it's use count with `m_refcount`. This is incremented by newly introduced `AddRef` and `RemoveRef` functions. `m_refcount` is used to ensure that the database and environment are not closed while the database may still be in use.\r\n\r\nInstead of each `BerkeleyEnvironment` tracking the fileids of the databases in that environment, a global map `g_fileids` is used. Since we were already going through every open fileid for the uniqeness check, it doesn't matter what `BerkeleyEnvironment` has a database with a particular fileid. All we care about is that there is a database in any of the environments that has the same fileid of the database that is currently being opened.\r\n\r\nLastly, `BerkeleyBatch, `BerkeleyDatabase`, and `BerkeleyEnvironment` are moved into new files `wallet/bdb.{cpp/h}`. `WalletDatabase` and `DatabaseBatch` are in `wallet/db.{cpp/h}`. This just gives better organization of the code so they aren't all mixed together.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI've started breaking this down into separate PRs. Some of the simpler stuff is moved up to the front so they can be merged first.\r\n\r\n* [x] Mostly simple moveonly things: #19290\r\n  * walletdb: Make SpliWalletFilePath non-static\r\n  * walletdb: Add IsBDBWalletLoaded to look for BDB wallets specifically\r\n  * walletdb: move IsWalletLoaded to walletdb.cpp\r\n  * walletdb: moveonly: Move BerkeleyBatch Cursor and Txn funcs to cpp\r\n  * walletdb: Move BDB specific things into bdb.{cpp/h}\r\n\r\nThese PRs are independent of each other and can be merged out of order after #19290 is merged\r\n* [x] Refactor Read, Write, Erase, Exists: #19292\r\n  * walletdb: refactor Read, Write, Erase, and Exists into non-template func\r\n* [x] Handle cursor internally: #19308\r\n  * walletdb: Handle cursor internally\r\n* [x] Make Create, CreateMock, and CreateDummy standalone: #19310\r\n  * Add Create*WalletDatabase functions\r\n  * scripted-diff: Replace WalletDatabase::Create* with CreateWalletDatabase\r\n  * Remove WalletDatabase::Create, CreateMock, and CreateDummy\r\n* [x] Move BerkeleyBatch static functions: #19324\r\n  * walletdb: Combine VerifyDatabaseFile and VerifyEnvironment\r\n  * walletdb: Move PeriodicFlush into WalletDatabase\r\n  * walletdb: Move Rewrite into BerkeleyDatabase\r\n\r\nThese PRs require the previous listed to be merged first and need to be merged in order\r\n* [x] Introduce `DatabaseBatch`: #19325\r\n  * walletdb: Refactor DatabaseBatch abstract class from BerkeleyBatch\r\n  * walletdb: Add MakeBatch function to BerkeleyDatabase and use it\r\n* [x] Introduce `WalletDatabase`: #19334\r\n  * walletdb: Move BerkeleyDatabase::Flush(true) to Close()\r\n  * walletdb: Introduce AddRef and RemoveRef functions\r\n  * walletdb: Add BerkeleyDatabase::Open dummy function\r\n  * walletdb: Introduce WalletDatabase abstract class\r\n* [ ] Cleanup the separation: #19335\r\n  * walletdb: track database file use as m_refcount within BerkeleyDatabase\r\n  * walletdb: Move Db->open to BerkeleyDatabase::Open\r\n  * walletdb: Use a global g_fileids instead of m_fileids for each env\r\n  * walletdb: Remove BerkeleyBatch friend class from BerkeleyDatabase\r\n\r\nI will continue to break this down as things get merged.",

          "title": "wallet: Add sqlite as an alternative wallet database and use it for new descriptor wallets",
          "body": "This PR adds a new class `SQLiteDatabase` which is a subclass of `WalletDatabase`. This provides access to a SQLite database that is used to store the wallet records. To keep compatibility with BDB and to complexity of the change down, we don't make use of many SQLite's features. We use it strictly as a key-value store. We create a table `main` which has two columns, `key` and `value` both with the type `blob`.\r\n\r\nFor new descriptor wallets, we will create a `SQLiteDatabase` instead of a `BerkeleyDatabase`. There is no requirement that all SQLite wallets are descriptor wallets, nor is there a requirement that all descriptor wallets be SQLite wallets. This allows for existing descriptor wallets to work as well as keeping open the option to migrate existing wallets to SQLite.\r\n\r\nWe keep the name `wallet.dat` for SQLite wallets. We are able to determine which database type to use by searching for specific magic bytes in the `wallet.dat` file. SQLite begins it's files with a null terminated string `SQLite format 3`. BDB has `0x00053162` at byte 12 (note that the byte order of this integer depends on the system endianness). So when we see that there is a `wallet.dat` file that we want to open, we check for the magic bytes to determine which database system to use.\r\n\r\nI decided to keep the `wallet.dat` naming to keep things like backup script to continue to function as they won't need to be modified to look for a different file name. It also simplifies a couple of things in the implementation and the tests as `wallet.dat` is something that is specifically being looked for. If we don't want this behavior, then I do have another branch which creates `wallet.sqlite` files instead, but I find that this direction is easier.",

          "body": "> Adding more flexibility in where the wallets directory can be located. Before, the wallet database files were stored at the top level of the PIVX data directory. Now the location of the wallets directory can be overridden by specifying a `-walletdir=<path>` option where `<path>` can be an absolute path to a directory or directory symlink.\r\n>\r\n>Another advantage of this change is that if two wallets are located in the same directory, they will now use their own BerkeleyDB environments instead using a shared environment. Using a shared environment makes it difficult to manage and back up wallets separately because transaction log files will contain a mix of data from all wallets in the environment.\r\n\r\nComing from:\r\n* #11351 -> Refactor: Modernize disallowed copy constructors/assignment.\r\n* #11466 -> Specify custom wallet directory with -walletdir param.\r\n* #11726 -> Cleanups + nit fixes for -walletdir work.\r\n* #11904 -> Add lock to the wallet directory.\r\n* #11687 -> External wallet files support.\r\n* #12166 -> Doc better -walletdir description.\r\n* #12220 -> Error if relative -walletdir is specified.\r\n\r\nThis finishes the work started in #2337, enabling all the commented tests inside `wallet_multiwallet.py` and more.\r\n\r\nPR built on top of #2369.\r\n\r\nNote: Test this properly.",

We've discussed adding and storing wallet identifiers in the past, but opted to just use filenames for simplicity. Server operator is free to choose a path, or alias or whatever he wants as the string used to identify the wallet.",

If the server is configured to use full paths for wallet name these will be full paths, but the server has to be specifically configured this way in order for this to happen.\r\n\r\nI'm still little puzzled about what you think the underlying problem is with allowing server admins to use full paths as wallet names. But if you really think it is a problem it would literally be a one-line code change to use a different identifier. E.g. the `name` argument to `CreateWalletFromFile()` could be changed from `walletFile` to `fs::path(walletFile).filename()`.",

You had to configure each client with the absolute path of the wallet. These clients can be others than bitcoin-cli. Now the server operator decides it has to move the wallet to a new location. \r\n\r\nI don't see how this is much different than the server renaming the wallet. If a server admin wants to create a stable name for a wallet, it's perfectly possible to do that by creating a symlink or just manipulating the -datadir or -walletdir (#11687) settings to be able store the wallets in different locations without changing the name. I believe this PR actually gives server admins more flexibility in this regard rather than less, because previously wallet symlinks were disallowed.\r\n\r\nBut to take the example at face value, you have a server admin who accidentally exposed a non-stable wallet name, instead of a stable wallet name over the rpc interface to clients on the internet outside of his control. What solutions would you like to see for this problem? Would it be good enough to use `fs::path(walletFile).filename()` instead of `walletFile` as the wallet name passed to `CreateWalletFromFile` like I suggested earlier? Do you want wallet names to be configurable on the command line? Do you want them to be configurable by RPC? Do you want wallet names to be stored inside wallet databases like Jonas suggested?",

If that's the goal I can make the `CWallet(name, dbw)` constructor public instead of private and get rid of the other constructors. For callers, this means the current:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(name, path)\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(CWallet::Mock())\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(CWallet::Dummy()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould become something like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(name, MakeUnique<CWalletDBWrapper>(path))\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(\"mock\", MakeUnique<CWalletDBWrapper>(CWalletDBWrapper::Mock()))\r\nMakeUnique<CWallet>(\"dummy\", MakeUnique<CWalletDBWrapper>(CWalletDBWrapper::Dummy()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would probably want to hold off on a change like this until `CWalletDBWrapper` did become a real abstraction. But let me know if you want this change or something along these lines. Obviously this is more verbose than code in the current pr, but it's not much more verbose than code currently in master.",

In the future I kinda feel like it should become more RAII (ie Open in the GetWalletEnv call) but not in this PR.\r\n\r\nRAII is not the model this uses because when there more than one wallet file open in the same directory they share the same environment. You could only resolve this by requiring all databases in the environment to be opened and closed at the same time (which would complicate dynamic loading/unloading) or by not allowing multiple databases in the same directory to be opened at the same time, or some combination these things, or just not using RAII.\r\n\r\nOn using fake \"\" path for mock databases, this is a little weird. Could be made less exposed by  adding a separate constructor for mocks like proposed in the other comment: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11687#discussion_r155371642",

If you do specify a `-wallet` option, whatever value you pass will be the wallet name.\r\n\r\nI think listing wallet.dat as the default name would not be good. Even though specifying -wallet=wallet.dat (or any other filename) is still allowed for backwards compatibility, the idea here is that new wallets are directories, not files, and the `wallet.dat` filename is a implementation detail, just like the names of other files in wallet directories (`db.log`, `database/log.0000000001`).",
