    "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections, or to IPv4/IPv6 peers but through the Tor network.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * opened to Tor or I2P peers or IPv4/IPv6 via the Tor proxy\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few peers. Keep doing this until we receive back this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from one of our ordinary peers, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>High-level explanation of the commits</summary>\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n  * `test: move create_malleated_version() to messages.py for reuse`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFurther extensions of this planned for subsequent PRs:\r\n* Have the wallet do the private broadcast as well, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11887 would have to be resolved.\r\n* Add some stats via RPC, so that the user can better monitor what is going on during and after the broadcast. Currently this can be done via the debug log, but that is not convenient.\r\n* Make the private broadcast storage, currently in peerman, persistent over node restarts.\r\n* Add (optional) random delay before starting to broadcast the transaction in order to avoid correlating unrelated transactions based on the time when they were broadcast. Suggested independently of this PR [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30471).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

      "body": "@1440000bytes, thanks for asking! There is some discussion at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509 (the previous attempt on this).\r\n\r\n> Is it necessary to open new short lived tor/i2p connections for broadcasting the transaction?\r\n\r\nYes, it is. See below.\r\n\r\n> What are the trade-offs in this implementation vs a simple implementation to relay tx to one or more peers that our node is already connected to?\r\n\r\nSending the transaction over clearnet reveals the IP address/geolocation of the sender. A spy with many connections to the network could try to guess who was the originator. So, why not send it to our Tor peers only? Because it is relatively easy for a spy to fingerprint and link clearnet and Tor connections to the same peer. That is, a long running connection over Tor could be linked to a long running clearnet connection. This is why the proposed changes open a short-lived connection that does not reveal any of the identity of the sender.\r\n\r\nWould this benefit nodes that don't have clearnet connections, e.g. Tor/I2P-only nodes? Yes! In the case where the sender sends two otherwise unrelated transactions over the same long-running Tor connection, the recipient will know that they have the same origin, even though they are not related on-chain. Using single shot connections fixes that too.\r\n\r\n> Related issues:\r\n\r\nLinked in the OP, thanks!",

Currently using a 20-node [graph](https://github.com/pinheadmz/warnet/blob/priv-broadcast/test/data/onion.graphml) and a [scenario](https://github.com/pinheadmz/warnet/blob/priv-broadcast/src/scenarios/onion_init.py) which connects the graph, adds onion addresses to the test node, and then sends a raw transaction from the node running this branch.\r\n\r\nThe private broadcast succeeds frequently but not always. In Warnet anyway I had better luck when the test node had `-listenonion=0`, I tried that after suspecting that inbound onion connections were removing potential peers from the private broadcast list, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nI think I noticed this in the original PR as well, if multiple transactions are sent, the count keeps going up without a limit: \r\n\r\n```\r\n [privatebroadcast] Requested to open 60 connection(s), trying to open one\r\n```\r\n\r\nScreenshot below, I managed to capture a private broadcast connection! I'll mention when i get to that commit in review as well, but the connection type `\"privbcast\"` is breaking the very nice `-netinfo` table :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far I have a few questions about the strategy:\r\n\r\n1. How do we pick the onion peers to relay to? If we avoid reusing peers then (especially in my miniature network) we can run out quickly, and nothing ever gets broadcast.\r\n\r\n2. Are we using fresh Tor identities for these connections? I think [Wasabi does something like this:](https://docs.wasabiwallet.app/why-wasabi/NetworkLevelPrivacy.html)\r\n\r\n> Wasabi connects to each peer through a different Tor stream. \r\n\r\n3. Do you think we need any RPC to get the status of private tx sends or provide the option to abandon (or revert to clearnet?)\r\n\r\n4. I assume you are restricting the feature to sendraw so the wallet doesn't get involved and try something silly like rebroadcasting over clearnet or inserting in to our own mempool? Do you think future work will integrate the wallet?\r\n\r\n\r\n![privbroadcast](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/2084648/ec172be1-e5d8-4c00-94fc-e219dccacdec)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@pinheadmz, excellent! Thank you for looking into this! Replies inline:\r\n\r\n> The private broadcast succeeds frequently but not always\r\n\r\nLets debug this in a sub-thread in order not to overwhelm the PR main thread: [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415/files#r1519402830).\r\n\r\n> suspecting that inbound onion connections were removing potential peers from the private broadcast list\r\n\r\nNo, this cannot be the case. Inbound onion connections appear as IPv4 connections coming from the Tor daemon. They do not have any source address associated with them, other than the one of the Tor daemon itself (usually `127.0.0.1`).\r\n\r\n> I think I noticed this in the original PR as well, if multiple transactions are sent, the count keeps going up without a limit\r\n\r\nThat is now capped at `size_t MAX_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_CONNECTIONS{64}`.\r\n\r\n> the connection type `\"privbcast\"` is breaking the very nice `-netinfo` table\r\n\r\nThis better be addressed in the visualization engine, e.g. by using `%5.5s`\r\n\r\n> How do we pick the onion peers to relay to? If we avoid reusing peers then...\r\n\r\nWe pick a random Tor (or I2P) peer. In the same way we choose the address when we want to have an outbound connection to a peer from a particular network. No attempt to avoid reuse. But we don't connect to already connected peers. This is the logic as in `master`.\r\n\r\n> Are we using fresh Tor identities for these connections?\r\n\r\nYes, if `-proxyrandomize=1` (the default). This is the same in `master` - separate Tor circuit per connection. This PR does the same as Wasabi: https://docs.wasabiwallet.app/why-wasabi/NetworkLevelPrivacy.html#wasabi-wallet-light-node\r\n\r\n> Do you think we need any RPC to get the status of private tx sends or provide the option to abandon (or revert to clearnet?)\r\n\r\nYes, both would be useful, but as a followup PR. I am afraid putting those here would bloat this PR too much. I could however implement that and publish it under Draft PR that depends on this one, so people can use it during testing.\r\n\r\n> I assume you are restricting the feature to sendraw so the wallet doesn't get involved and try something silly like rebroadcasting over clearnet or inserting in to our own mempool?\r\n\r\nThe reason to omit the wallet is that it currently does not count non-mempool change. For example, if we have 1 BTC and send 0.6 to somebody and 0.4 as change, the wallet will show a balance of 0 (or 1, unchanged? somebody correct me if I am wrong) until the transaction enters the mempool (or gets mined in a block). This would be quite rough user experience. Note that this is already the case in `master` if `-walletbroadcast=0`.\r\n\r\n> Do you think future work will integrate the wallet?\r\n\r\nYes, but I left that for another PR. Omitting it here reduces the size of this PR and allows to deal with the wallet in isolation, after all the distracting infrastructure is in (e.g. log category, new type of connection, the \"net\" code, etc).\r\n",

For now I am keeping it as it is, but if you are happy with all the rest and would otherwise ACK, then say so! ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks. I read through the proposal to not accept unsolicited `TX` messages, and the reasoning to reject it makes sense to me. I suppose if you know you're the originator of a tx, the only reason *not* to push the tx unsolicited to all your peers is for privacy reasons. However, in this case the privacy reasons are moot because of the ephemeral private connections.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > Also, if the submitted tx is spending unconfirmed outputs, should we support sending the parents to the peer if requested?\r\n> \r\n> Right now in `master` `sendrawtransaction` RPC operates on a single transaction. Its parents must already be in the mempool. This PR keeps it that way. Parent+child is more for the `submitpackage` RPC. That + the wallet I will deal with in a followup PRs.\r\n\r\nI mean the case where we have a parent unconfirmed tx in our mempool, and the peer we connected to does not. If we push a tx spending that unconfirmed parent, the peer will respond with a `GETDATA` for the parent tx. So we can either:\r\n1. Ignore the `GETDATA` . This will result in our tx not relaying through this connection if the peer doesn't have all unconfirmed parents.\r\n2. Wait for the `GETDATA` and respond with a `TX` message. We won't know if the peer will eventually ask for the parent, so this will be tricky and we will have to wait for some time. However, in this time if we receive an `INV` for it from another peer we can close because we know we were successful.\r\n3. Push all unconfirmed parents along with the tx we are sending. This will result in potentially wasted bandwidth.\r\n",

Others should succeed. If \"nobody\" has the parent in their mempool, then somehow we are trying to broadcast an orphaned transaction with parent(s) not seen by the network.

This is the same in `master` - separate Tor circuit per connection.\r\n\r\nIf this is not the case and a peer to which a long lived connection already exists is selected again, then tor will multiplex both connections on the same established circuit, which means that the two connections are unambiguously correlated.\r\n\r\nAvoiding already connected peers would work around this, but perhaps it's sufficient just to warn on startup if `privatebroadcast=1` and `proxyrandomize=0`, since that is unlikely to be configured (requires opt out & opt in), and unlikely to be an issue even if it is configured since a malicious peer would need to be selected twice.\r\n\r\nThis would be less of a concern if clearnet hosts are also allowed, since the likelyhood of selecting the same peer diminishes quadratically in the size of the set of potential peers.\r\n\r\n> > I assume you are restricting the feature to sendraw so the wallet doesn't get involved and try something silly like rebroadcasting over clearnet or inserting in to our own mempool?\r\n> \r\n> The reason to omit the wallet is that it currently does not count non-mempool change.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, the concern with rebroadcasting still applies, but in the case that private broadcast was successful?",

This means that we are not ready to open other connection types. In this case and if private broadcast is needed, proceed with private broadcast even if the previous connection was private broadcast as well. This simplifies `ShouldOpen()` as the logic \"previous was private broadcast\" is moved to the caller.\r\n\r\n* Rename `tor_proxy` to `proxy_for_ipv4or6` and actually set it, it's used only for logging.\r\n\r\n* Run transactions to be broadcast through mempool acceptance test, they were not before.\r\n\r\n* If the same transaction is repeatedly given to `sendrawtransaction` RPC, then don't open 5 new private broadcast connections every time. Change subsequent requests to do nothing but log a message that it was not necessary to `sendrawtransaction` the transaction again.\r\n\r\n* Change the extension of the SOCKS5 proxy - instead of being given a set of predefined destinations to redirect the connections to, it is now given a callback function which returns the destination where to redirect, or it can decide to return `None` asking the SOCKS5 proxy to close the connection (default behavior). This is more flexible.\r\n\r\n* Move `create_malleated_version()` from `p2p_orphan_handling.py` to `test_framework/messages.py` where it can be reused.\r\n\r\n* Extend the functional tests as per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415#discussion_r1663040526, thanks @instagibbs for the suggestions!\r\n",

Other options I mentioned in that comment:\r\n\r\n> We do have a choice where about where to put public types which are not really part of any library. We can put them in the interfaces directory, or in common, or in the node and wallet directories. Personally, I think it makes sense to put them in the wallet directory when they are related to wallet functionality and used by wallet code, put them in the node directory when they are related to node functionality and used by node code, put them in the common directory when they are related to common functionality (like PSBT) and used by common code. The comments at the top of {node,wallet,common}/types.h files are meant to explain the idea that these are public types.",

This specific optimization does introduce a censorship risk (even if BIP 324 is used [edit: *due*] to the MITM consideration) and there precedent for such malicious exit nodes.\r\n\r\nFrom a privacy standpoint both optimizations would be more or less equivalent to broadcasting through isolated connections to peers with hidden service addresses, since the origin is still protected and being able to link these connections does not aid in deanonymization since these connections all pertain to the same data.\r\n\r\nThe main rationale for these optimizations is that Tor daemon builds circuits sequentially, and does not keep many built circuits in reserve (IIRC 2 unless their construction is explicitly requested through the control socket), so when SOCKS connections are opened with distinct credentials the connection establishment and time to first byte will typically scale linearly in the order that the SOCKS connections are accepted by tor daemon itself, and since building a new circuit can take on the order of seconds.",

I could complicate the fuzz tests to avoid sending unwanted messages if the random node happens to be a private broadcast, but `CConnman::PushMessage()` is called from a lot of places including from the RPC and that may change in the future as well. It is somewhat hard to judge that nobody will call `PushMessage()` with an unwanted message. Thus I think it is better to assume that this is the real check here in `CConnman::PushMessage()` and that the one in `PeerManagerImpl::SendMessages()` is an optimization.

We choose not to use our permanent `m_i2p_sam_session` to avoid linking this to our permanent I2P ID, however, we use a pool of transient I2P sessions (`m_unused_i2p_sessions`) instead. I understand these transient sessions can be reused (or at least that's what I get from the docs of `m_unused_i2p_sessions`). So if the same `(peer, session_id)` pair is picked, the node will know that we created both transactions, wouldn't it?",

We come to this code and see that tx1 has been broadcast two times and deduce that the other 5-2=3 we created are not needed and call `PrivateBroadcastSub(3)`. `m_private_broadcast_connections_to_open` should be set to 11-3=8 (4 for tx2 and 4 for tx3), not 0.",

It feels harder to reason about, but I don't see what the benefit of it is.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that it is simpler to implement that way (I think, somebody has a simpler proposal?). This is because the connman thread is creating the connections, they are consumed/used by the peerman thread and the requests for new connections can come from yet another (3rd) thread. For example, while connman is creating a new connection which is needed to broadcast a given transaction, that transaction may be successfully broadcast by peerman and received back from the network, rendering the just created new connection by connman unnecessary. This is harmless and I accept it because avoiding it would make things too complicated or slow.\r\n",

One in ConnMan and one in its own unit, used in PeerManager.\r\n\r\nI dunno if there's a cleaner approach available, to ensure that the two objects don't get out of sync? Like instead of `m_num_to_open` in ConnMan, could you refer to the size of the `ByNodeId` map?",

Would be nice to add one more test with a valid but different witness.\r\n\r\n>     4. sending a tx with in-mempool dependencies (both that succeed and fail due to existing/missing parent)\r\n\r\nDone, both.\r\n\r\n>     5. rpc failing if it detects `!g_reachable_nets`\r\n\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n>     6. what happens if there's not enough private connections when first broadcast attempt is tried, but more found later\r\n\r\nPrivate broadcast connections are created on demand. When first broadcast attempt is tried they are 0 (I did not add new test).\r\n\r\n>     7. what happens to pending broadcasts on restart of node\r\n\r\nThey are lost. Persistence over restart is not in this PR, but will be in a subsequent one (I did not add new test).",
