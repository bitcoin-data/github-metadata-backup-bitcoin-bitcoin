    "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections, or to IPv4/IPv6 peers but through the Tor network.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * opened to Tor or I2P peers or IPv4/IPv6 via the Tor proxy\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few peers. Keep doing this until we receive back this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from one of our ordinary peers, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- INV/TX --------> tx-recipient (if we take the last commit: fixup!)\r\ntx-sender <--- GETDATA/TX ----< tx-recipient (if we take the last commit: fixup!)\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>High-level explanation of the commits</summary>\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n  * `test: move create_malleated_version() to messages.py for reuse`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFurther extensions of this planned for subsequent PRs:\r\n* Have the wallet do the private broadcast as well, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11887 would have to be resolved.\r\n* Add some stats via RPC, so that the user can better monitor what is going on during and after the broadcast. Currently this can be done via the debug log, but that is not convenient.\r\n* Make the private broadcast storage, currently in peerman, persistent over node restarts.\r\n* Add (optional) random delay before starting to broadcast the transaction in order to avoid correlating unrelated transactions based on the time when they were broadcast. Suggested independently of this PR [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30471).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

      "body": "@1440000bytes, thanks for asking! There is some discussion at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509 (the previous attempt on this).\r\n\r\n> Is it necessary to open new short lived tor/i2p connections for broadcasting the transaction?\r\n\r\nYes, it is. See below.\r\n\r\n> What are the trade-offs in this implementation vs a simple implementation to relay tx to one or more peers that our node is already connected to?\r\n\r\nSending the transaction over clearnet reveals the IP address/geolocation of the sender. A spy with many connections to the network could try to guess who was the originator. So, why not send it to our Tor peers only? Because it is relatively easy for a spy to fingerprint and link clearnet and Tor connections to the same peer. That is, a long running connection over Tor could be linked to a long running clearnet connection. This is why the proposed changes open a short-lived connection that does not reveal any of the identity of the sender.\r\n\r\nWould this benefit nodes that don't have clearnet connections, e.g. Tor/I2P-only nodes? Yes! In the case where the sender sends two otherwise unrelated transactions over the same long-running Tor connection, the recipient will know that they have the same origin, even though they are not related on-chain. Using single shot connections fixes that too.\r\n\r\n> Related issues:\r\n\r\nLinked in the OP, thanks!",

      "body": "concept ACK 6fad02cf03 \r\n\r\n(code review in progress)\r\n\r\nI am also testing this feature in Warnet, which deploys a regtest network and even has an internal Tor DA so I can simulate onion routing locally. Currently using a 20-node [graph](https://github.com/pinheadmz/warnet/blob/priv-broadcast/test/data/onion.graphml) and a [scenario](https://github.com/pinheadmz/warnet/blob/priv-broadcast/src/scenarios/onion_init.py) which connects the graph, adds onion addresses to the test node, and then sends a raw transaction from the node running this branch.\r\n\r\nThe private broadcast succeeds frequently but not always. In Warnet anyway I had better luck when the test node had `-listenonion=0`, I tried that after suspecting that inbound onion connections were removing potential peers from the private broadcast list, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nI think I noticed this in the original PR as well, if multiple transactions are sent, the count keeps going up without a limit: \r\n\r\n```\r\n [privatebroadcast] Requested to open 60 connection(s), trying to open one\r\n```\r\n\r\nScreenshot below, I managed to capture a private broadcast connection! I'll mention when i get to that commit in review as well, but the connection type `\"privbcast\"` is breaking the very nice `-netinfo` table :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far I have a few questions about the strategy:\r\n\r\n1. How do we pick the onion peers to relay to? If we avoid reusing peers then (especially in my miniature network) we can run out quickly, and nothing ever gets broadcast.\r\n\r\n2. Are we using fresh Tor identities for these connections? I think [Wasabi does something like this:](https://docs.wasabiwallet.app/why-wasabi/NetworkLevelPrivacy.html)\r\n\r\n> Wasabi connects to each peer through a different Tor stream. \r\n\r\n3. Do you think we need any RPC to get the status of private tx sends or provide the option to abandon (or revert to clearnet?)\r\n\r\n4. I assume you are restricting the feature to sendraw so the wallet doesn't get involved and try something silly like rebroadcasting over clearnet or inserting in to our own mempool? Do you think future work will integrate the wallet?\r\n\r\n\r\n![privbroadcast](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/2084648/ec172be1-e5d8-4c00-94fc-e219dccacdec)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@pinheadmz, excellent! Thank you for looking into this! Replies inline:\r\n\r\n> The private broadcast succeeds frequently but not always\r\n\r\nLets debug this in a sub-thread in order not to overwhelm the PR main thread: [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415/files#r1519402830).\r\n\r\n> suspecting that inbound onion connections were removing potential peers from the private broadcast list\r\n\r\nNo, this cannot be the case. Inbound onion connections appear as IPv4 connections coming from the Tor daemon. They do not have any source address associated with them, other than the one of the Tor daemon itself (usually `127.0.0.1`).\r\n\r\n> I think I noticed this in the original PR as well, if multiple transactions are sent, the count keeps going up without a limit\r\n\r\nThat is now capped at `size_t MAX_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_CONNECTIONS{64}`.\r\n\r\n> the connection type `\"privbcast\"` is breaking the very nice `-netinfo` table\r\n\r\nThis better be addressed in the visualization engine, e.g. by using `%5.5s`\r\n\r\n> How do we pick the onion peers to relay to? If we avoid reusing peers then...\r\n\r\nWe pick a random Tor (or I2P) peer. In the same way we choose the address when we want to have an outbound connection to a peer from a particular network. No attempt to avoid reuse. But we don't connect to already connected peers. This is the logic as in `master`.\r\n\r\n> Are we using fresh Tor identities for these connections?\r\n\r\nYes, if `-proxyrandomize=1` (the default). This is the same in `master` - separate Tor circuit per connection. This PR does the same as Wasabi: https://docs.wasabiwallet.app/why-wasabi/NetworkLevelPrivacy.html#wasabi-wallet-light-node\r\n\r\n> Do you think we need any RPC to get the status of private tx sends or provide the option to abandon (or revert to clearnet?)\r\n\r\nYes, both would be useful, but as a followup PR. I am afraid putting those here would bloat this PR too much. I could however implement that and publish it under Draft PR that depends on this one, so people can use it during testing.\r\n\r\n> I assume you are restricting the feature to sendraw so the wallet doesn't get involved and try something silly like rebroadcasting over clearnet or inserting in to our own mempool?\r\n\r\nThe reason to omit the wallet is that it currently does not count non-mempool change. For example, if we have 1 BTC and send 0.6 to somebody and 0.4 as change, the wallet will show a balance of 0 (or 1, unchanged? somebody correct me if I am wrong) until the transaction enters the mempool (or gets mined in a block). This would be quite rough user experience. Note that this is already the case in `master` if `-walletbroadcast=0`.\r\n\r\n> Do you think future work will integrate the wallet?\r\n\r\nYes, but I left that for another PR. Omitting it here reduces the size of this PR and allows to deal with the wallet in isolation, after all the distracting infrastructure is in (e.g. log category, new type of connection, the \"net\" code, etc).\r\n",

For now I am keeping it as it is, but if you are happy with all the rest and would otherwise ACK, then say so! ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks. I read through the proposal to not accept unsolicited `TX` messages, and the reasoning to reject it makes sense to me. I suppose if you know you're the originator of a tx, the only reason *not* to push the tx unsolicited to all your peers is for privacy reasons. However, in this case the privacy reasons are moot because of the ephemeral private connections.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > Also, if the submitted tx is spending unconfirmed outputs, should we support sending the parents to the peer if requested?\r\n> \r\n> Right now in `master` `sendrawtransaction` RPC operates on a single transaction. Its parents must already be in the mempool. This PR keeps it that way. Parent+child is more for the `submitpackage` RPC. That + the wallet I will deal with in a followup PRs.\r\n\r\nI mean the case where we have a parent unconfirmed tx in our mempool, and the peer we connected to does not. If we push a tx spending that unconfirmed parent, the peer will respond with a `GETDATA` for the parent tx. So we can either:\r\n1. Ignore the `GETDATA` . This will result in our tx not relaying through this connection if the peer doesn't have all unconfirmed parents.\r\n2. Wait for the `GETDATA` and respond with a `TX` message. We won't know if the peer will eventually ask for the parent, so this will be tricky and we will have to wait for some time. However, in this time if we receive an `INV` for it from another peer we can close because we know we were successful.\r\n3. Push all unconfirmed parents along with the tx we are sending. This will result in potentially wasted bandwidth.\r\n",

If we push a tx spending that unconfirmed parent, the peer will respond with a `GETDATA` for the parent tx...\r\n\r\nI will keep it simple stupid for now, meaning that in this case that particular peer will not relay the transaction further. Others should succeed. If \"nobody\" has the parent in their mempool, then somehow we are trying to broadcast an orphaned transaction with parent(s) not seen by the network.

This means that we are not ready to open other connection types. In this case and if private broadcast is needed, proceed with private broadcast even if the previous connection was private broadcast as well. This simplifies `ShouldOpen()` as the logic \"previous was private broadcast\" is moved to the caller.\r\n\r\n* Rename `tor_proxy` to `proxy_for_ipv4or6` and actually set it, it's used only for logging.\r\n\r\n* Run transactions to be broadcast through mempool acceptance test, they were not before.\r\n\r\n* If the same transaction is repeatedly given to `sendrawtransaction` RPC, then don't open 5 new private broadcast connections every time. Change subsequent requests to do nothing but log a message that it was not necessary to `sendrawtransaction` the transaction again.\r\n\r\n* Change the extension of the SOCKS5 proxy - instead of being given a set of predefined destinations to redirect the connections to, it is now given a callback function which returns the destination where to redirect, or it can decide to return `None` asking the SOCKS5 proxy to close the connection (default behavior). This is more flexible.\r\n\r\n* Move `create_malleated_version()` from `p2p_orphan_handling.py` to `test_framework/messages.py` where it can be reused.\r\n\r\n* Extend the functional tests as per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415#discussion_r1663040526, thanks @instagibbs for the suggestions!\r\n",

      "body": "Private broadcast can also reduce privacy.  I think the weakness is a tossup vs the obvious alternative (run ordinary connections exclusively over Tor) so it's not a reason to not implement the feature, but it's worth discussing in order to understand the limits and see if mitigations are possible.\r\n\r\nThe issue on my mind is that Tor has little to no resistance to traffic analysis. The small amount of resistance it has is by quantizing messages into fixed size cells.   Otherwise, it essentially doesn't have much resistance because analysis resistance is incompatible with achieving low latency.  Too bad for us because for txn broadcast latency is fairly irrelevant.\r\n\r\nWe assume the attacker is able to passively monitor the internet connection of our victim.  Lets also assume their non-blocksonly Bitcoin P2P connection is encrypted as is increasingly so (and it's a ~6 line change to add an option to make peer v2-only, which I assume someone will propose once they feel v2 listeners are widespread enough).\r\n\r\nThe attacker is attempting to confirm that the monitored peer is the originator of specific transactions on the network, or alternatively is looking at all the transactions and try to determine which are likely authored by the monitored peer.\r\n\r\nAgainst *this* threat model, I think this PR creates a substantial weakness compared to not having it:  any time the user transacts they will create a predictable amount of traffic to tor which is a somewhat a function of the size of the transaction.  There may be enough noise that a single transaction isn't enough alone, but someone who transacted a couple times a day would likely be identifiable.\r\n\r\nOf course, this isn't the threat model this PR really hopes to address. This PR is strong against a threat model where the attacker cannot traffic analyze anyone but instead runs many bitcoin \"nodes\"  and then is able to correlate incoming (decrypted) traffic to originating IP address.  Of the two threat models I think this latter one is a greater concern.\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps if there were padding traffic and a tiny amount of broadcast of third-party txn as if they were private broadcast then the weakness under the traffic analysis case would be improved to be no worse than you'd have from just running ordinary P2P across tor?\r\n",

      "body": "> @1440000bytes, thanks for asking! There is some discussion at #27509 (the previous attempt on this).\r\n> \r\n> > Is it necessary to open new short lived tor/i2p connections for broadcasting the transaction?\r\n> \r\n> Yes, it is. See below.\r\n> \r\n> > What are the trade-offs in this implementation vs a simple implementation to relay tx to one or more peers that our node is already connected to?\r\n> \r\n> Sending the transaction over clearnet reveals the IP address/geolocation of the sender. A spy with many connections to the network could try to guess who was the originator. So, why not send it to our Tor peers only? Because it is relatively easy for a spy to fingerprint and link clearnet and Tor connections to the same peer. That is, a long running connection over Tor could be linked to a long running clearnet connection. This is why the proposed changes open a short-lived connection that does not reveal any of the identity of the sender.\r\n> \r\n> Would this benefit nodes that don't have clearnet connections, e.g. Tor/I2P-only nodes? Yes! In the case where the sender sends two otherwise unrelated transactions over the same long-running Tor connection, the recipient will know that they have the same origin, even though they are not related on-chain. Using single shot connections fixes that too.\r\n> \r\n> > Related issues:\r\n> \r\n> Linked in the OP, thanks!\r\n\r\nI am still not satisfied with this answer as a general approach could have allowed dandelion++ without changing bitcoin core. However, it improves privacy compared to status quo so I wont be a roadblock.\r\n\r\n ",

Other options I mentioned in that comment:\r\n\r\n> We do have a choice where about where to put public types which are not really part of any library. We can put them in the interfaces directory, or in common, or in the node and wallet directories. Personally, I think it makes sense to put them in the wallet directory when they are related to wallet functionality and used by wallet code, put them in the node directory when they are related to node functionality and used by node code, put them in the common directory when they are related to common functionality (like PSBT) and used by common code. The comments at the top of {node,wallet,common}/types.h files are meant to explain the idea that these are public types.",

This specific optimization does introduce a censorship risk (even if BIP 324 is used [edit: *due*] to the MITM consideration) and there precedent for such malicious exit nodes.\r\n\r\nFrom a privacy standpoint both optimizations would be more or less equivalent to broadcasting through isolated connections to peers with hidden service addresses, since the origin is still protected and being able to link these connections does not aid in deanonymization since these connections all pertain to the same data.\r\n\r\nThe main rationale for these optimizations is that Tor daemon builds circuits sequentially, and does not keep many built circuits in reserve (IIRC 2 unless their construction is explicitly requested through the control socket), so when SOCKS connections are opened with distinct credentials the connection establishment and time to first byte will typically scale linearly in the order that the SOCKS connections are accepted by tor daemon itself, and since building a new circuit can take on the order of seconds.",

I could complicate the fuzz tests to avoid sending unwanted messages if the random node happens to be a private broadcast, but `CConnman::PushMessage()` is called from a lot of places including from the RPC and that may change in the future as well. It is somewhat hard to judge that nobody will call `PushMessage()` with an unwanted message. Thus I think it is better to assume that this is the real check here in `CConnman::PushMessage()` and that the one in `PeerManagerImpl::SendMessages()` is an optimization. Removed the `Assume(false)`.",

We choose not to use our permanent `m_i2p_sam_session` to avoid linking this to our permanent I2P ID, however, we use a pool of transient I2P sessions (`m_unused_i2p_sessions`) instead. I understand these transient sessions can be reused (or at least that's what I get from the docs of `m_unused_i2p_sessions`). So if the same `(peer, session_id)` pair is picked, the node will know that we created both transactions, wouldn't it?",

They come to this code right away.\r\n\r\n* Even if there is a high demand for private broadcast connections, we would try to open such ones only half of the time in `CConnman::ThreadOpenConnections()` to avoid such starvation of only opening private broadcast and not others for a long time (see how `MaybePickPrivateBroadcastNetwork()` yields to other connection types if we previously opened a private broadcast one).\r\n\r\n* Non-`BLOCK_RELAY` connections keep us up to date as well (with new blocks). I.e blocks could come via inbound, full-outbound, etc.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, I think the current code does not need to be changed.",

It feels harder to reason about, but I don't see what the benefit of it is.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that it is simpler to implement that way (I think, somebody has a simpler proposal?). This is because the connman thread is creating the connections, they are consumed/used by the peerman thread and the requests for new connections can come from yet another (3rd) thread. For example, while connman is creating a new connection which is needed to broadcast a given transaction, that transaction may be successfully broadcast by peerman and received back from the network, rendering the just created new connection by connman unnecessary. This is harmless and I accept it because avoiding it would make things too complicated or slow.\r\n",

Calling this `NumToOpenSub()` is only done if `Remove()` succeeds and `NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX > num_broadcasted.value()` holds.

Would be nice to add one more test with a valid but different witness.\r\n\r\n>     4. sending a tx with in-mempool dependencies (both that succeed and fail due to existing/missing parent)\r\n\r\nDone, both.\r\n\r\n>     5. rpc failing if it detects `!g_reachable_nets`\r\n\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n>     6. what happens if there's not enough private connections when first broadcast attempt is tried, but more found later\r\n\r\nPrivate broadcast connections are created on demand. When first broadcast attempt is tried they are 0 (I did not add new test).\r\n\r\n>     7. what happens to pending broadcasts on restart of node\r\n\r\nThey are lost. Persistence over restart is not in this PR, but will be in a subsequent one (I did not add new test).",

Since tried table is smaller and sparsely filled especially for newer nodes, and addrs are picked with 50% probability from new/tried, this usually means that we are more likely to connect to them in the future - maybe via clearnet, maybe via future private connections.\r\n2.) On disconnection, we call `Connected()`, changing the `nTime` of an address (that could be included in getaddr answers).\r\n\r\nNot super easy to use either of these methods as an attack, but I still think it would be better not to do change addrman based on what happens in private connections.\r\n\r\nEven if we disabled that, an existing addrman that has only a few Tor peers in `tried` could make it likely that subsequent private txns would be made to the same node (which could help that peer connect these two transactions). That is a separate problem I don't see a straightforward solution for, but it would be mitigated by 1.) gathering more tried peers over time 2.) having many peers in the network make use of private broadcast.",

      "body": "This code in `CConnman::ThreadOpenConnections()` is not checking whether private broadcast is enabled because it is just a servant, its logic is: \"if there is a request to open private broadcast connections, then I will open them\". The higher level code is making the decision (currently in RPC only, but eventually in the wallet as well) - \"if private broadcast is enabled, then open such connections because I am now broadcasting a transaction (and don't put it in the mempool)\". This is why there is no check in `net.cpp` whether `-privatebroadcast` is enabled.\r\n\r\nI also find this snippet non-trivial to understand:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nCSemaphoreGrant grant{*semOutbound, /*fTry=*/true};\r\nif (open_private_broadcast_to.has_value() && grant) {\r\n    // Previous connection was private broadcast, thus yield to other connection types\r\n    // if we are ready to do so (the outbound semaphore gave green light).\r\n    open_private_broadcast_to.reset();\r\n} else if (!(open_private_broadcast_to = m_private_broadcast.ShouldOpen(num_private_broadcast_opened))) {\r\n    // No need for private broadcast connections, go with other ones. Acquire the\r\n    // grant if not already acquired. \r\n    grant.Acquire();\r\n}\r\n// else private broadcast is needed to network *open_private_broadcast_to, try to open one.\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me summarize why the logic is like that:\r\n* since private broadcast connections are needed now and are short lived, they override all others\r\n* however if there is a lot of demand for private broadcast connections we want to avoid starving other connection types, so we don't open two consecutive private broadcast connections and instead yield to others\r\n* but this yield to others may end up blocking on the grant for a long time because we are not ready to open other connection types whereas private broadcast connections are needed now.\r\n\r\nI am open to suggestions on how to implement that in a simpler way or how to simplify the logic itself (without sacrificing the functionality).",

I think this would happen in practice if they are one of the later broadcast attempts and already received the tx from someone else (as a result of our first attempts). I think that we would currently never disconnect on our end, but they might disconnect us after `TIMEOUT_INTERVAL=20min` because we don't answer their ping. But if they don't have this logic the connection might stay open indefinitely, whicih seems unfortunate, so we'd probably need some kind of timer here (see also other related comment)?\r\n",

So, in that setup the node is not listening (not accepting inbound connections), has only one connection to a known honest node and broadcasts its own transactions using private broadcast? That seems like an useful setup that would be nice to have support for. But the current semantic of `-connect` is \"only connect to the specified node(s)\" which is at odds with \"connect to random nodes for transaction broadcast\". I don't like changing the semantic of `-connect` like that.\r\n\r\nI wonder if this can be supported and to keep the current meaning of `-connect`... don't use `-connect` but somehow restrict our node to be able to only connect to 1 address :thinking: ",
