    "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* Independent improvement (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29419):\r\n  * `log: deduplicate category names and improve logging.cpp`\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

          "body": "To improve privacy, relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\n* Relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers.\r\n\r\n* Hide those transactions from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` requests, as if we don't have them.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, request the transaction with `GETDATA`, as if we didn't have it before.\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the unbroadcast list.\r\n\r\n* `INV` it to others as a result of the `TX` message we get, like what we do with transactions that are not ours.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new local transaction is received (from the wallet or RPC), the node will send it to 5 (`SENSITIVE_RELAY_NUM_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 5 more peers (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived sensitive relay connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers will blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable.\r\n* [x] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P.\r\n* [x] Do something with the user-agent string (could reveal identity if it has been personalized) and make sure no identifying information in the `VERSION` message. Done: took the [suggestion below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418).\r\n* [x] Improve the condition when we consider the transaction seen by the network: right now a single INV from somebody suffices (this is still an improvement over `master` which is ok right after pushing the tx to a peer). We could wait for more than one INV, from peers that we have selected (outbound) and that are specifically not the ones we broadcasted to (via short-lived connection). Edit: One `INV` should be enough because after that we broadcast the transaction to everybody we are connected to (like if it is not ours).\r\n* [ ] Idea: start with one connection per transaction (not 5 as it is now), optimistically assuming it will be sufficient. (numbers are examples) After 1 minute, if still not received from the network, try 2 connections, after a few minutes try more. If still unsuccessful after 10 minutes, then fall back to the old mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",

          "body": "#24748 added v2 transport to the python `P2PConnection`, but so far each test that wants to make use of it needs to enable it on an individual basis.\r\nThis PR changes it so that if the test suite is run with `--v2transport` option, v2 is used in each test by default, not only for connections between two bitcoind instances as before, but also wherever `P2PConnection` is used. Individual tests can override this global option.\r\n\r\nTo do that, a few tests need to be adjusted.\r\nIn addition, I added a commit to always use v1 in a few select subtests that send a large number of large messages (e.g. large reorgs). These tests don't have a fundamental problem with v2 but become very slow due to the unoptimised python ChaCha20 implementation (~30 minutes on my computer, so probably not suitable to be run in the CI).\r\n\r\nAs a result, `python3 test_runner.py --v2transport` should succeed and use `v2` everywhere (unless v1 is chosen explicitly).\r\n\r\n[Edit]: To make the \"test each commit\" CI pass, several test fixes were squashed into the last commit, which actually enables v2 p2p for `P2PConnection`. I have an unsquashed version at https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/202401_bip324_alltests_unsquashed, in case that helps with review.\r\n\r\n",

The main differences are explained here, including why Stratum v2 can't use BIP234 (yet): https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stratum-v2-noise-protocol-bip324-nuggets/413\r\n\r\nThe implementation is based on revision 38, 2018-07-11 (most recent at the time of writing).\r\n\r\nThe Stratum v2 spec defines the specific choice of ciphers: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/04-Protocol-Security.md\r\n\r\nThis protocol has been implemented in the Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI, using [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin)). https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum\r\n\r\nIt has also been (independently) implemented in BraiinsOS. This part is currently not open source, and it's behind on some recent changes.\r\n\r\nThe classes in `sv2_noise.h` attempt to stay close to the paper, whereas the test and fuzzer code borrow heavily from BIP324.\r\n\r\nIt's ready for review, but not for merge:\r\n\r\n1. The parent PR may need more conceptual review (and perhaps the entire spec, but that would really slow things down)\r\n2. We could decide to not support Noise encryption at all and require users to install separate software for that. Code review of this PR could help inform that decision.\r\n\r\nYou can see this code in action in the parent PR #29432.\r\n\r\nInitial seed corpus: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/169\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe following spec change is already implemented in this PR and in SRI:\r\n\r\n* The spec is being modified to use EllSwift (instead of regular x-only) for the encoding of public keys and ECDH: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66",

          "body": "This PR adds a new flag `-cleanupaddrman`. When initializing a node with this flag, it will delete addresses from addrman (both new and tried tables) that do not belong to the supported networks (e.g. `-onlynet`). Deleting addresses that do not belong to the supported networks can avoid a lot of unnecessary addrman `Select` calls (especially when turning from clearnet + Tor/I2P/CJDNS to Tor/I2P/CJDNS).\r\n\r\n1. This flag is not enabled by default, if user intends to go back to the previous network, just do not set it.\r\n2. Addresses from non-supported networks will naturely be replaced in addrman since we only store addresses from networks we support (cleaning up them on init is a way to avoid spending resources on it).\r\n3. Avoiding these addresses in addrman can avoid exceeding the maximum number of tries in `ThreadOpenConnections`.\r\n```cpp\r\n// If we didn't find an appropriate destination after trying 100 addresses fetched from addrman,\r\n// stop this loop, and let the outer loop run again (which sleeps, adds seed nodes, recalculates\r\n// already-connected network ranges, ...) before trying new addrman addresses.\r\nnTries++;\r\nif (nTries > 100)\r\n    break;\r\n```  \r\n4. Specially turning from clearnet + Tor/I2P/CJDNS to Tor/I2P/CJDNS, this feature it will ensure we will relay more addresses from these networks to other peers.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "Improve new LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(),  LogWarning(), LogError() macros introduced in #28318:\r\n\r\n- Make them all accept log categories, to make it possible to filter or highlight log messages from a particular component.\r\n- Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages.\r\n- Make them not rely on a global LogInstance, to provide better control of logging in controlled environments, such as unit tests that want to selectively capture log output, or libbitcoinkernel applications that want to have multiple instances of validation objects without mixing their log output.\r\n- Make them consistent, now accepting the same parameters.\r\n- Make them less verbose by not requiring BCLog category constants to be specified in individual log prints.\r\n\r\nAn [overview](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/99feed7350b5fc3ae3157dd395ae6260c5bfc092/src/logging.h#L285-L322) of the macros can be found in the logging header.\r\n\r\n### Problems this PR attempts to solve\r\n\r\nThe new log macros in introduced #28318 are generally great. They allow writing code that is succinct and clear, and they remove verbosity and a lot of ambiguity about log levels and categories. Unfortunately, the new macros are *slightly* less general than than needed to be used throughout the codebase. Particularly (1) These macros cannot be used directly in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages. (2) These macros cannot be used at all in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance. If this PR is rejected, the only alternative approach to solving these problems would be to reimplement these macros outside of the logging framework so they can be used by wallet and validation code. So this PR takes the simple approach of making a small external change to these macros while they are still brand new, so the benefits they bring can be used everywhere.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\n\r\n I would encourage first looking at the PR description and actual code changes in this PR to see what it is about (especially looking at changes to the actual log calls in the codebase). It should be possible to come to an independent judgement of this PR, before (or without necessarily) getting into the  discussion history of this PR. Unfortunately and regrettably, I made some dismissive comments on the previous PR, so the discussion here starts out immediately heated. I believe the criticism of this PR is well intended and made in good faith, but it brings up a lot of tangential issues, goes down some paths that are less constructive, and mostly is not focused on the problems this PR is trying to solve, or pointing out any potential harms that would be caused by merging this PR. I would very much welcome and encourage independent review while the other discussion is ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Relaying 1-parent-1-child CPFP when mempool min feerate is high would be a subset of the use cases, but a pretty significant improvement over what we have today.\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n- The majority of this code is useful for building e.g. #27742.\r\n\r\nThis means 1p1c packages propagate in the \"happy case\" where nobody is deliberately withholding packages.\r\n\r\nTo make this more robust, we need receiver-side logic to retry orphan resolution with multiple peers. Also, since we rely on the orphanage to remember the child while waiting for the parent, peers may cause us to drop packages by sending lots of orphans. To make this robust, we need to make efforts to protect some amount of orphans from eviction.\r\n\r\n[1]: see this writeup and its links https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/02ec218c7857ef60914e9a3d383b68caf987f70b/bip-0331.mediawiki#propagate-high-feerate-transactions",

This could be useful in the future for using or testing these classes without having to instantiate any form of signal handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).

          "body": "This is a follow-up of #28155 motivated by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28155#discussion_r1362677038\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nPrior to this, when establishing a network connection via CConnman::ConnectNode, if the connection needed address resolution, a single address would be picked at random from the resolved addresses and our node would try to connect to it. However, this would lead to the behavior of ConnectNode being unpredictable when the address was resolved to various ips (e.g. the address resolving to IPv4 and IPv6, but we only support one of them).\r\n\r\nThis patches the aforementioned behavior by going over all resolved IPs until a valid one is found or until we\r\nexhaust them.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

          "body": "This is joint work with amitiuttarwar.\r\n\r\nSee issue #28462 for a broader discussion on increasing the number of block-relay-only connections independent of this particular implementation proposal.\r\n\r\nWe suggest to increase the number of inbound slots allocated to block-relay-only peers by increasing the default maximum connections from 125 to 200, with 50% of inbound slots accessible for tx-relaying peers.\r\nThis is a prerequisite for being able to increase the default number of outgoing block-relay-only peers later, because the current inbound capacity of the network is not sufficient.\r\nIn order to account for incoming tx-relaying peers separately from incoming block-relay peers, changes to the inbound eviction logic are necessary.\r\n\r\nSee the next post in this thread for a more detailed explanation and motivation of the changes.",

I strongly suggest that reviewers look at that PR first to decide if they are comfortable with the overall approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly refactors, with a few behavior changes and improvements:\r\n- Introduces `TxDownloadManager`, which handles all transaction downloading. It contains the `TxRequestTracker`, `TxOrphanage`, and filters for `AlreadyHaveTx`.\r\n- Updates logs for tx {validation, relay, orphans} to include both txid and wtxid when possible.\r\n- Adds a new log category, `TXPACKAGES`. Logging in the orphanage is changed from `MEMPOOL` to `TXPACKAGES`.\r\n- Adds support for tracking when multiple peers provided the same tx in the orphanage.\r\n- Makes `TxDownloadManager` responsible for tracking the orphans we need to resolve and deciding how/when to resolve them.\r\n- Adds all announcers of an orphan as potential resolution candidates. This tracker is a `TxDownloadManager` which helps us schedule requests.\r\n   - In this PR, \"orphan resolution\" means requesting missing parents by `getdata(MSG_TX | MSG_WITNESS_FLAG, missing_txid)`.\r\n    - In a future PR, we'll add another resolution method, requesting ancestor wtxids using `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO, orphan_wtxid)`.",

This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

          "body": "Fixes #27744\r\n\r\nSince #27278 we log received headers. For compact blocks we also log which peer sent it (e5ce8576349d404c466b2f4cab1ca7bf920904b2), but not for regular headers. That required an additional refactor, which this PR provides.\r\n\r\nMove the logging from validation to net_processing.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the number of log entries (under default configuration) per compact block header from 3 to 2: one for the header and one for the connected tip.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces a new helper method `LogBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a _compact block_ we call `LogBlockHeader` from the exact same place as where we previously logged. So that log message doesn't change. What does change is that we no longer _also_ log from `AcceptBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a regular header(s) message, _we only log the last one_. This is a change in behaviour because it was simpler to implement, but it's probably better anyway. It does mean that if a peer sends of a bunch of headers of which _any_ is invalid, we won't log it (here).\r\n\r\nLastly I expanded the code comment explaining why we log this. It initially only covered selfish mining, but we also care about peers sending us headers but not following up (see e.g. #27626).\r\n\r\nExample log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:21Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:23Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223098 tx=848176824 date='2023-06-05T13:11:49Z' progress=1.000000 cache=6.4MiB(54615txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223112 tx=848179461 date='2023-06-05T13:13:58Z' progress=1.000000 cache=7.2MiB(61275txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:41Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 peer=8\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:42Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 version=0x2db3c000 log2_work=94.223126 tx=848182944 date='2023-06-05T13:14:35Z' progress=1.000000 cache=8.0MiB(69837txo)\r\n```",

A possibility could be through a net permission flag, if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27114 makes it in.\"\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17167#issuecomment-1168606032 - \"This would allow us to use https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25355 when making outgoing connections to all nodes, except to whitelisted ones for which we would use our persistent I2P address.\"\r\n- Force-relay/mempool permissions for a node you intentionally connected to.\r\n",

          "body": "This adds five new tracepoints with documentation and tests for network connections:\r\n\r\n- established connections with `net:inbound_connection` and `net:outbound_connection`\r\n- closed connections (both closed by us or by the peer) with `net:closed_connnection`\r\n- inbound connections that we choose to evict with `net:evicted_inbound_connection`\r\n- connections that are misbehaving and punished with `net:misbehaving_connection`\r\n\r\nI've been using these tracepoints for a few months now to monitor connection lifetimes, re-connection frequency by IP and netgroup, misbehavior, peer discouragement, and eviction and more. Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, score_before=0, score_increase=20, message='getdata message size = 50001', threshold_exceeded=false\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",

      "body": "@1440000bytes, thanks for asking! There is some discussion at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509 (the previous attempt on this).\r\n\r\n> Is it necessary to open new short lived tor/i2p connections for broadcasting the transaction?\r\n\r\nYes, it is. See below.\r\n\r\n> What are the trade-offs in this implementation vs a simple implementation to relay tx to one or more peers that our node is already connected to?\r\n\r\nSending the transaction over clearnet reveals the IP address/geolocation of the sender. A spy with many connections to the network could try to guess who was the originator. So, why not send it to our Tor peers only? Because it is relatively easy for a spy to fingerprint and link clearnet and Tor connections to the same peer. That is, a long running connection over Tor could be linked to a long running clearnet connection. This is why the proposed changes open a short-lived connection that does not reveal any of the identity of the sender.\r\n\r\nWould this benefit nodes that don't have clearnet connections, e.g. Tor/I2P-only nodes? Yes! In the case where the sender sends two otherwise unrelated transactions over the same long-running Tor connection, the recipient will know that they have the same origin, even though they are not related on-chain. Using single shot connections fixes that too.\r\n\r\n> Related issues:\r\n\r\nLinked in the OP, thanks!",

So using a specific trusted peer to rebroadcast seems reasonable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, user might have a Transport v2 connection and it's biggest worry is his ISP spying on him. In this case the user might want to use (one of) his v2 connected peers for (re)broadcasting the tx.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nnew RPC `sendrawtransactiontopeer`, where the raw tx and peer are specified\r\n(somewhat similar to `sendmsgtopeer`)\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n- [have an argument in `sendrawtransaction` to specify a peer](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876#issue-879140859)\r\n- [ _use -connect=<ip> to connect only to the specified node(s)._](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876#issuecomment-1212166950) (for this, the user would need to restart and disconnect all other peers every time he wants to do it)\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876, similar request but suggesting to add an argument in `sendrawtransaction` to mention the peer\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509, useful but `sendrawtransactiontopeer` would still be a good addition imo\r\n\r\n**Could this be used by malicious parties (who want to get a better view of the network etc)?** \r\nMaybe, but they might already be doing that with a modified client.\r\n\r\nIn contrary, `sendrawtransactiontopeer` might make transaction broadcast/relay analysis harder.",

          "title": "Stratum v2 Template Provider (take 3)",
          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",
