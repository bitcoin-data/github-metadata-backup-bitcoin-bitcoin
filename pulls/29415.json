    "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* Independent improvement (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29419):\r\n  * `log: deduplicate category names and improve logging.cpp`\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

          "body": "To improve privacy, relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\n* Relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers.\r\n\r\n* Hide those transactions from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` requests, as if we don't have them.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, request the transaction with `GETDATA`, as if we didn't have it before.\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the unbroadcast list.\r\n\r\n* `INV` it to others as a result of the `TX` message we get, like what we do with transactions that are not ours.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new local transaction is received (from the wallet or RPC), the node will send it to 5 (`SENSITIVE_RELAY_NUM_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 5 more peers (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived sensitive relay connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers will blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable.\r\n* [x] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P.\r\n* [x] Do something with the user-agent string (could reveal identity if it has been personalized) and make sure no identifying information in the `VERSION` message. Done: took the [suggestion below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418).\r\n* [x] Improve the condition when we consider the transaction seen by the network: right now a single INV from somebody suffices (this is still an improvement over `master` which is ok right after pushing the tx to a peer). We could wait for more than one INV, from peers that we have selected (outbound) and that are specifically not the ones we broadcasted to (via short-lived connection). Edit: One `INV` should be enough because after that we broadcast the transaction to everybody we are connected to (like if it is not ours).\r\n* [ ] Idea: start with one connection per transaction (not 5 as it is now), optimistically assuming it will be sufficient. (numbers are examples) After 1 minute, if still not received from the network, try 2 connections, after a few minutes try more. If still unsuccessful after 10 minutes, then fall back to the old mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",

          "body": "#24748 added v2 transport to the python `P2PConnection`, but so far each test that wants to make use of it needs to enable it on an individual basis.\r\nThis PR changes it so that if the test suite is run with `--v2transport` option, v2 is used in each test by default, not only for connections between two bitcoind instances as before, but also wherever `P2PConnection` is used. Individual tests can override this global option.\r\n\r\nTo do that, a few tests need to be adjusted.\r\nIn addition, I added a commit to always use v1 in a few select subtests that send a large number of large messages (e.g. large reorgs). These tests don't have a fundamental problem with v2 but become very slow due to the unoptimised python ChaCha20 implementation (~30 minutes on my computer, so probably not suitable to be run in the CI).\r\n\r\nAs a result, `python3 test_runner.py --v2transport` should succeed and use `v2` everywhere (unless v1 is chosen explicitly).\r\n\r\n[Edit]: To make the \"test each commit\" CI pass, several test fixes were squashed into the last commit, which actually enables v2 p2p for `P2PConnection`. I have an unsquashed version at https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/202401_bip324_alltests_unsquashed, in case that helps with review.\r\n\r\n",

The main differences are explained here, including why Stratum v2 can't use BIP234 (yet): https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stratum-v2-noise-protocol-bip324-nuggets/413\r\n\r\nThe implementation is based on revision 38, 2018-07-11 (most recent at the time of writing).\r\n\r\nThe Stratum v2 spec defines the specific choice of ciphers: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/04-Protocol-Security.md\r\n\r\nThis protocol has been implemented in the Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI, using [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin)). https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum\r\n\r\nIt has also been (independently) implemented in BraiinsOS. This part is currently not open source, and it's behind on some recent changes.\r\n\r\nThe classes in `sv2_noise.h` attempt to stay close to the paper, whereas the test and fuzzer code borrow heavily from BIP324.\r\n\r\nIt's ready for review, but not for merge:\r\n\r\n1. The parent PR may need more conceptual review (and perhaps the entire spec, but that would really slow things down)\r\n2. We could decide to not support Noise encryption at all and require users to install separate software for that. Code review of this PR could help inform that decision.\r\n\r\nYou can see this code in action in the parent PR #29432.\r\n\r\nInitial seed corpus: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/169\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe following spec change is already implemented in this PR and in SRI:\r\n\r\n* The spec is being modified to use EllSwift (instead of regular x-only) for the encoding of public keys and ECDH: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66",

          "body": "This PR adds a new flag `-cleanupaddrman`. When initializing a node with this flag, it will delete addresses from addrman (both new and tried tables) that do not belong to the supported networks (e.g. `-onlynet`). Deleting addresses that do not belong to the supported networks can avoid a lot of unnecessary addrman `Select` calls (especially when turning from clearnet + Tor/I2P/CJDNS to Tor/I2P/CJDNS).\r\n\r\n1. This flag is not enabled by default, if user intends to go back to the previous network, just do not set it.\r\n2. Addresses from non-supported networks will naturely be replaced in addrman since we only store addresses from networks we support (cleaning up them on init is a way to avoid spending resources on it).\r\n3. Avoiding these addresses in addrman can avoid exceeding the maximum number of tries in `ThreadOpenConnections`.\r\n```cpp\r\n// If we didn't find an appropriate destination after trying 100 addresses fetched from addrman,\r\n// stop this loop, and let the outer loop run again (which sleeps, adds seed nodes, recalculates\r\n// already-connected network ranges, ...) before trying new addrman addresses.\r\nnTries++;\r\nif (nTries > 100)\r\n    break;\r\n```  \r\n4. Specially turning from clearnet + Tor/I2P/CJDNS to Tor/I2P/CJDNS, this feature it will ensure we will relay more addresses from these networks to other peers.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "Improve new LogDebug(), LogTrace(), LogInfo(),  LogWarning(), LogError() macros introduced in #28318:\r\n\r\n- Make them consistent, now all accepting the same parameters.\r\n- Make them all accept log categories, to make it possible to filter or highlight log messages from a particular component.\r\n- Make them compatible with wallet logging, which includes the wallet name in log messages.\r\n- Make them not rely on a global LogInstance, to provide better control of logging in controlled environments, such as unit tests that want to selectively capture log output, or libbitcoinkernel applications that want to have multiple instances of validation objects without mixing their log output.\r\n- Make them less verbose by not requiring category constants to be specified in individual log prints.\r\n\r\nAn [overview](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0cd1616d47e61e125eb3e573573c0c56fba6b775/src/logging.h#L293-L332) of the macros can be found in the logging header.\r\n\r\n### Problems this PR attempts to solve\r\n\r\nThe new log macros in introduced #28318 are generally great. They allow writing code that is succinct and clear, and make it a lot easier to figure out what log levels are being used. Unfortunately, the new macros are slightly less general than than needed to be used throughout the codebase. Particularly:\r\n\r\n1. The new macros cannot be used conveniently in wallet code because wallet log prints are supposed to automatically attach wallet names to log messages.\r\n2. The new macros cannot be used in libbitcoinkernel code because they do not allow specifying a logger instance.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, the only alternative approach to solving these problems would be to reimplement these macros outside the logging framework so they could be used by wallet and validation code. This PR just takes the approach of slightly generalizing these macros so they work everywhere.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\n\r\nI'd encourage looking at the description and code changes in this PR to evaluate it and try to come an independent judgement before looking at the discussion history. Unfortunately and regrettably, I made some dismissive comments on the previous PR, so the discussion here starts out immediately heated. I think the criticisms in the discussion are well intended and made in good faith, but they go down a lot of tangents, and as far as I can tell are only making the argument that this PR is unnecessary, not that it is harmful, so I don't think they are essential to read or understand.",

          "body": "The first couple commits are in #29619, please review that first.\r\n\r\nEnable 1-parent-1-child package relay :rocket: (just using the existing protocol messages).\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- Package relay is nice [1]. Relaying 1-parent-1-child CPFP when mempool min feerate is high would be a subset of the use cases, but a pretty significant improvement over what we have today.\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n- The majority of this code is useful for building e.g. #27742.\r\n\r\nThis means 1p1c packages propagate in the \"happy case\" where nobody is deliberately withholding packages.\r\n\r\nTo make this more robust, we need receiver-side logic to retry orphan resolution with multiple peers. Also, since we rely on the orphanage to remember the child while waiting for the parent, peers may cause us to drop packages by sending lots of orphans. To make this robust, we need to make efforts to protect some amount of orphans from eviction.\r\n\r\n[1]: see this writeup and its links https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/02ec218c7857ef60914e9a3d383b68caf987f70b/bip-0331.mediawiki#propagate-high-feerate-transactions",

This could be useful in the future for using or testing these classes without having to instantiate any form of signal handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).

          "body": "This is a follow-up of #28155 motivated by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28155#discussion_r1362677038\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nPrior to this, when establishing a network connection via CConnman::ConnectNode, if the connection needed address resolution, a single address would be picked at random from the resolved addresses and our node would try to connect to it. However, this would lead to the behavior of ConnectNode being unpredictable when the address was resolved to various ips (e.g. the address resolving to IPv4 and IPv6, but we only support one of them).\r\n\r\nThis patches the aforementioned behavior by going over all resolved IPs until a valid one is found or until we\r\nexhaust them.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

          "body": "This is joint work with amitiuttarwar.\r\n\r\nSee issue #28462 for a broader discussion on increasing the number of block-relay-only connections independent of this particular implementation proposal.\r\n\r\nWe suggest to increase the number of inbound slots allocated to block-relay-only peers by increasing the default maximum connections from 125 to 200, with 50% of inbound slots accessible for tx-relaying peers.\r\nThis is a prerequisite for being able to increase the default number of outgoing block-relay-only peers later, because the current inbound capacity of the network is not sufficient.\r\nIn order to account for incoming tx-relaying peers separately from incoming block-relay peers, changes to the inbound eviction logic are necessary.\r\n\r\nSee the next post in this thread for a more detailed explanation and motivation of the changes.",

I strongly suggest that reviewers look at that PR first to decide if they are comfortable with the overall approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly refactors, with a few behavior changes and improvements:\r\n- Introduces `TxDownloadManager`, which handles all transaction downloading. It contains the `TxRequestTracker`, `TxOrphanage`, and filters for `AlreadyHaveTx`.\r\n- Updates logs for tx {validation, relay, orphans} to include both txid and wtxid when possible.\r\n- Adds a new log category, `TXPACKAGES`. Logging in the orphanage is changed from `MEMPOOL` to `TXPACKAGES`.\r\n- Adds support for tracking when multiple peers provided the same tx in the orphanage.\r\n- Makes `TxDownloadManager` responsible for tracking the orphans we need to resolve and deciding how/when to resolve them.\r\n- Adds all announcers of an orphan as potential resolution candidates. This tracker is a `TxDownloadManager` which helps us schedule requests.\r\n   - In this PR, \"orphan resolution\" means requesting missing parents by `getdata(MSG_TX | MSG_WITNESS_FLAG, missing_txid)`.\r\n    - In a future PR, we'll add another resolution method, requesting ancestor wtxids using `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO, orphan_wtxid)`.",

This TXO set is iterated for balance checking and coin selection preparation, which can still be slow for wallets that have had a lot of activity. This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

          "body": "Fixes #27744\r\n\r\nSince #27278 we log received headers. For compact blocks we also log which peer sent it (e5ce8576349d404c466b2f4cab1ca7bf920904b2), but not for regular headers. That required an additional refactor, which this PR provides.\r\n\r\nMove the logging from validation to net_processing.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the number of log entries (under default configuration) per compact block header from 3 to 2: one for the header and one for the connected tip.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces a new helper method `LogBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a _compact block_ we call `LogBlockHeader` from the exact same place as where we previously logged. So that log message doesn't change. What does change is that we no longer _also_ log from `AcceptBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a regular header(s) message, _we only log the last one_. This is a change in behaviour because it was simpler to implement, but it's probably better anyway. It does mean that if a peer sends of a bunch of headers of which _any_ is invalid, we won't log it (here).\r\n\r\nLastly I expanded the code comment explaining why we log this. It initially only covered selfish mining, but we also care about peers sending us headers but not following up (see e.g. #27626).\r\n\r\nExample log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:21Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:23Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223098 tx=848176824 date='2023-06-05T13:11:49Z' progress=1.000000 cache=6.4MiB(54615txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223112 tx=848179461 date='2023-06-05T13:13:58Z' progress=1.000000 cache=7.2MiB(61275txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:41Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 peer=8\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:42Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 version=0x2db3c000 log2_work=94.223126 tx=848182944 date='2023-06-05T13:14:35Z' progress=1.000000 cache=8.0MiB(69837txo)\r\n```",

Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, score_before=0, score_increase=20, message='getdata message size = 50001', threshold_exceeded=false\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",

      "body": "@1440000bytes, thanks for asking! There is some discussion at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509 (the previous attempt on this).\r\n\r\n> Is it necessary to open new short lived tor/i2p connections for broadcasting the transaction?\r\n\r\nYes, it is. See below.\r\n\r\n> What are the trade-offs in this implementation vs a simple implementation to relay tx to one or more peers that our node is already connected to?\r\n\r\nSending the transaction over clearnet reveals the IP address/geolocation of the sender. A spy with many connections to the network could try to guess who was the originator. So, why not send it to our Tor peers only? Because it is relatively easy for a spy to fingerprint and link clearnet and Tor connections to the same peer. That is, a long running connection over Tor could be linked to a long running clearnet connection. This is why the proposed changes open a short-lived connection that does not reveal any of the identity of the sender.\r\n\r\nWould this benefit nodes that don't have clearnet connections, e.g. Tor/I2P-only nodes? Yes! In the case where the sender sends two otherwise unrelated transactions over the same long-running Tor connection, the recipient will know that they have the same origin, even though they are not related on-chain. Using single shot connections fixes that too.\r\n\r\n> Related issues:\r\n\r\nLinked in the OP, thanks!",

So using a specific trusted peer to rebroadcast seems reasonable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, user might have a Transport v2 connection and it's biggest worry is his ISP spying on him. In this case the user might want to use (one of) his v2 connected peers for (re)broadcasting the tx.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nnew RPC `sendrawtransactiontopeer`, where the raw tx and peer are specified\r\n(somewhat similar to `sendmsgtopeer`)\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n- [have an argument in `sendrawtransaction` to specify a peer](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876#issue-879140859)\r\n- [ _use -connect=<ip> to connect only to the specified node(s)._](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876#issuecomment-1212166950) (for this, the user would need to restart and disconnect all other peers every time he wants to do it)\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876, similar request but suggesting to add an argument in `sendrawtransaction` to mention the peer\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509, useful but `sendrawtransactiontopeer` would still be a good addition imo\r\n\r\n**Could this be used by malicious parties (who want to get a better view of the network etc)?** \r\nMaybe, but they might already be doing that with a modified client.\r\n\r\nIn contrary, `sendrawtransactiontopeer` might make transaction broadcast/relay analysis harder.",

          "body": "The code in `logging.cpp` needs to: \r\n* Get the category name given the flag (e.g. `BCLog::PRUNE` -> `\"prune\"`)\r\n* Get the flag given the category name (e.g. `\"prune\"` -> `BCLog::PRUNE`)\r\n* Get the list of category names sorted in alphabetical order\r\n\r\nAchieve this by using the proper std containers. The result is\r\n* less code (the diff of the first commit is +62 / -129)\r\n* faster code (to linear search and no copy+sort)\r\n* more maintainable code (the categories are no longer duplicated in `LogCategories[]` and `LogCategoryToStr()`)\r\n\r\nThis behavior is preserved:\r\n`BCLog::NONE` -> `\"\"` (lookup by `LogCategoryToStr()`)\r\n`\"\"` -> `BCLog::ALL` (lookup by `GetLogCategory(\"\")`)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso remove unused `BCLog::UTIL`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThese changes (modulo the `BCLog::UTIL` removal) are part of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415 but they make sense on their own and would be good to have them, regardless of the fate of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415.

          "title": "Stratum v2 Template Provider (take 3)",
          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

          "body": "This suggests a strategy to run the functional tests with both v1 and v2 transport in the CI.\r\n\r\n**Status Quo:**\r\nThere is both the global `--v2transport` option for the `test_runner.py` (not enabled by default), plus the possibility to specify `--v2transport` for particular tests, which is used for a handful of tests. Currently, when running `test_runner.py --v2transport`, these tests are run twice with the same `--v2transport` configuration, as has been noted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29358#discussion_r1485626063, which is wasteful.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Change:**\r\nFix this by adding a `--v1transport` option and using it in `test_runner.py`, so that irrespective of the global `--v2transport` flag, the  tests that run twice use v1 in one run and v2 in the other.\r\nAlso add `--v2transport` to one CI task (`multiprocess, i686, DEBUG`).\r\nThis means, that for each CI task, the majority of functional tests will run once using the global `--v2transport` option if provided, while a few selected tests will always run two times, once with `v1` and once with `v2`.\r\n\r\n**Rationale:**\r\nA simpler alternative would have been to remove all test-specific `--v2transport` commands from `test_runner.py` and just enable `--v2transport` option for a few CI tasks. I didn't do that because it would have meant that v2 would never be running in the CI for some platforms, and also be run a lot less locally by users and devs (who would have to actively enable the `--v2transport` option).

At the graph level, this will deploy a Tor DA container on the network. At the tank level, it will start the tor daemon in that particular tank. This keeps the resource-hungry Tor as optional as possible. Of course you will also need to configure bitcoind in the tanks to use Tor once it's up.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <graph edgedefault=\"directed\">\r\n    <data key=\"tor\">true</data>\r\n    <node id=\"0\">\r\n        <data key=\"image\">pinheadmz/bitcoin:26.0_with_tor</data>\r\n        <data key=\"bitcoin_config\">-uacomment=w0 -onion=localhost:9050</data>\r\n        <data key=\"tor\">true</data>\r\n    </node>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nStill using hard coded IP `100.20.15.18` (20-15-18 is \"t-o-r\" ;-) ) for the Tor DA, but I think with some clever entrypoint and environment variable stuff we can make this more flexible and eventually deploy in k8s as well.\r\n\r\nUses as a healthcheck the Tor daemon endpoint  `status/bootstrap-phase\"` (see https://spec.torproject.org/control-spec/commands.html) and similar to LN integration, I wrote a scenario `onion_init` which waits for DA health, and then creates a ring shaped network graph from all the tanks' onion addresses. Shaping this graph or using edges configured in the graphml file is a future TODO.\r\n",

          "title": "net_processing: make any misbehavior trigger immediate discouragement",
          "body": "So far, discouragement of peers triggers when their misbehavior score exceeds 100 points. Most types of misbehavior increment the score by 100, triggering immediate discouragement, but some types do not. This PR makes all increments equal to either 100 (meaning any misbehavior will immediately cause disconnection and discouragement) or 0 (making the behavior effectively unconditionally allowed), and then removes the logic for score accumulation.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies the code a bit, but also makes protocol expectations clearer: if a peer misbehaves, they get disconnected. There is no good reason why certain types of protocol violations should be permitted 4 times (howmuch=20) or 9 times (howmuch=10), while many others are never allowed. Furthermore, the distinction between these looks arbitrary.\r\n\r\nTo assess whether this does not unduly affect existing other software on the network, I've been running this with an additional patch (see https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/202403_nomisbehave_log) that adds logging whenever behavior is detected whose misbehavior increment is changed to 100 by this PR. Over the past day I have not seen any instances on my well-connected node (~150 incoming connections), but will continue to monitor.\r\n\r\nThe specific types of misbehavior that are changed to 100 are:\r\n* Sending us a `block` which does not connect to our header tree (which necessarily must have been unsollicited). [used to be score 10]\r\n* Sending us a `headers` with a non-continuous headers sequence. [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 1000 addresses in a single `addr` or `addrv2` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 50000 invs in a single `inv` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 2000 headers in a single `headers` message [used to be score 20]\r\n\r\nThe specific types of misbehavior that are changed to 0 are:\r\n* Sending us 10 (*) separate BIP130 headers announcements that do not connect to our block tree [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 8 headers in a single `headers` message (which thus does not get treated as a BIP130 announcement) that does not connect to our block tree. [used to be score 10]\r\n\r\nI believe that none of these behaviors are unavoidable, except for the one marked (*) which can in theory happen still due to interaction between BIP130 and variations in system clocks (the max 2 hour in the future rule). This one has been removed entirely.\r\n\r\nIn an unrelated improvement, this also gets rid of the 8 header limit heuristic to determine whether an incoming non-connecting `headers` is a potential BIP130 announcement, as this rule is no longer needed to prevent spurious Misbehavior. Instead, any non-connecting `headers` is now treated as a potential announcement.",

      "body": "concept ACK 6fad02cf03 \r\n\r\n(code review in progress)\r\n\r\nI am also testing this feature in Warnet, which deploys a regtest network and even has an internal Tor DA so I can simulate onion routing locally. Currently using a 20-node [graph](https://github.com/pinheadmz/warnet/blob/priv-broadcast/test/data/onion.graphml) and a [scenario](https://github.com/pinheadmz/warnet/blob/priv-broadcast/src/scenarios/onion_init.py) which connects the graph, adds onion addresses to the test node, and then sends a raw transaction from the node running this branch.\r\n\r\nThe private broadcast succeeds frequently but not always. In Warnet anyway I had better luck when the test node had `-listenonion=0`, I tried that after suspecting that inbound onion connections were removing potential peers from the private broadcast list, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nI think I noticed this in the original PR as well, if multiple transactions are sent, the count keeps going up without a limit: \r\n\r\n```\r\n [privatebroadcast] Requested to open 60 connection(s), trying to open one\r\n```\r\n\r\nScreenshot below, I managed to capture a private broadcast connection! I'll mention when i get to that commit in review as well, but the connection type `\"privbcast\"` is breaking the very nice `-netinfo` table :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far I have a few questions about the strategy:\r\n\r\n1. How do we pick the onion peers to relay to? If we avoid reusing peers then (especially in my miniature network) we can run out quickly, and nothing ever gets broadcast.\r\n\r\n2. Are we using fresh Tor identities for these connections? I think [Wasabi does something like this:](https://docs.wasabiwallet.app/why-wasabi/NetworkLevelPrivacy.html)\r\n\r\n> Wasabi connects to each peer through a different Tor stream. \r\n\r\n3. Do you think we need any RPC to get the status of private tx sends or provide the option to abandon (or revert to clearnet?)\r\n\r\n4. I assume you are restricting the feature to sendraw so the wallet doesn't get involved and try something silly like rebroadcasting over clearnet or inserting in to our own mempool? Do you think future work will integrate the wallet?\r\n\r\n\r\n![privbroadcast](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/2084648/ec172be1-e5d8-4c00-94fc-e219dccacdec)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@pinheadmz, excellent! Thank you for looking into this! Replies inline:\r\n\r\n> The private broadcast succeeds frequently but not always\r\n\r\nLets debug this in a sub-thread in order not to overwhelm the PR main thread: [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415/files#r1519402830).\r\n\r\n> suspecting that inbound onion connections were removing potential peers from the private broadcast list\r\n\r\nNo, this cannot be the case. Inbound onion connections appear as IPv4 connections coming from the Tor daemon. They do not have any source address associated with them, other than the one of the Tor daemon itself (usually `127.0.0.1`).\r\n\r\n> I think I noticed this in the original PR as well, if multiple transactions are sent, the count keeps going up without a limit\r\n\r\nThat is now capped at `size_t MAX_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_CONNECTIONS{64}`.\r\n\r\n> the connection type `\"privbcast\"` is breaking the very nice `-netinfo` table\r\n\r\nThis better be addressed in the visualization engine, e.g. by using `%5.5s`\r\n\r\n> How do we pick the onion peers to relay to? If we avoid reusing peers then...\r\n\r\nWe pick a random Tor (or I2P) peer. In the same way we choose the address when we want to have an outbound connection to a peer from a particular network. No attempt to avoid reuse. But we don't connect to already connected peers. This is the logic as in `master`.\r\n\r\n> Are we using fresh Tor identities for these connections?\r\n\r\nYes, if `-proxyrandomize=1` (the default). This is the same in `master` - separate Tor circuit per connection. This PR does the same as Wasabi: https://docs.wasabiwallet.app/why-wasabi/NetworkLevelPrivacy.html#wasabi-wallet-light-node\r\n\r\n> Do you think we need any RPC to get the status of private tx sends or provide the option to abandon (or revert to clearnet?)\r\n\r\nYes, both would be useful, but as a followup PR. I am afraid putting those here would bloat this PR too much. I could however implement that and publish it under Draft PR that depends on this one, so people can use it during testing.\r\n\r\n> I assume you are restricting the feature to sendraw so the wallet doesn't get involved and try something silly like rebroadcasting over clearnet or inserting in to our own mempool?\r\n\r\nThe reason to omit the wallet is that it currently does not count non-mempool change. For example, if we have 1 BTC and send 0.6 to somebody and 0.4 as change, the wallet will show a balance of 0 (or 1, unchanged? somebody correct me if I am wrong) until the transaction enters the mempool (or gets mined in a block). This would be quite rough user experience. Note that this is already the case in `master` if `-walletbroadcast=0`.\r\n\r\n> Do you think future work will integrate the wallet?\r\n\r\nYes, but I left that for another PR. Omitting it here reduces the size of this PR and allows to deal with the wallet in isolation, after all the distracting infrastructure is in (e.g. log category, new type of connection, the \"net\" code, etc).\r\n",
