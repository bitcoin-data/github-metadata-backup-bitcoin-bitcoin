The line numbers didn't change, so it's the same as before.\n\nI came to the same conclusion when I looked into it last time, but @mikehearn was confident that the issue couldn't be here. My guess was that it could be caused by a non-so-random PRNG causing ping lookups to race. In that case, replacing the bitcoind.ping().get() with bitcoind.ping(counter++).get() would avoid the issue I think.\n\n@mikehearn Mind having another look, now that we're sure the line#s are good? Even better, since @dexX7 can reproduce locally, maybe he'll be able to test proposed changes more easily.\n",
