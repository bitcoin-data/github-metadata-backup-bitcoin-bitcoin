To prevent that, filter out nodes that definitely shouldn't be sending/processing messages.\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up, I'd like to remove the assert, as I think it's done its job, but I'll save that discussion for another PR because I think @TheBlueMatt mentioned that he'd prefer to keep it.",

To prevent that, filter out nodes that definitely shouldn't be sending/processing messages.\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up, I'd like to remove the assert, as I think it's done its job, but I'll save that discussion for another PR because I think @TheBlueMatt mentioned that he'd prefer to keep it.",

          "body": "This is partial backport of Bitcoin PR bitcoin/bitcoin#9626.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this backport is to fix locking issues introduced by earlier backported PR.\r\n\r\nThis backport includes only 2 of 3 original commits. Last commit is omitted because it moves important code from `CConnman::ConnectNode()` method to `CConnman::OpenNetworkConnection()`. This code adds newly created `CNode` to `CConnman::vNodes` vector and emits `InitializeNode` signal. Moving this code is OK for Bitcoin because `CConnman::ConnectNode()` is private there and the only caller of this method is `CConnman::OpenNetworkConnection()`. Unfortunately, this is not the case in Dash: `CConnman::ConnectNode()` is called in some places of Dash-specific code, so moving important functionality out if this method will break that code.\r\n\r\nHence, the last commit is not included in this backport. It can be backported separately later after we decide how to refactor Dash-specific code that uses `CConnman::ConnectNode()`.\r\n\r\nThe original PR description follows.\r\n---\r\nThis should fix the long-standing (read: satoshi-era) bug where we may not delete a node if we try to connect to it (via RPC) after its already connected as we'll have duplicate refs.\r\n\r\nThis also removes some unused functions (some of which miss a lock, some of which should otherwise be cleaned up for bitcoin/bitcoin#9609).\r\n\r\nThis also ensures that if we return a CNode* from FindNode, we are still holding cs_vNodes if we use it for anything aside from existance-checking, fixing a stupid-unlikely race where it might be deleted out from under us.",
