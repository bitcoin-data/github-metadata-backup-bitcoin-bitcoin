    "body": "I'm not sure if this actually makes sense to include in the mainline code, but I'm PRing here in case others think it may be useful. It has proven to be extremely helpful for me in the last few days while testing various mining software.\n\nThis enables anyone to \"mine\" on any chain, including mainnet in realtime, in order to test mining software. The desired difficulty is set via a bitcoind param `-forceminerdifficulty=n`. The difficulty is set in bitcoind rather than via a new rpc command or getblocktemplate/submitblock in order to facilitate testing mining/pool software that may be hard to change (for example, in embedded hardware, or pool software running on a different machine).\n### Backstory\n\nI was recently working on adding segwit commitments to some existing mining software. After doing basic sanity checks, I let it run on testnet (where the difficulty is currently very high) for a few days. I began to notice a subtle race condition that caused a small percentage of blocks to be rejected, with no obvious cause for the breakage.\n\nI didn't think that my code could've caused the problem, and ordinarily I would just re-run on the unpatched code. Problem was, testnet3 has activated segwit, and the unpatched miner could not insert the commitment. So the only way to really simulate (without manually creating lots of peers and transactions in order to stumble upon the problem) would be to mine on mainnet. Obviously that wasn't realistic.\n### Solution\n\nMine on mainnet with a specified difficulty, ignore the work requirement, validate, report success, then throw the block away. This turned out to work beautifully. The time it took me to reproduce the error dropped from ~10hrs to ~30sec.\n\nIn this case, specifying the difficulty, rather than simply setting it to the minimum, was crucial. The race condition occurred only after rolling the extranonce a few times.\n\nI believe this approach should work universally. Mining/Pooling software gets a little cranky about stale blocks, but otherwise works fine.\n",

Most mining/pool software at the moment has only hard-coded support for paying to a pubkey hash. Obviously it would be nice give them the ability to support the other formats, but as-is, it can be tough (and potentially very expensive) to simulate mining for a few days on mainnet.\n\n(Though you could make the argument that a preference should be submitted to in gbt via coinbasetxn, which would include a serialized scriptPubKey or txout with the template, but let's ignore that for the sake of the example).\n\nThis would allow those changes to be made/tested safely, without having to worry about differences in chaings wrt activation status.\n\nAs for changing the consensus.powLimit, I was hoping to avoid mixing app logic in at the chain level.\n",

Whatever gets merged first will force the other one to rebase, but in a more or less trivial way. What you shouldn't do to avoid colliding with https://github.com/gmaxwell/bitcoin/commit/2db190b183c5204da23191ca642c7f6cad412ae3 is doing the same for CheckBlock and CheckBlockHeader. Those will have to take both a powLimit and the whole consensusParams (for @gmaxwell will need the struct in CheckBlockHeader()).\n",

I haven't looked closely though, that may not be the case. Either way, I'm sure rebasing would be no problem.\n\nAnd the goal isn't to relay an invalid block, it is simply to validate an otherwise-valid block that doesn't provide enough work. If that's the case, it responds with an \"ok\" to the miner, tricking it into thinking that the block was accepted. The block is then dropped and forgotten, not relayed.\n\nIn doing so, you can \"mine\" dozens (hundreds/thousands?) of mainnet blocks/sec as a test, using real and un-altered miners/pools.\n",

      "message": "mining: introduce -forceminerdifficulty debugging option\n\nThis is intended for debugging mining software only! It allows for real-time\nmining on any chain with the specified difficulty. When this option is set,\nminimum difficulty blocks will be accepted by the submitblock rpc as long as\nthey are otherwise valid.\n\nThis is very helpful for simulating mining on a real chain, without having to\nuse real hashpower.\n\nAdditionally, it does not require any change in rpc behavior, allowing testing\nof miners that cannot be easily changed.",
