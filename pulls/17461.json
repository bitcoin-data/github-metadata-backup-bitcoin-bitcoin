    "body": "This is a follow-up PR to #17435, testing the custom descendant limit, passed by the argument `-limitdescendantcount`. ~~It was more tricky than expected, mainly because we don't know for sure at which point node1 has got all the transactions broadcasted from node0 (for the ancestor test this wasn't a problem since the txs were immediately available through `invalidateblock`) -- a simple `sync_mempools()` doesn't work here since the mempool contents are not equal due to different ancestor/descendant limits. Hence I came up with a \"hacky manual sync\":~~\r\n1. ~~wait until the mempool has the _expected_ tx count (see conditions below)~~\r\n2. ~~after that, wait some time and get sure that the mempool contents haven't changed in-between~~\r\n\r\n~~Like for~~ Similar to the ancestor test, we overall check for ~~three~~ four conditions:\r\n- the # of txs in the node1 mempool is equal to the descendant limit (plus 1 for the parent tx, plus the # txs from the previous ancestor test which are still in) ~~(done by the hacky sync above)~~\r\n- all txs in node1 mempool are a subset of txs in node0 mempool\r\n- part of the constructed descendant-chain (the first ones up to the limit) are contained in node1 mempool\r\n- the remaining part of the constructed descendant-chain (all after the first ones up to the limit) is *not* contained in node1 mempool",

Long timeouts which return early are OK, but short-er timeouts which always wait for the whole timeout are riskier IMO especially when we don't control the runtime.\r\n2) The test doesn't check that the descendants limit is actually enforced, e.g., that MAX_CUSTOM_DESCDENDANTS+1 is *not* in the mempool\r\n3) The Lightning carve out should also get a test, but doesn't need to be here.",

      "body": "@JeremyRubin: Thanks for your review notes! I fully agree to your points 1 and 2 (can't say anything about point 3 yet), they both actually stem from the fact that I can't find a concrete way to express the event of \"_node1 has received all txs from node0_\". As long as I don't know that all txs from node0 have been broadcasted, it is impossible to check that something is _not_ in the mempool on node1 (there could still arrive a tx in the future). That's why I worked with just waiting some time, which is of course ugly. Is there any other way? Can I somehow ask node0 if it has broadcasted to all of its peers?",

While this is still race-conditiony, in most cases the relay should happen immediately, but it's just possible the mempool hasn't synced fast enough.\r\n\r\nThis kind of waiting is more OK, as it's just a test timeout that happens when we're pretty sure it's an error, and we quit the loop most times after one iteration.",
