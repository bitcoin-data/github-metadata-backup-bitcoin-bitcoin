This small change makes it apparent for both static analyzers and humans what the real intention of the code is.\r\n\r\nMy experience is that code that looks like potential mistakes to static analyzers tend to confuse humans too.  I think there is a good case for helping static analyzers (and perhaps humans too?) in this case. It also has the added benefit of getting rid of an unnecessary `memset` call and getting three additional test cases that cover the key length boundaries.\r\n\r\nIn summary I think this change is worth it :-)",
