Secondly, protocols are bypassing them by simply publishing data in other ways, such as unspendable outputs and scriptsigs.\r\n\r\nThe *form* of datacarrier outputs remains standardized: a single OP_Return followed by zero or more data pushes; non-data opcodes remain non-standard.\r\n\r\nCC: sipa darosior ",

This increases the UTXO set size unnecessarily, a harmful effect of having the arbitrary OP_Return output limitations. Your analysis does not take that kind of issue into account.\r\n\r\nRather than do a stream of incremental increases, wasting dev bandwidth, this pull-req simply removes those arbitrary limits.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this kind of non-technical discussion seems off-topic for this pull-req. Best to do it on the mailing list. And furthermore, people have choice - Knots exists. If they wish to enforce these limits on their own nodes they're welcome to run Knots. There's no reason why Bitcoin Core should be forced to take on the maintenance burden of maintaining arbitrary limits that we believe are ineffective, and even harmful.",

If our rationale for loosening the restrictions is \"a bunch of degenerates want to gamble on the blockchain, so that means there's lots of economic demand for such transactions\", then that will become a self-fulfilling prophecy... indeed it already has. Thus the spammers' claim to using bitcoin as a dump-bucket for their altcoin Ponzis will only become stronger over time, while people just trying to use bitcoin to pay for stuff will get crowded out over time. Since fiat VC funding heavily favors the altcoin Ponzis over real-world use cases, it is inevitable that this slippery slope will eventually lead to bitcoin being impossible to use for payments.\r\n\r\nThe best time to turn on spam filters was a couple of years ago, swiftly and decisively. Since we didn't manage that, the second best time is now.",

At the same time this isn't a technically difficult PR that needs thousands of eyes on it. Even if a non-contributor finds a bug and can't report it here, there's plenty of time to fix it in a followup.\r\n\r\nThe conceptual discusion should be continued on the mailinglist, but even there it's counter productive to say things without first reading earlier discussions.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest that people who really want to continue filtering `OP_RETURN` transactions, release a simple fork of Bitcoin Core. Such a patch is relatively straight-forward to maintain and thanks to deterministic guix builds, easy for anyone to audit.\r\n\r\n@polespinasa wrote:\r\n\r\n> The code is already there\r\n\r\nRemoving code reduces long term maintenance cost. Not all code is equal; for code that enforces standardness it's critical there are no bugs in it, so it requires a lot more review / attention / maintenance than other areas.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand it's only a small part of standardness code, hasn't changed in a long time and afaik doesn't cause technical headache in other areas of the code. Reducing code complexity is certainly not the main reason for this PR, but it's a nice extra.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, any time this code is touched there's a risk of of drama, which _is_ a huge resource drain (and therefore comes with opportunity cost).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> The _form_ of datacarrier outputs remains standardized: a single OP_Return followed by zero or more data pushes; non-data opcodes remain non-standard.\r\n\r\nProbably worth keeping `mempool_datacarrier.py` around to at least test this aspect. Alternatively, you could replace the check you dropped from `mempool_accept.py` with one that looks for `scriptpubkey`.\r\n\r\nI'll continue code review in a bit.",

      "body": "> Moderation suggestion: close to non-contributors.\r\n\r\nThis is far more than a small technical change, so the broader community should not be shut out of the discussion or shuffled off to the mailing list.  This is a fundamental change to the nature of what the Bitcoin network itself is in its entirety.\r\n\r\n- Merging this PR means Bitcoin is no longer a decentralized currency.\r\n- Merging this PR means Bitcoin is no longer money.\r\n- Merging this PR means Bitcoin is no longer a store of value.\r\n- Merging this PR means Bitcoin is no longer what users, node runners, etc signed up for and adopted.\r\n- Merging this PR means Bitcoin is no longer Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThat may sound like hyperbole, but it really isn't.  If this PR is merged, Bitcoin as we know it changes forever in the most fundamental way imaginable: The reference implementation explicitly turning the Bitcoin network into an arbitrary data storage system, instead of evolving it as a decentralized currency.\r\n\r\nIt's one thing to not act in the face of an attack. It takes discipline and dare I say courage to act in the face of a heavy attack on a system. So while I wholeheartedly disagree with the refusal to merge bug fixes like #28408, I can partly understand the developers' inaction and fear.\r\n\r\nThis PR on the other hand, is not only a direct attack on the nature of Bitcoin itself, its merge would undermine that same nature in the worst possible way. This type of change should be treated with no less scrutiny than a hard fork, because that's essentially what this is: A fork away from being a decentralized currency towards being decentralized nothingness.\r\n\r\nI don't think the gravity of such a change can be understated. This PR might as well be titled, \"Quickest way to kill the Bitcoin project.\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, since this is going to get merged anyway despite wide community objections, allow me to make a prediction:\r\n\r\n- This PR get's merged.\r\n- Centralized mining pools continue to adopt Bitcoin Core changes like this.\r\n- After some relatively short period of time, there are an incredibly small number of > 83 byte OP_RETURNs mined.\r\n- Headline: See? It wasn't so bad! No abuse of oversized OP_RETURNs.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because the people cramming arbitrary data into the blockchain already have an effectively sanctioned method of doing so that will cost them 4x less in fees, and 4x the arbitrary data size. As someone attacking the network with spam, why would I pay 4x the cost to store my garbage with this PR via OP_RETURN when my current method is ALREADY \"standard\" through Bitcoin Core's stated intention to do nothing about it, AND when done non-standard can give me 4x the data? No-brainer for them.\r\n\r\nSo while this PR is an attack on Bitcoin itself and I hate everything about it (and so should you), it's also completely pointless from a technical and incentives perspective unless combined with something like #28408 to make OP_RETURN the \"proper\" way to store data.",

Although `IsStandard` is already checked for these outputs in the unit tests, i think it is worth having a functional test which exercises both cases as well as tests the bounds (here hitting the maximum standard transaction size).

Although i am sympathetic to the argument of letting more control to the user over what gets into their mempool, i do not see any valid reason why a user would want to set `-datacarriersize`. For obvious reasons, we should not keep options we do not expect to be set. This argument is also brought up in this thread by a vocal aggressive minority of non-contributors to and non-users of the software, who i do not think are representative of the Bitcoin Core users.\r\n\r\n*Edited on request of a moderator to remove unnecessarily inflammatory comments.*",

      "body": "> @wizkid057 your comment borders on off-topic, but I'm not going to hide it\r\n\r\nThanks. As a general note I want to briefly point out that I've personally been a long time contributor to the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. Longer than many/most active devs here. While my contributions haven't been directly to Bitcoin Core code to-date (although there is certainly code of mine passed through to it from me through others from long before I had any need for recognition for such things), there's 10,000+ blocks of \"proof of work\" from my wider efforts out there, thousands of which are from my direct personal efforts.\r\n\r\nJust because someone hasn't made huge code contributions to Bitcoin Core code doesn't mean they're not users or contributors to the underlying ecosystem. So, please don't be quick to judge comments from folks without a \"Contributor\" or other tag.\r\n\r\n> At this point in the PR thread it is new information. \r\n\r\nIn the spirt of that, some additional information that needs consideration:\r\n\r\nIt's worth pointing out a huge difference between the currently \"allowed\" 'inscriptions' method of data storage and unlimited-sized OP_RETURN data storage. By nature of being an exploit, 'inscriptions' have to inject PUSH opcodes along with their arbitrary data. This means when examining the raw on-disk data (with external tools, data recovery, forensic examination, etc) that the data stored _generally_ doesn't get interpreted as the actual data the creator intended it to be (a JPEG, whatever).\r\n\r\nHowever, arbitrary sized OP_RETURN does not have this limitation. An entire file can be serialized directly after an OP_RETURN as-is. So later, when a Bitcoin user goes to do data recovery, or has their system seized by a government and they do a cursory analysis of its contents, both will have to contend with the now completely plaintext arbitrary data that any anonymous person has now effectively forced them to store and/or process on their system in order to participate in the Bitcoin network.\r\n\r\nUse your imagination to see how badly this can turn out for folks, and how badly this could indefinitely stifle adoption of Bitcoin full nodes of any implementation now and in the future, not just Bitcoin Core. \"Oh that [insert objectionable/illegal/etc content present on my PC]? That's not mine I swear.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, we've dodged this by pure happenstance of the mechanisms involved being technically hindered (inscriptions needing PUSHes, OP_RETURN being size limited by standardness), costly (bribe a miner), or otherwise prohibitive (mine your own block). We'll lose the protections once this is merged. Please consider these wider implications before hastily merging such a sweeping change.\r\n\r\n> I also encourage you to take longer arguments like this to the mailing list instead of github.\r\n\r\nI will do so, thanks.",

      "body": "I've historically been -0 on these kinds of restrictions, and as soon as we run into non-trivial usage outside the bounds of standardness, there needs to be strong motivations to keep those restrictions otherwise they become a centralizing force. This is doubly so in a world where witness stuffing is a highly dynamic and well-paid method of publishing arbitrary data on the blockchain, so we're not even accomplishing the ostensible goals of those who oppose removal.\r\n\r\nThere are roughly 3 ways to handle this in an active sense for Bitcoin Core as a project:\r\n1) Expand filtering in a game of cat and mouse that of contributors only @luke-jr is interested in. We have rejected this as a group goal for at least 1.5 years now and I see no motion in the other direction.\r\n2) Turn the dial up a bit to allow known-non-spam use-cases, say 150vbytes per, and multiple outputs per transaction. This would accommodate the cited use-case by Citrea in one output, and add additional overhead allow unbounded data for when this dial is incorrect.\r\n3) Remove the dial and move on. \r\n\r\nProtocols have real _Bitcoin-payment_ reasons to use larger sized OP_RETURNs, and falling to adapt means spamming the utxo set to get around it. The days of manually adjusting this dial is over. \r\n\r\nFor alternative projects like Knots that want to chase the concept of (1), knock yourselves out. I promise I will not come and lobby to increase defaults with apocalyptic visions.\r\n\r\n\r\nconcept ACK, code looks correct. Would be good to take in the additional test suggestions.",

However, they do provide a form of friction if enough people use them; for example, if all mempools refuse transactions with OP_RETURNs above the current limit, spammers have no choice but to use mempool accelerators and pay higher fees for their transactions.\r\n\r\nI also agree that it's better to have people using OP_RETURNs rather than creating outputs that pollute the UTXO set forever.\r\n\r\nI am also concerned that in the future we might see a large scale bypassing of the Core standarness rules, but it’s unclear whether we’ve reached that point yet. We can always reconsider dropping the OP_RETURN limit once it becomes truly problematic - but, and this is a genuine question, are we there yet?\r\n\r\nFinally, as Seccour put it:\r\n\r\n>  Just giving up on fighting spam because they found a new way of spamming is the opposite of what we should do. We should double down and find a way to fight the spam instead of embracing it.\r\n\r\nI don't see a reasonable way to double down and fight the spam, but I don't think it makes sense to embrace it.",

      "body": "> Luckily, blocks and mempool data are stored obfuscated on disk by XOR-ing with a random per-node key. See #28052, #28207.\r\n\r\nThis, admittedly, partly mitigates one objection of mine (out of dozens, to be clear). I recall this was discussed _many_ years ago in #bitcoin-dev, but I didn't know it actually finally martialized. Thanks.\r\n\r\nHowever, unless I'm missing something, it seems regular upgrade paths don't have a mechanism to make any use of this obfuscation. Only new nodes seem to benefit. (My personal Bitcoin Core nodes are ancient, and it seems only fresh nodes benefit. One I've had since I started with Bitcoin in 2011-ish, and have done my best to keep updating it over the years across several machines, just for fun. Yes, I run some Core nodes, Knots nodes, and some other forks.)\r\n\r\nWith that said, there's going to be _thousands_ of users who have followed an upgrade path that did _not_ bring them this very recent (and about to be _very_ necessary) obfuscation protection, like myself, most of which will be completely unaware of what is about the be forced on to their storage devices without their knowledge if this PR, or a future one like it, is in fact merged.\r\n\r\nConsidering the floodgates of absolutely horror this PR is going to bring upon Bitcoin node runners, there absolutely needs to be a way for existing users to protect themselves and retroactively apply this on-disk obfuscation to _existing_ node data, and a firm suggestion to users upon upgrading that they should actually do this... perhaps even forcing it as part of an upgrade if not enabled or explicitly disabled.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if this PR somehow isn't controversial enough to avoid being merged (the excuse given for not merging similar opposing PRs in the past, so hopefully some consistency is applied to this one), merging without such protective functionality widely applied and available to protect existing users seems like the absolute minimum bar to pass to minimize some obvious potential damage to those end users.\r\n\r\nI could probably be convinced to make the effort to write a PR for such obfuscation improving changes if it means helping protect innocent Bitcoin users minimally from the harm that will come from merging this PR, and I'd campaign furiously that people adopt that obfuscation ASAP. This is a necessary stopgap until Bitcoin development as a whole comes to its senses and stops actively enabling/encouraging abuse of the network.\r\n\r\nI presume we don't want to put unsuspecting users in harm's way, and it seems like plenty of reason to put the brakes on hastily merging this PR.",

It is already quite easy to get arbitrarily sized OP_Returns mined, and even Bitcoin Core's standardness rules already allow long byte sequences to get mined and thus included in block*.dat files.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just checked, and Google Chromium v135 at least appears to store cached data on your hard drive verbatim (plus a file header). If even they aren't concerned about unobfuscated random cached data ending up on your hard drive from every website you happen visit, I don't think this is a serious concern for Bitcoin Core. In the very rare case that it is, it's perfectly reasonable to tell people they might want to delete their .bitcoin and resync from scratch to ensure the XOR obfuscation is applied.",

      "body": "> @wizkid057 I need to remind people that Bitcoin Core is not the only implementation out there. It is already quite easy to get arbitrarily sized OP_Returns mined, and even Bitcoin Core's standardness rules already allow long byte sequences to get mined and thus included in block*.dat files.\r\n\r\nBy \"long byte sequences\", I don't know of any way to get more than few hundred bytes in a sequence without a miner's involvement.\r\n\r\nI'm talking about entire real world files without breaks.\r\n\r\nIt's already been pretty well established that these alternate implementations are the exception, not the rule. \r\n\r\nIf it's so simple to get these transactions mined, why would you be bothering to try and remove these rules? 🙃\r\n\r\n> Anyway, I just checked, and Google Chromium v135 at least appears to store cached data on your hard drive verbatim (plus a file header). If even they aren't concerned about unobfuscated random cached data ending up on your hard drive from every website you happen visit, I don't think this is a serious concern for Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nThis isn't even remotely comparable. Everyone knows there's a _huge_ difference between using a browser and ending up with something nefarious on your drive (likely from visiting a questionable site in the first place) that doesn't get redistributed by your browser, no less, than completely opening yourself up to unattended storage of anything an anonymous attacker decides to put in the chain AND you now redistribute that to peers.\r\n\r\nQuite a ridiculous and unserious comparison.\r\n\r\n> In the very rare case that it is, it's perfectly reasonable to tell people they might want to delete their .bitcoin and resync from scratch to ensure the XOR obfuscation is applied.\r\n\r\nIt's not a \"rare case\". The moment someone uses this newly opened attack vector, _every_ Bitcoin user will _need_ this minimal protection _already enabled_. We can't be the one to judge if it's OK for certain arbitrary data to be present on another user's disk without their explicit consent, so there must be a mechanism in place well BEFORE that's an issue for every user.",

The solution to that problem, if you perceive it as such, is to run a fork of Bitcoin Core with different mempool policy, such as Knots.\r\n\r\nEven if this PR is not merged, it's extremely unlikely any of the additional filtering in Knots will be added here (previous attempts failed). So this software can't achieve what you need, while Knots can. It has the exact same consensus code (afaik) and is reproducibly built. Someone could even create and maintain an alternative client with fewer features than Knots and only its transaction filtering.\r\n\r\n> In the very rare case that it is, it's perfectly reasonable to tell people they might want to delete their .bitcoin and resync from scratch to ensure the XOR obfuscation is applied.\r\n\r\nOr we can add a way to retroactively XOR these files. Just open an issue if you need that.\r\n\r\nTo clear the mempool, all you need is to delete `mempool.dat`. A new one is automatically created and will be XOR'd.\r\n\r\nDon't delete your whole data directory, as that includes your wallet. Deleting the `blocks`, `indexes` and `chainstate` directories does the trick. By the way, that procedure also works if you have a pruned node and can't open your wallet anymore because it's too far behind.",

      "body": "> Anything that can appear in your mempool via `OP_RETURN` can already appear as an inscription, at 1/4th the cost for the attacker. \r\n\r\nIncorrect. Because 'inscriptions' are an exploit, they have to break up that data into ~500 byte chunks partitioned by PUSH opcodes. This means the largest contiguous piece of raw data to contend with is ~500 bytes.\r\n\r\nWith unlimited sized OP_RETURN, we now have to deal with ~100KB contiguous pieces of data... 200x more. Far more dangerous from an external analysis standpoint.\r\n\r\nWithout on-disk obfuscation, users are vulnerable to a variety of attacks that end up with virtually no barrier to entry under this PR.\r\n\r\n> The solution to that problem, if you perceive it as such, is to run a fork of Bitcoin Core with different mempool policy, such as Knots.\r\n\r\nAs you're well aware, running Bitcoin Knots doesn't solve this problem (unless all miners use Knots, of course).\r\n\r\nI think you're missing the point of this particular argument. I've tried to make it clear without directly noting the specific attacks, which I thought would be obvious to those with knowledge of the topic. Seems I may be incorrect in that assumption. Let me try one more time.\r\n\r\nMerging this PR lowers the bar for storing large contiguous chunks arbitrary data on the systems of thousands of node runners worldwide from \"you must get a miner to mine this for you\" down to \"you have to broadcast it and pay a fee\".\r\n\r\nThat's a massive change with massive implications.  We're going from a landscape with tolerated data carrying of ~80 bytes alongside an unpatched exploit that can stuff ~500 bytes per chunk disguised as a script.... to keeping the exploit AND adding a method for storing data up to ~100KB in length contiguously... and I'm one of the only ones here with the foresight to know that this will have undermining consequences to the ecosystem as a whole? To the point where entire swaths of users will be unable and/or unwilling to run full nodes, forever, for a variety of reasons?\r\n\r\nAnd no one here is considering these issues at all? That's wild to me, and incredibly disappointing.\r\n\r\nLike I said above, this kind of huge fundamental change needs to be treated with the same level of scrutiny as a fork.  This can't be fast tracked into the code just because. Everyone needs to stop, take 10 steps back, and consider the broader implications. Thus far all I see are people with some authority here trying to sweep those implications and global consequences to the Bitcoin project under the rug as quickly as possible... for reasons unknown.\r\n\r\n> Or we can add a way to retroactively XOR these files. Just open an issue if you need that.\r\n\r\nThis absolutely _must_ be a thing before merging this PR is even remotely considered. If the developers here can't see why that is, then there really is no hope left for this project.  Bitcoin's success as a currency is already on shaky ground with the clear failure to address obvious exploits. If we can and do go down the path of just completely changing what Bitcoin _is_ on a whim, it's kind of pointless to begin with.\r\n\r\nI'd like to believe the people involved here are acting in good faith, are competent, and are willing to look at this from all sides and come to a conclusion on what is best for Bitcoin as a whole.  I've done this, and I can't logically come to any positive conclusion.  It's surprising to me that others either are not doing this at all, or are somehow doing the mental gymnastics needed to avoid inconvenient truths of the matter.",

This means the largest contiguous piece of raw data to contend with is ~500 bytes.\r\n\r\n> With unlimited sized `OP_RETURN`, we now have to deal with ~100KB contiguous pieces of data... 200x more. Far more dangerous from an external analysis standpoint.\r\n\r\nIt would be a reasonable precaution to pre-emptively XOR existing mempools by the next release. Tracking in #32372. _Update: we already do that_.\r\n\r\n> Merging this PR lowers the bar for storing large contiguous chunks arbitrary data on the systems of thousands of node runners worldwide from \"you must get a miner to mine this for you\" down to \"you have to broadcast it and pay a fee\".\r\n\r\nThis can be further subdivided into:\r\n\r\n1. Getting it into a user mempool: this PR indeed lowers that barrier\r\n2. Getting it into a block\r\n  i. this is already trivial with LibreRelay and such, there hasn't been a need to contact miners directly in recent years\r\n  ii. even going directly to a miner requires little sophistication. There's already almost no deterrence against this attack. I doubt many, or any, companies that offer this service run a full suite of virus and other content scanners to check for matches.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go further down this rabbit hole, you would also need to consider p2p traffic. You can already send any node on the planet (even unreachable ones, if they randomly connect to you) any payload. No filter can fix that. The only thing this PR does, is cause nodes to subsequently also broadcast the payload. Perhaps with some ISP deep package inspection system that distinction matters. That would be another good reason to only broadcast transactions over v2 encrypted connections, see #32373.\r\n\r\n> > The solution to that problem, if you perceive it as such, is to run a fork of Bitcoin Core with different mempool policy, such as Knots.\r\n> \r\n> As you're well aware, running Bitcoin Knots doesn't solve this problem (unless all miners use Knots, of course).\r\n\r\nI was referring to the more general objection people have against having non-transaction data on their node (OP_RETURN, inscriptions, etc). That's never going to be \"fixed\" in Bitcoin Core. But the more narrow concern of payloads that trigger e.g. virus scanners seems within scope.\r\n\r\nIt's just that Knots tried to address this by trying to filter all non-transaction data (which they want to do anyway), whereas here we'll have to find another solution (such as encrypted storage and transport).",

Earlier you seemed to vaguely allude to perhaps illegal content but you have yet to actually outline a specific attack and its consequences.\r\n\r\nI'll note that (according to ChatGPT) Ethereum allows 128KB data blobs and Solana allows 10MB data blobs. I'm not saying Bitcoin should strive to be like them, I'm just wondering why the supposed exploit to which you refer has not seemed to have harmed them.\r\n\r\n> To the point where entire swaths of users will be unable and/or unwilling to run full nodes, forever, for a variety of reasons?\r\n\r\nThis claim certainly doesn't make sense, as the PR makes absolutely no changes to the total data throughput allowed on the network.",

Things are simply worse for decentralization with the restrictions in place. There are explicit plans to either use centralized miner infra, or dust the utxo set to get around it and no amount of posturing is going to change that.\r\n\r\nI know  you didn't posit this, but others did: To talk as if this filtering is providing *security* to users is also extreme nonsense unless your attacker model is the attacker's inability to use a website. If there are software updates needed to give users security, _let's do those as well._\r\n\r\n> I don't see a reasonable way to double down and fight the spam, but I don't think it makes sense to embrace it.\r\n\r\nAllowing people to do things on the p2p network vs centralized actors is not an \"embracing\" of it. It's a harm reduction. Bitcoin Core as a project is not taking on transaction filtering as an engineering priority. Status quo for status quo sake is only an argument if you reasonably expect us to gain more information that will change the future direction of the project. \r\n\r\nIt's clear to me that it will not. It's been multiple years now that Bitcoin Core as a project has rejected this as a priority. It's not worth arguing about anymore. \r\n\r\nPeople are free to fork, free to use Knots; I'm also free to not engage with these meta conversations any longer.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nBack to technical discussion, I think leaving the option is in disingenuous: unless 90%+ of users change the default it will have zero effect on what is mined, and will simply result in wasted bandwidth and round-trips for the user changing settings. \r\n\r\n",

They're the result of (mostly) careful engineering and consideration of trade-offs. If you wish to run a policy based on taste, then indeed you'll have to accept the trade-off of code that's less audited. Potentially even code that's poorly designed because it was not driven by careful engineering considerations but rather by ideology. Of course Bitcoin has always threaded a careful balance between those two things.\r\n\r\nThere are good reasons not to support multiple incompatible standardness rules. See #26438 for an explanation. In retrospect we should never have made this configurable in the first place, but that realisation is only a few years old. It also didn't matter as much back when this was introduced, because we didn't have compact blocks.\r\n\r\n@instagibbs wrote:\r\n\r\n> will simply result in wasted bandwidth and round-trips for the user changing settings\r\n\r\nAnd for the user _not_ changing their settings if they peer with such a user.\r\n",

Adhering Bitcoin Core to reality, then, through this change, will benefit the Bitcoin network. It is a simple change, yet effectively resolves the downsides that otherwise will continue to exist and can even get worse (already explained by others). \n\nThe pro-free-market, pro-fee-market, pro-freedom, harm-reduction reasoning behind this change should have been understood and acted upon many many many years ago, as fundamentally nothing has changed with Bitcoin, but it is better late than never to harmonize Bitcoin with reality via this common sense change. \n\np.s.

      "body": "Concept ACK, code looks correct to me. In the past, this limit may have discouraged (i.e. proactively) usage but that ship has sailed. It now has the additional negative effect of pushing usage away from the public network, which is a serious problem worth addressing. If someone has something that is, say, 100B and it's more expensive to use an inscription than to use an OP_RETURN + pay a miner privately, they'd pay a miner. Being able to get rid of `-datacarriersize` on tests is a nice plus.\r\n\r\nYou could consider leaving the options in and just increasing the default to max block size. I don't feel strongly about doing this - the config option would just be a footgun long term - but we did do `-mempoolfullrbf` removal in separate stages. It might make this less controversial.",

      "body": "2. Getting it into a block\r\n>    i. this is already trivial with LibreRelay and such, there hasn't been a need to contact miners directly in recent years\r\n>    ii. even going directly to a miner requires little sophistication. There's already almost no deterrence against this attack. I doubt many, or any, companies that offer this service run a full suite of virus and other content scanners to check for matches.\r\n\r\nEveryone here overestimates the market penetration and actual usage of such things. As someone stated above, there have been over 7M OP_RETURN outputs recently, 30 of which used a miner-based service to exceed the 83 byte limit. Not 30,000. Not 3,000,000.  30.\r\n\r\nSorry, but clearly no one really uses these things to bypass IsStandard for OP_RETURN, and this is also not an excuse to avoid the issue of what this PR can and will do to users.\r\n\r\nWe can not put users in harm's way by fast tracking a sweeping change like this. Get protections in place widely FIRST, then CONSIDER the major change like this one.\r\n\r\n> If you want to go further down this rabbit hole, you would also need to consider p2p traffic. You can already send any node on the planet (even unreachable ones, if they randomly connect to you) any payload. No filter can fix that. The only thing this PR does, is cause nodes to subsequently also broadcast the payload. Perhaps with some ISP deep package inspection system that distinction matters. That would be another good reason to only broadcast transactions over v2 encrypted connections, see #32373.\r\n> \r\n\r\nP2P must also be encrypted by default to protect users from this change. 100%.\r\n\r\n> I was referring to the more general objection people have against having non-transaction data on their node (OP_RETURN, inscriptions, etc). That's never going to be \"fixed\" in Bitcoin Core. But the more narrow concern of payloads that trigger e.g. virus scanners seems within scope.\r\n> \r\n> It's just that Knots tried to address this by trying to filter all non-transaction data (which they want to do anyway), whereas here we'll have to find another solution (such as encrypted storage and transport).\r\n\r\nThat's fine. It's obvious this is being steamrolled through despite clear community objections.\r\n\r\nSo since that's the case, my goal is to protect as many users as possible as much as possible from the fallout.\r\n\r\nRight now that's:\r\n\r\n- P2P encryption must be default and no more clear relay of txn or block data can happen\r\n- On-disk mempool and block data can only exist in an obfuscated form, regardless of their upgrade path.\r\n- Other node implementations probably should be contacted, if possible, to give them a heads up to do similar obfuscation if they haven't already.\r\n\r\nWe MUST mitigate harm to end users as much as possible. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not underestimate the damage this can and will do to Bitcoin and its users, especially without MINIMAL protections solidly in place.",

If this PR is merged, Bitcoin as we know it changes forever in the most fundamental way imaginable: The reference implementation explicitly turning the Bitcoin network into an arbitrary data storage system, instead of evolving it as a decentralized currency.\r\n> \r\n> It's one thing to not act in the face of an attack. It takes discipline and dare I say courage to act in the face of a heavy attack on a system. So while I wholeheartedly disagree with the refusal to merge bug fixes like #28408, I can partly understand the developers' inaction and fear.\r\n> \r\n> This PR on the other hand, is not only a direct attack on the nature of Bitcoin itself, its merge would undermine that same nature in the worst possible way. This type of change should be treated with no less scrutiny than a hard fork, because that's essentially what this is: A fork away from being a decentralized currency towards being decentralized nothingness.\r\n> \r\n> I don't think the gravity of such a change can be understated. This PR might as well be titled, \"Quickest way to kill the Bitcoin project.\"\r\n> \r\n> Anyway, since this is going to get merged anyway despite wide community objections, allow me to make a prediction:\r\n> \r\n> * This PR get's merged.\r\n> * Centralized mining pools continue to adopt Bitcoin Core changes like this.\r\n> * After some relatively short period of time, there are an incredibly small number of > 83 byte OP_RETURNs mined.\r\n> * Headline: See? It wasn't so bad! No abuse of oversized OP_RETURNs.\r\n> \r\n> Why? Because the people cramming arbitrary data into the blockchain already have an effectively sanctioned method of doing so that will cost them 4x less in fees, and 4x the arbitrary data size. As someone attacking the network with spam, why would I pay 4x the cost to store my garbage with this PR via OP_RETURN when my current method is ALREADY \"standard\" through Bitcoin Core's stated intention to do nothing about it, AND when done non-standard can give me 4x the data? No-brainer for them.\r\n> \r\n> So while this PR is an attack on Bitcoin itself and I hate everything about it (and so should you), it's also completely pointless from a technical and incentives perspective unless combined with something like #28408 to make OP_RETURN the \"proper\" way to store data.\r\n\r\n**1. Misrepresentation of Bitcoin’s Nature**\r\nThe author claims merging this PR means Bitcoin stops being money, a decentralized currency, or a store of value. **This is pure hyperbole (even though he says it's not) without any substantive evidence.** Bitcoin's essence isn't altered by accommodating arbitrary data. Bitcoin remains a decentralized, permissionless protocol—exactly what enables its resilience and innovation.\r\n\r\n**2. Fear vs. Empirical Evidence**\r\nThe author's prediction—that Bitcoin would devolve into \"decentralized nothingness\"—is grounded entirely in fear-based rhetoric rather than empirical analysis. Historically, disruptive technologies always grow beyond their initial use cases (PayPal came from eBay, WeChat Pay from WeChat, etc.). Let’s not forget, the original Bitcoin Client v0.1 release by Satoshi had an unfinished poker game and an eBay-style marketplace in the source code. Not to mention, Satoshi supported [selling a JPEG for 500 BTC](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25.msg159#msg159) in 2010. Ordinals and expanded data use-cases via OP_RETURN enhance practical utility without compromising Bitcoin’s foundational decentralization.\r\n\r\n**3. Ignoring Bitcoin’s Adoption Flywheel**\r\nThe author overlooks the critical importance of real-world use cases as key drivers of adoption. Expanded OP_RETURN capability aligns precisely with The Bitcoin Use Cases Theory: more use cases → more adoption → increased user base → stronger Bitcoin network effect. Rather than weakening Bitcoin, such changes are vital for driving mass adoption and economic relevance.\r\n\r\n**4. False Dichotomy of “Spam” and Value**\r\nThe author frames storing data in Bitcoin as “spam,” conveniently ignoring that Ordinals and similar use cases are valued in billions of dollars. Labeling high-value economic activities as “spam” is misleading. Markets, not individual opinions, determine what has value. Clearly, the market finds Ordinals valuable, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a unit of account and medium of exchange.\r\n\r\n**5. Ignoring Historical Precedent of Innovation**\r\nThe author incorrectly asserts that allowing other use cases to be possible will damage Bitcoin irreparably. Yet, historically, things like Ordinals have strengthened Bitcoin, driving greater decentralization (through self-custody) and adoption (new user inflows). Just like how PayPal leveraged eBay (which rose to prominence selling Beanie Babies), Bitcoin can leverage use cases like Ordinals to become robustly adopted peer-to-peer cash.\r\n\r\n**6. Misguided Technical Arguments**\r\nThe author admits the PR change is technically benign—stating attackers already have cheaper methods. Ironically, this undermines their entire argument. If cheaper, more data-intensive methods already exist without harming Bitcoin, why would a more expensive alternative suddenly destroy Bitcoin’s foundational attributes? Their logic contradicts itself.\r\n\r\n**7. No Evidence of Centralization**\r\nThe author's claim about increased centralization is unsubstantiated. Historically, new Bitcoin use cases have incentivized self-custody and decentralization. Ordinals actively motivate moving BTC off centralized exchanges into self-custodied wallets. Thus, innovation fosters greater decentralization, not less.",

Even if fees partially discourage abuse, Bitcoin’s adversarial environment teaches that any opening for data monetization will eventually be exploited.\n\nEvery additional byte recorded imposes a cost not just today but permanently on future node operators, many of whom may not have high bandwidth, storage, or technical resources.\n\nBitcoin must remain accessible to anyone running inexpensive hardware if it is to retain its censorship resistance and neutral verification properties.\n\nOP_RETURN was intentionally designed for small metadata, not bulk storage. Expanding it undermines Bitcoin’s role as a monetary settlement layer and risks repurposing it as a generic data host — a mission creep Bitcoin explicitly avoided.\n\nLong-term decentralization demands that protocol changes bias heavily toward conservatism, not flexibility, particularly where irreversible growth pressures are concerned.\n\nNACK on the grounds of decentralization risk and permanent costs to future node operators.",

      "body": "I have significant concerns about removing the `datacarrier` and `datacarriersize` limits without thoroughly addressing the potential for exacerbating existing attack vectors.\r\n\r\nBitcoin's mempool and network already face challenges from known attack vectors like flood and loot attacks, replacement cycling, and irreversible fee attacks, which exploit transaction propagation and fee mechanics to burden nodes or disrupt confirmation reliability. \r\n\r\nBy removing OP_RETURN limits, we risk introducing new vectors for abuse, such as flooding the network with large, unspendable data outputs, without clear mitigations. These could amplify mempool bloat, increase node resource demands, and potentially incentivise malicious actors to exploit unspendable outputs in ways that compound existing issues, like driving up fees or delaying legitimate transactions.\r\n\r\nWhile provably unspendable outputs are preferable to dust outputs in some contexts, the absence of any guardrails could make it easier for bad actors to stress the network, especially in combination with existing vulnerabilities. I'd suggest a more cautious approach: perhaps retain a configurable upper bound on OP_RETURN size or introduce rate limiting mechanisms to deter abuse while still allowing flexibility. We should also prioritise simulations or testnet experiments to quantify the impact on mempool dynamics and node performance under adversarial conditions.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see this PR paired with robust protections against these risks, as adding potential attack vectors on top of Bitcoin's existing challenges feels counterproductive without them.",

Bitcoin is not for that.\r\nBut the mechanics and economics of the situation dictate that as soon as anyone wants there to be data - there will be data.\r\nGiven that, we have a duty to users to minimise the burden it causes, and this can be economically incentivised.\r\n\r\nop_return is the least burdensome way to store data. Less than as witnesses (inscriptions) or hiding in any of the multitude of other \"real\" fields which will never be blocked until everything is whitelisted.\r\nThe only reason remaining to use inscriptions over a consensus-bound-only op_return for data storage would be either because you want over 1mb in one chunk, or because of the witness discount - which we should retain to encourage UTXO consumption.\r\n\r\nCounterintuitive as it may seem at casual glance, the least-harm path would be removing the various limits on op_return AND providing it a fee rate discount in line with the witness discount. Inscriptions need two transactions to store data, whilst op_return only needs one, so they would fall out of favor for most use cases, and thus free up block space.",

      "body": "> Bitcoin's mempool and network already face challenges from known attack vectors like flood and loot attacks, replacement cycling, and irreversible fee attacks, which exploit transaction propagation and fee mechanics to burden nodes or disrupt confirmation reliability.\r\n> \r\n> By removing OP_RETURN limits, we risk introducing new vectors for abuse, such as flooding the network with large, unspendable data outputs, without clear mitigations. These could amplify mempool bloat, increase node resource demands, and potentially incentivise malicious actors to exploit unspendable outputs in ways that compound existing issues, like driving up fees or delaying legitimate transactions.\r\n\r\nThis is so incredibly vague that it reads like an LLM output. @BrazyDevelopment  nothing in your comment actually specifies a novel attack vector. Nodes already have resource management logic that mitigates the issues you outlined.",

The point is Im deciding whether or not i want a fence and when you push a change that removes the option, you're going to make people furious over nothing... and per you're own argument it wouldn't change anything. If it doesn't change anything then its clearly not needed for any reason. The only reason to even suggest it would be to argue that it does, in fact, change something.\n> \n> Notice I didn't mention whether it was trivial or not to add data, I explicitly brought up the controversy behind the idea and the obvious fact that this is done directly in opposition to what users and node operators are concerned with or care about. Bringing up the same point that's been brought up 15,000 times isn't addressing the issue or solving any problem.\n\nIt's more like Core devs gave everyone a fence by default and the size of the fence was arbitrary. The better solution is to not force everyone to have a fence by default and let people build their own fences however high they want. ",

This is a fundamental change to the nature of what the Bitcoin network itself is in its entirety.\r\n> \r\n>     * Merging this PR means Bitcoin is no longer a decentralized currency.\r\n> \r\n>     * Merging this PR means Bitcoin is no longer money.\r\n> \r\n>     * Merging this PR means Bitcoin is no longer a store of value.\r\n> \r\n>     * Merging this PR means Bitcoin is no longer what users, node runners, etc signed up for and adopted.\r\n> \r\n>     * Merging this PR means Bitcoin is no longer Bitcoin.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> That may sound like hyperbole, but it really isn't. If this PR is merged, Bitcoin as we know it changes forever in the most fundamental way imaginable: The reference implementation explicitly turning the Bitcoin network into an arbitrary data storage system, instead of evolving it as a decentralized currency.\r\n> \r\n> It's one thing to not act in the face of an attack. It takes discipline and dare I say courage to act in the face of a heavy attack on a system. So while I wholeheartedly disagree with the refusal to merge bug fixes like #28408, I can partly understand the developers' inaction and fear.\r\n> \r\n> This PR on the other hand, is not only a direct attack on the nature of Bitcoin itself, its merge would undermine that same nature in the worst possible way. This type of change should be treated with no less scrutiny than a hard fork, because that's essentially what this is: A fork away from being a decentralized currency towards being decentralized nothingness.\r\n> \r\n> I don't think the gravity of such a change can be understated. This PR might as well be titled, \"Quickest way to kill the Bitcoin project.\"\r\n> \r\n> Anyway, since this is going to get merged anyway despite wide community objections, allow me to make a prediction:\r\n> \r\n>     * This PR get's merged.\r\n> \r\n>     * Centralized mining pools continue to adopt Bitcoin Core changes like this.\r\n> \r\n>     * After some relatively short period of time, there are an incredibly small number of > 83 byte OP_RETURNs mined.\r\n> \r\n>     * Headline: See? It wasn't so bad! No abuse of oversized OP_RETURNs.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Why? Because the people cramming arbitrary data into the blockchain already have an effectively sanctioned method of doing so that will cost them 4x less in fees, and 4x the arbitrary data size. As someone attacking the network with spam, why would I pay 4x the cost to store my garbage with this PR via OP_RETURN when my current method is ALREADY \"standard\" through Bitcoin Core's stated intention to do nothing about it, AND when done non-standard can give me 4x the data? No-brainer for them.\r\n> \r\n> So while this PR is an attack on Bitcoin itself and I hate everything about it (and so should you), it's also completely pointless from a technical and incentives perspective unless combined with something like #28408 to make OP_RETURN the \"proper\" way to store data.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut all this is optional to run right? I run a node which does not forward shitcoin data. If enough of us run this then whoever has wanted this is wasting their time?\r\n",

      "body": "Additional Concerns – Concept NACK\r\n\r\nWhile many critical points have already been raised, I’d like to highlight several underdiscussed but significant risks introduced by this PR:\r\n\r\n 1. Fee Market Distortion via “Cheap” OP_RETURNs\r\n\r\nRemoving all limits on OP_RETURNs creates a perverse incentive: transactions can now carry large, non-economic payloads while avoiding long-term storage costs (since OP_RETURNs don’t enter the UTXO set).This allows chain data to be subsidized at rates far below what’s fair in a constrained blockspace market, encouraging chain bloat for effectively free.\r\n\r\n 2. Off-Chain Miner Incentives + Spam Collusion Risk\r\n\r\nA key overlooked threat: miners can be externally compensated to mine low-fee, high-data transactions (e.g., from protocols like inscriptions or private data anchoring services).With this PR making such transactions “standard,” Core relinquishes its main tool to discourage such behavior, potentially enabling coordinated spam attacks that the mempool can no longer filter.\r\n\r\n 3. Legal & Reputational Risk: Malicious Payloads\r\n\r\nExpanding unrestricted OP_RETURN use invites obfuscated data insertion, including hashes of illicit content, malware blobs, or CSAM fingerprints — none of which are visibly labeled or filtered.This could expose node operators (especially in regulated environments) to unintended legal liability and reputational harm.\r\n\r\n 4. Forensics and Spam Detection Blind Spots\r\n\r\nOP_RETURN abuse weakens tools used to detect spam or adversarial behavior, since these outputs are inherently unlinked to future transactions and harder to analyze.This undermines both public monitoring and miner reputation systems.\r\n\r\n⚠️ Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis PR does more than remove “arbitrary limits.” It dismantles policy-level defenses and opens clear attack vectors without adding compensatory safeguards.\r\n\r\nWe should not normalize high-bandwidth, low-fee chain usage under the banner of simplification or user freedom. The unintended consequences are substantial, and under a worst-case model, could degrade the Bitcoin network’s utility for economic transactions.",

Opening this up feels like a step away from its core purpose. Plus, there’s no clear agreement among devs or the community, and there are better ways to handle data needs without going all-in like this. I mean what does this PR achieve other than issues!?\n\nBottom line: this PR’s too risky and doesn’t fit Bitcoin’s vibe. It shouldn’t be merged. ",

      "body": "Concept NACK\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a fundamental shift in Bitcoin's networking model by encrypting peer-to-peer transport via BIP324. While the goals of improving privacy and censorship resistance may seem beneficial, the trade-offs involved are deeply concerning from both a philosophical and technical standpoint.\r\n\r\nLoss of network transparency\r\nBitcoin's peer-to-peer layer has always been observable, enabling traffic analysis, censorship detection, and independent verification of network behavior. Encrypting message payloads obscures this visibility, making it significantly harder to detect censorship, analyze propagation issues, or audit the health of the network.\r\n\r\nSecurity overreach undermines auditability\r\nWhile this change is framed as a security improvement, it primarily obfuscates traffic patterns rather than securing critical data. Tor and I2P already offer transport-level privacy where needed. Introducing encryption at the Bitcoin protocol layer disables legitimate observability without solving meaningful privacy issues on-chain.\r\n\r\nIncreased complexity and maintenance burden\r\nAdding cryptographic handshakes, session management, and encryption layers significantly increases protocol complexity and the potential attack surface. This raises the barrier to entry for contributors and node operators, fostering a more centralized, expert-driven maintenance model over time.\r\n\r\nLack of community-wide consensus\r\nThis proposal effectively deprecates the plaintext P2P layer in the long run. A change of this magnitude requires explicit community-wide consensus, not just implementation-level agreement. Merging such a deep protocol change without broader buy-in risks alienating users and downstream ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis proposal, although technically impressive, erodes key properties that have defined Bitcoin's resilience and trust minimization for over a decade. Any privacy gain should not come at the cost of disabling independent network auditability and transparency.\r\n\r\nStrong Concept NACK.",

      "body": ">The proposed Bitcoin Core change could pose risks to Bitcoin's usability and decentralization by allowing more non-financial data, potentially bloating the blockchain and making it harder for regular users to run nodes. \r\n\r\n>Second, bigger transactions would bloat the blockchain, slowing things down and making it tougher for regular folks to run nodes, which could centralize Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAs https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32359#issuecomment-2840479090 states, this PR does not increase node resources nor make it harder for regular users to run nodes. In regards to mitigating bloat on the blockchain, that's exactly what the motivation of this PR is about. Minimizing the number of unspendable taproot outputs that will forever have to be stored on every node.\r\n\r\nOf all the claims that it will be harder to run a node, I have yet to read one that actually states the technical reasons why running a node would be harder. It would be greatly appreciated if someone can clarify that for me. There shouldn't be any additional storage/bandwidth costs with this change, and if this change does have an impact it would be to reduce UTXO bloat by preventing unspendable outputs.\r\n\r\n>1. Fee Market Distortion via “Cheap” OP_RETURNs\r\n\r\nIf this PR actually has the intended effect, it would actually be more expensive to use data in OP_RETURNs because it is not discounted like the witness data. If you are concerned about subsidizing data storage on the blockchain, then you should want less data storage in the witness (which is the aim of this PR).\r\n\r\n>2. Off-Chain Miner Incentives + Spam Collusion Risk\r\n\r\nMiners are more likely to be externally compensated when the transactions users/companies want mined are non-standard by mempool policies. Imposing data size limits on OP_RETURN in Core's mempool policy actually encourages this behavior, as coordinating privately with miners would be the best option to get txs mined.\r\n\r\n>3. Legal & Reputational Risk: Malicious Payloads\r\n\r\nThis has already been covered, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32359#issuecomment-2836929583.\r\n\r\n>4. Forensics and Spam Detection Blind Spots\r\n\r\nIt sounds to me you are suggesting that being able to do \"public monitoring\" on \"spam\" txs is a good thing, in which case I just fundamentally disagree as this sounds awfully similar to chain analysis. I couldn't follow how this relates to miner reputation systems.\r\n\r\n>I mean what does this PR achieve other than issues!?\r\n\r\nStating its a security mess with no elaboration does not count as an issue. In what way is this a security mess, specifically? Your second issue is not an issue, as addressed above. Your third issue is not an issue, it is a disagreement on what you think bitcoin's vibe should be.\r\n\r\nGiven that OP_RETURN is more expensive than storing data in the witness I am not even sure this PR will make people switch to using the OP_RETURN. However, at least it directionally does encourage less harmful usage of the blockchain which is what most of the ACK rationales seem to focus on. Disappointingly, the NACK rationales seem to mostly center around a philosophy of \"bitcoin shouldn't give into spammers\" which I find to be far less important (and frankly, a complete antithesis to the saying \"bitcoin is for enemies\") than actually finding ways to mitigate the harm that spam does to the blockchain long term.",

The weight of data stored in blocks has a direct impact on the throughput of the system, a property that is as critical for the operations of the system, if not more, than others properties like the size of the UTXO set. \r\n\r\nA given quantity of data stored in a op_return output has a far larger negative externality on the throughput than the same data stored in a witness. On the others hand, data stored in the witness have a small additional cost in terms of block space and a temporary negative impact on the UTXO set. All aspects considered, it would be rational for any honest actor to prioritize storing data in the witness because 1/ it's cheaper and 2/ it's less damaging for the operations of the system.\r\n\r\nFrom a pure engineering perspective, there's absolutely no reason for data stored in op_return outputs being weighted differently from data stored in the witness (see archives of posts explaining the rationale behind the \"discount\" applied to witness data). The real (big) problem is that it would imply that financial bitcoin data cost more than blobs of non-financial data, which is basically the opposite of what we want for a system like Bitcoin...",

Are you telling me that 1 byte of data stored in the witness is weighted like 1 byte of data stored in an op_return output? If it's not the case then I don't see how we can disagree that 1 byte of data stored in an op_return output is more damaging to the throughput of the system than 1 byte of data stored in the witness. The fact that the user pays more fees to the miner doesn't change that.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Ok. I think I get it. You\"re talking about the specific case of the Citrea's project that plans to stores its data directly  in an UTXO and not in the witness, right? Well. I think that pushing this PR for this specific reason is a bad idea but I won't discuss it here since it's not a technical matter (except for the fact that Citrea's design choice is **terribly bad**).",

Nodes already have resource management logic that mitigates the issues you outlined.\r\n\r\nApologies for the \"vagueness\", it was not an LLM output, allow me to clarify... \r\n\r\nI’m not worried about some brand-new attack vector popping up, my concern is that scrapping OP_RETURN limits could make existing ones, like flood-and-loot or mempool spam, way worse.\r\n\r\nTake flood-and-loot: an attacker could stuff transactions with huge OP_RETURN payloads _(think multi-MB within consensus rules)_ to bloat mempools across nodes. This clogs things up, delays real transactions, and jacks up fees as users compete. Sure, nodes have tools like maxmempool or min relay fees, but those are tuned for normal traffic. Massive OP_RETURN data could push smaller nodes to their memory or bandwidth limits, making it harder for them to kick out junk transactions and keep things running smoothly.\r\n\r\nThen there’s replacement cycling with RBF. Attackers could chain big OP_RETURN transactions, swapping them out repeatedly to gum up the mempool with low-value junk. This messes with fee markets, as nodes struggle to sort out what’s worth confirming. It’s not new, but it’s easier and cheaper to pull off without size caps.\r\n\r\nI get that node resource management helps, but it’s not bulletproof, especially against someone with deep pockets. I’d feel better keeping a high but reasonable datacarriersize limit _(say, 100 KB)_ or adding a dynamic cap tied to mempool stress. \r\n\r\nWe should run some testnet attacks to see how bad it could get.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think current defenses already cover here?\r\n",

So, great for the Bitcoin economy imo. \r\n\r\nMore data heavy applications will also supply more potential revenue to miners which creates more economic incentive to drive utility on chain in general.\r\n\r\nHowever, the obvious downsizes is this doesn't introduce any new vulnerabilities, but could simply amplify existing ones like block bloat, spam, and fee distortion. \r\n\r\nSo, I feel a moderate increase is a great compromise between the polarized view points discussed here.

Therefore, it is the duty of Core developers to adjust such open mechanisms and guide users toward usage patterns grounded in formal standards.\r\n\r\nPutting all of these issues aside, perhaps the most critical concern is not the OP_RETURN size limit itself, but rather the removal of the restriction on the number of OP_RETURN outputs per transaction. This implies that, in theory, a block could be filled almost entirely with OP_RETURN data, regardless of any individual size limits.",

There is clearly enough resistance to this PR that it should either be dismissed outright, or its rationale suitably justified to the whole community, whose judgement has been proven correct several times in the past. Yes, this may mean utilising X or Youtube instead of the mailing list or moderated github comments, as uncomfortable as that may be for some, but if there is a solid rationale for this change it should be exposed to the scrutiny of the community. Forcing this change through would be a really bad look.\r\n",

Storing data on the blockchain in its current form is not particularly difficult—that’s precisely what this discussion is about. It can be done in various ways, some more harmful than others.\r\n\r\nAs you noted, if the goal is to make data storage more costly, the effective approach is to have these data transactions competing with other transactions, rather than attempting to exclude them from the P2P network. These exclusion attempt only encourages an out-of-band black market where transactions are sent directly to miners with minimal fees.\r\n \r\n> My 7 years old node go down today, and i'm switching to knots.\r\n\r\nThis change hasn't been merged yet, and Knots is a fork of Bitcoin Core that pulls in changes made in Bitcoin-Core on a monthly basis.\r\nIf you encountered a problem with your Bitcoin-Core node today, you will almost certainly experience the same issue when running Knots as well.",

And literally of any size (even beyond the block limits via chunking techniques). Regardless of the outcome of this conversation, this pathway will remain. Moreover, size-wise / fee-wise keeping bigger data in witness is 4x more blockspace-efficient and cheaper. So there's no incentive to choose OP_RETURN over witness data for significantly bigger data so should not increase bloating risk compared to nowadays. But it may benefit some use-cases (like metadata, identify claims, time-stamping etc.) that otherwise would end up in witness data or other paths and stored permanently vs in OP_RETURN that is prunable, so more long-term beneficial. Hope this makes sense!\r\n",

This change would have prevented Bitcoin's emergent criticism of the existing fiat system from being included. Satoshi stored \"arbitrary data\" in the very first block. To say that such usage is \"spam\" is to ignore Bitcoin's origin.\n\nThe world's most neutral and immutable ledger should be unopinionated towards what the free market would like, and pays for it to include. To say this form of speech is \"spam\" is to attack Bitcoin's mission and purpose.\n\nIncreasing the OP_RETURN limit also avoids issues such as polluting the UTXO set, and including data using riskier and more damaging methods. People will speak through any means necessary, we should not frivolously censor them when such censorship isn't even effective, and makes the problem worse.",

So all spam are valid protocol messages.\r\n\r\nThe reason why these data blobs are considered spam is because they are competing for block space against genuine financial transactions which is the usecase of bitcoin as money - not for storage of arbitrary data. Just because someone is bidding for them off-chain, leading to them finally being part of some future financial transaction does not make it a valid financial transaction in and of itself. That way every store/shop should be hosted on bitcoin, listing all their avaialble products on-chain.\r\n",

The message Satoshi put in the Genesis Block, as well as any messages put in the same way by miners, is called the coinbase field. It is in the input scriptSig. It is by design and it existed before OP_RETURN was added.

      "body": "NACK.\r\n\r\nI've already made comments in the mailing list. To summarize: this change is not necessary for nonstandard OP_RETURN transactions to be relayed to miners via public mempools, nor is it necessary to prevent delays in relay of compact blocks. That said, I don't have strong feelings about removing `OP_RETURN` configuration _limits_, or default configuration changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, removing the `datacarrier` and `datacarriersize` options has not been well justified. Downloading a transaction twice is not the same as downloading it once and uploading it N times. Even if N is 1. Download and upload bandwidth are separate, and on many residential networks, as well as cellular, upload bandwidth is _significantly_ lower. My upload speed is 1/30th of my download speed. Removing these flags will not make mempools more consistent. It will push (and is already pushing) more users to run alternative clients which respect their right to control what the code running on their computer does.\r\n\r\nRunning a node is mandatory to interact with Bitcoin without intermediaries. It's mandatory if you want to validate the chain yourself. Having a mempool is useful _to the individual noderunner_. Justifying a change to the reference implementation by pointing out that 'other clients exist', when other clients exist which already have the change you're attempting to justify is a hypocritical non-argument. There's already a minimum relay option (`blocksonly`), and a maximum relay option (librerelay). The only interesting work to do regarding relay policy is to give users _more_ control over their own resources, not remove existing options for no good reason.\r\n\r\nChanges to the reference implementation increase the maintenance burden of downstream alternatives which don't want to mirror that change, as well as the review burden of every user who wants to check that downstream's changes in the future. These flags haven't cost Core anything over the past decade. A reference implementation should not make frivolous changes, and the removal of these flags is the definition of frivolous.\r\n\r\nAll of my points apply equally to #32406, which is the same change, but delaying removal of these flags by first deprecating them, so in a few releases they can be removed with the justification being \"they're deprecated\".\r\n\r\n**Edit because it doesn't warrant posting another comment**: _please_ refrain from posting LLM generated spam anywhere, let alone Bitcoin development discussion channels (eg: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32359#issuecomment-2869852999). It's transparently not written by a human, adds absolutely nothing to the conversation, is riddled with self-contradictory statements and factual errors, and discourages good-faith dialogue. People want to hear _your_ thoughts, not the output of predictive text with too much hardware thrown at it.",

This increases the UTXO set size unnecessarily, a harmful effect of having the arbitrary OP_Return output limitations. Your analysis does not take that kind of issue into account.\r\n> \r\n> Rather than do a stream of incremental increases, wasting dev bandwidth, this pull-req simply removes those arbitrary limits.\r\n> \r\n> Anyway, this kind of non-technical discussion seems off-topic for this pull-req. Best to do it on the mailing list. And furthermore, people have choice - Knots exists. If they wish to enforce these limits on their own nodes they're welcome to run Knots. There's no reason why Bitcoin Core should be forced to take on the maintenance burden of maintaining arbitrary limits that we believe are ineffective, and even harmful.\r\n\r\nYou have a point.  I will be moving to Knots.  All good.",

      "body": "> Meta-protocols builders will find ways to store data on-chain regardless of the decision here. Currently it's in witness data. So this discussion does not solve any raised questions on storing data and its legality etc. However, enabling data in OP_RETURN does offer a number of benefits. Eg.:\r\n\r\nI agree to this. But  I don't think there are only benefits...\r\n\r\n> * future meta-protocols may choose OP_RETURN as the storage option for their data (instead of witness)\r\n\r\nAnd future undesirable meta-protocols may chose to put their data in OP_RETURN when they otherwise would have stayed away entirely.\r\n\r\n> * this will decrease the data inflow into witness\r\n\r\nHow exactly? The witness is still cheaper.\r\n\r\n> * consequently, this will decrease the growth rates of the UTXO set, helping with node running issues presented above\r\n\r\nThere are cases to be made for users that might chose OP_RETURN to not bloat the UTXO set, but it won't help to avoid a  bad actor to do it anyway. We also know that citrea doesn't care enough about this to change their protocol in retrospect. Would someone like citrea have chosen OP_RETURN if it had no limit in bitcoin core (it still has in other implementations)? We can only speculate. So this is speculation, equally as the idea of getting more meta-protocols using bitcoin if OP_RETURN is limitless, is also speculation. Which argument weighs stronger? I think this is not something for this project to decide. If bitcoin core wants to remain neutral, it should remain neutral on the configurability of this limit also IMHO.\r\n\r\n> * additionally, it's 4x more expensive, so more miner benefits\r\n\r\nThis just contradicts point 2 AFAICS. If it is more expensive than the witness space why would any protocol chose OP_RETURN if they had a choice?\r\n\r\n> Hope this makes sense!\r\n\r\nHalfways. I think you are leaving out important nuances and also potential negative effects of this.\r\nOne other game theoretical aspect I'd like to point out is the fact that miners can be considered mostly aligned with bitcoin's success, since bitcoin price is part of their bottom line. This is relevant because the fear of mining centralization has often been brought up. Meta-protocol developers OTOH have no incentive at all to make bitcoin successful in its monetary function. Given these facts, it is strange to on the one hand argue that meta-protocol developers in general will \"play nice\" by using OP_RETURN instead of less desirable or harmful alternatives and on the other hand assume mining centralization is a given outcome. It's both speculation and IMHO neutrality is to not merge this PR.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "**Reasons to Maintain Limitations on OP_RETURN in Bitcoin**\r\n\r\n**1. Preserve Blockchain Pruning and Scalability**\r\n    * Bitcoin nodes need to process and store all transactions. If arbitrary data could be stored freely via OP_RETURN, it would bloat the UTXO set or blockchain size.\r\n    * Although OP_RETURN outputs are provably unspendable and don't enter the UTXO set, allowing large or unlimited data sizes could lead to excessive permanent data in the blockchain, making it harder for new nodes to sync and validate.\r\n**2. Discourage Non-Financial Use of the Blockchain**\r\n    * Bitcoin was designed primarily for financial transactions, not as a generic data storage layer.\r\n    * Loosening OP_RETURN limits could encourage abuse for data anchoring, spam, NFTs, or arbitrary file storage, which are better suited to layer 2 or external protocols.\r\n**3. Minimize Spam and Abuse**\r\n    * OP_RETURN has historically been used for spam or embedding unrelated data (e.g., advertisements, memes, or even malicious content).\r\n    * Keeping the size limit low discourages use cases that are not aligned with the Bitcoin ethos of minimalism, censorship resistance, and financial sovereignty.\r\n**4. Maintain Consensus Simplicity**\r\n    * The 80-byte limit is well-established and understood by the ecosystem.\r\n    * Raising or removing the limit introduces a consensus-level change, which adds complexity and potential fragmentation—particularly in parsing, indexing, and relay policies.\r\n**5. Support for Alternative Solutions**\r\n    * Applications that need to timestamp, hash, or anchor data can already do so efficiently with the current size.\r\n**6. Relay Policy and Fee Market Impacts**\r\n    * Relaxing the OP_RETURN limit could incentivize low-value, high-size transactions that clog mempools or distort the fee market.\r\n    * It might force nodes and miners to process more data with no economic benefit, increasing bandwidth and validation costs.",

      "body": "Approach NACK\r\n\r\nI can understand the technical reasons for lifting the `OP_RETURN` data limit, but I oppose the removal of node configurability. Both `-datacarrier` and `-datacarriersize` should be retained. Node operators should be able to choose what kind of data they relay without having to rely on other Node implementations that have less developper support.\r\n\r\nEdit: Also, wether it is actually virtue signalling or not, a Node runner should be able to choose not to relay certain data, it is their node, and not activily aiding in the propagation of certain data, which could be considered spam or otherwise unwanted, should be in their right.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I object to allowing multiple `OP_RETURN` outputs per transaction. This may increase mempool complexity, raise attack surface, and introduce ambiguity in interpreting transactions. I suggest limiting transactions to a single `OP_RETURN'.\r\n\r\nEdit: And in the mailing list it was suggested that initially only the data limit would be removed.\r\n\r\nAs there is substantial opposition and no urgency for these changes, the Bitcoin Core policy should be conservative by default,\r\n\r\nEdit: Finally, even though these aren't consensus changes, if the Core maintainers can unilaterally push through these changes, without widespread support from its users (node runners), then that becomes an attack surface in itself.\r\n",
