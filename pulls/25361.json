    "body": "This PR supersedes #20962 and introduces a two-layered cipher suite used in the latest draft of [BIP324](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1378).\r\n\r\n* Inner layer uses [RFC8439](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8439) which comes with a formal [security analysis](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/613.pdf) so any novelty introduced by our cipher suite still offers a baseline confidence in confidentiality and authenticity. The RFC8439 instance is re-keyed every 256 messages for forward secrecy.\r\n* Outer layer uses a forward secure version of ChaCha20, `FSChaCha20` which re-keys itself every 256 messages for forward secrecy. It is used to encrypt the message length resulting in a pseudorandom byte stream.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).",

          "body": "During discussions and reviews of BIP324 (p2p transport encryption), a more efficient AEAD [was proposed](https://gist.github.com/jonasschnelli/c530ea8421b8d0e80c51486325587c52#gistcomment-3527113).\r\n\r\nThe main difference is how the construct implements re-keying. Since both, the original and the new BIP324 AEAD will not repeat the key handshake over time (no re-keying on the ECDH level), a simpler form of *direct* re-keying has been proposed.\r\n\r\nThe new AEAD uses a ChaCha20 stream cipher where byte 4064 till byte 4096 (last 32 bytes in a 4096 window) are used to re-key the same instance. Re-keying in that context means re-setting the ChaCha20 key (thus setting the constant \"expand 32-byte k\" again, resetting the counter) to the last 32bytes of the current 4096 chunk. We never encrypt more than 4096bytes with the same key. On every re-key, we increase the IV by 1 (a sequence number).\r\nThis should allow forward secrecy in the same way as the old (and slightly cumbersome) rekeying approach.\r\n\r\nThe AEAD is currently only used in tests. The serializer and deserializer for the V2 transport are in #23233.\r\n\r\nBIP324 proposal can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dhruv/5b1275751bc98f3b64bcafce7876b489",

This code buffers and reuses those pseudorandom bytes.\r\n\r\nThis improvement is relevant to the new design of BIP324 where:\r\n- One instance of ChaCha20(for encrypting the length) uses only 3 pseudorandom bytes per message, so throwing away 61/64 bytes would be a 95% waste.\r\n- There are efficiencies to be had from being able to send a vector of plaintexts to encrypt rather than creating a concatenated buffer, but that means the block cannot be advanced in between calls.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this also means that our implementation is no longer identical to the reference implementation by Daniel J Bernstein (if I had to guess though, closer to his intention for a stream cipher), and the differential fuzz test against his implementation from #22704 no longer makes sense (if it's not against the pristine version, it does not serve the original purpose)",

An alternative would be to just assert for the minimum size of 16 (and a maximum size of 32), if for some reason supporting keys with a length between 17 and 31 bytes is important; I guess it isn't though, it would also be confusing as the extra bytes wouldn't be used.",

          "body": "Our implementation of ChaCha20 is based on [RFC 7539](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539) which has been declared obsolete by  [RFC 8439](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8439).\r\n\r\nFor example the nonce changed from 64-bit to 96-bit:\r\n> Note also that the original ChaCha had a 64-bit nonce and 64-bit block count. We have modified this here to be more consistent with recommendations in Section 3.2 of [RFC5116]. This limits the use of a single (key,nonce) combination to 2^32 blocks, or 256 GB, but that is enough for most uses. In cases where a single key is used by multiple senders, it is important to make sure that they don’t use the same nonces. This can be assured by partitioning the nonce space so that the first 32 bits are unique per sender, while the other 64 bits come from a counter.\r\n\r\nI have no idea if any of the changes are really material.\r\n\r\nGiven that we plan to use ChaCha20 in MuHash3072 (#19055), if we ever want to write an RFC for that, we should probably use the new version of ChaCha20.\r\n\r\nThis is also relevant for the [BIP-151 followup](https://gist.github.com/jonasschnelli/c530ea8421b8d0e80c51486325587c52), which appears also to based on RFC 7539. Since the original BIP151 is withdrawn and its replacement hasn't been proposed, it's not too late to change that. RFC 8439 also defines ChaCha20-Poly1305, at minimum the test vectors seem different.\r\n\r\nRFC 8439 has some [errata](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/rfc8439):\r\n* bug in Poly1305 pseudo code (2.5.1)\r\n* bug in ChaCha20 pseudo code (2.4.1)\r\n* remarks about constant-timeness for Poly1305",

          "body": "This PR brings together all other BIP324 PRs and enables v2 encrypted P2P transport.\r\n\r\nBuilds on top of PRs: #25361, #23233, #23561, #23432. It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

Both have their uses (in particular, the MuHash3072 code can benefit from multiple-of-64-bytes assumptions), plus the separation results in more readable code. Also, since FastRandomContext effectively had its own (more naive) caching on top of ChaCha20, that can be dropped in favor of ChaCha20's new built-in caching.\r\n\r\nI thought about rebasing #25712 on top of this, but the changes before are fairly extensive, so redid it instead.",

Verifying and testing the current behavior before introducing the new features.\r\n\r\nThe following cases are covered:\r\n\r\n1) Two p2wpkh spending transactions with the same hash are received:\r\nThe first one with segwit data stripped, and the second one with segwit data.\r\n   \r\n   Result ->  the wallet will update the stored tx, saving the witness data.\r\n\r\n2) Two p2wsh multisig spending txes with the same hash but a different witness are received:\r\nThe first is added to the wallet via the mempool acceptance flow.\r\nwhile the second one, is added to the wallet via the block connection flow.\r\n\r\n   Result -> the wallet will NOT update the stored transaction. The first received transaction\r\nwill take precedence over any following-up transaction. Detached to the fact that the\r\noriginal transaction didn't get into a block and the second one did.\r\n\r\nExtra Note:\r\nDid it on an unit test merely because wanted to review other parts of the sources while was doing it. Could migrate it into a functional test if reviewers wants it as well.",

          "body": "A memory resource similar to `std::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource`, but optimized for node-based containers. The goal is to be able to cache more coins with the same memory usage, and allocate/deallocate faster.\r\n\r\nThis is a reimplementation of #22702. The goal was to implement it in a way that is simpler to review & test\r\n\r\n* There is now a generic `PoolResource` for allocating/deallocating memory. This has practically the same API as `std::pmr::memory_resource`. (Unfortunately I cannot use std::pmr because libc++ simply doesn't implement that API).\r\n* Thanks to sipa there is now a fuzzer for PoolResource! On a fast machine I ran it for ~770 million executions without finding any issue.\r\n\r\n* The estimation of the correct node size is now gone, PoolResource now has multiple pools and just needs to be created large enough to have space for the unordered_map nodes.\r\n\r\nI ran benchmarks with #22702, mergebase, and this PR. Frequency locked Intel i7-8700, clang++ 13.0.1 to reindex up to block 690000.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbitcoind -dbcache=5000 -assumevalid=00000000000000000002a23d6df20eecec15b21d32c75833cce28f113de888b7 -reindex-chainstate -printtoconsole=0 -stopatheight=690000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe performance is practically identical with #22702, just 0.4% slower. It's ~21% faster than master:\r\n\r\n![Progress in Million Transactions over Time(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/173288685-91952ade-f304-4825-8bfb-0725a71ca17b.png)\r\n\r\n![Size of Cache in MiB over Time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/173291421-e6b410be-ac77-479b-ad24-5fafcebf81eb.png)\r\nNote that on cache drops mergebase's memory doesnt go so far down because it does not free the `CCoinsMap` bucket array.\r\n\r\n![Size of Cache in Million tx over Time(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/173288703-a80c9c9e-93c8-4a16-9df8-610c89c61cc4.png)\r\n",

          "title": "doc: Bump copyright years to present (headers only)",
          "body": "The copyright years have many issues:\r\n\r\n* They may be wrong. For example, this can happen when code is moved from one file to a different one without taking over the copyright years. Or it may happen when the wrong years are inserted by a script or developer.\r\n* They are redundant. `git` already tracks the author date for every line of code in every commit.\r\n* They are not needed to establish \"copyright\", see https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/copyright-notices-in-open-source-software-projects/, or https://reuse.software/faq/#years-copyright. Also, anyone who needs them for legal reasons would need to discover the ground truth themselves anyway. For example, with `git blame`, or `git log ...`, or by other means.\r\n* They cause pointless churn. See for example commit 306ccd4927a2efe325c8d84be1bdb79edeb29b04, or drive-by contributions bumping them.\r\n* Many modern open source software projects never added them in the first place, or already removed them, see section below.\r\n\r\nIn theory they can be removed completely. While this should be legally fine, some contributors raised legal uncertainty. So instead, bump each year range one final time  to `-present` and leave the initial year untouched.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a URL redirect is resolved in the second commit.\r\n\r\nFinally, the `_COPYRIGHT_YEAR` build constant is kept untouched, and still expected to be bumped every year, see for example commit 06dd571534c8ecdf7ade77546fcf3a56b3651f68. In theory it could be bumped to `-present` as well, but this change would cause user-visible changes, so discussion should be done in a separate thread.\r\n\r\nExamples of removed years in other projects:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc (Done before accepting external contributions?)\r\n* https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2bc1d775f510196154283374284f98d3eae03544 (Not legally reviewed?)\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nExamples of no years in other projects:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blame/2d66dc44f5abef975bed86af12cb5facb6729a1a/src/renderer/base/FontInfoBase.cpp#L1\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/33f35b04ef0f32f25624a6be59f8635675e3e131/packages/compiler/src/chars.ts#L3\r\n* https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blame/27b8f54f5174aa4d8ea254a7efefd7110b247c17/clang/lib/Basic/Targets/X86.cpp#L4-L5\r\n* ...",

          "title": "test/BIP324: functional tests for v2 P2P encryption",
          "body": "This PR introduces support for v2 P2P encryption(BIP 324) in the existing functional test framework and adds functional tests for the same.\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n3. this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    - `v2_state` is the object of class `EncryptedP2PState` in `P2PConnection` used to store its keys, session-id etc.\r\n    - a node [advertising](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#advertising-to-support-v2-p2p) support for  v2 P2P is different from a node actually [supporting v2 P2P](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#supporting-v2-p2p) (differ when false advertisement of services occur)\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `supports_v2_p2p` in `P2PConnection` to denote if it supports v2 P2P.\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `advertises_v2_p2p` to denote whether `P2PConnection` which mimics peer behaviour advertises V2 P2P support. Default option is `False`.\r\n    - In the test framework, you can create Inbound and Outbound connections to `TestNode`\r\n        1. During **Inbound Connections**, `P2PConnection` is the initiator [`TestNode` <--------- `P2PConnection`]\r\n            - Case 1:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` advertises/signals v2 P2P support (means `self.nodes[i]` set up with `\"-v2transport=1\"`), different behaviour will be exhibited based on whether:\r\n                    1. `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P\r\n                    2. `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P\r\n               - In a real world scenario, the initiator node would intrinsically know if they support v2 P2P based on whatever code they choose to run. However, in the test scenario where we mimic peer behaviour, we have no way of knowing if `P2PConnection` should support v2 P2P or not. So `supports_v2_p2p` boolean variable is used as an option to enable support for v2 P2P in `P2PConnection`.\r\n              - Since the `TestNode` advertises v2 P2P support (using \"-v2transport=1\"), our initiator `P2PConnection` would send:\r\n                1. (if the `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                2. (if the `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n           - Case 2:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` doesn't signal v2 P2P support; `P2PConnection` being the initiator would send version message to initiate a connection.\r\n       2. During **Outbound Connections** [TestNode --------> P2PConnection]\r\n           - initiator `TestNode` would send:\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n          - Suppose `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P support when it actually doesn't support v2 P2P (false advertisement scenario)\r\n               - `TestNode` sends ellswift + garbage bytes\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives but can't process it and disconnects.\r\n               - `TestNode` then tries using v1 P2P and sends version message\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives/processes this successfully and they communicate on v1 P2P\r\n\r\n4. the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n5. includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.\r\nAlso written a more elaborate explanation here - https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md",

      "body": "> Addressed review by @theStack.\r\n\r\nThanks! Another (non-blocking) suggestion: considering that the keys for RFC8439 have a fixed size, would it be worth it to introduce a `RFC8439Key` type that uses `std::array<std::byte, RFC8439_KEYLEN>`? I feel that's the slightly cleaner interface with enforcing the length already at compile-time, and we could remove the asserts in the `RFC8439Encrypt`/`RFC8439Decrypt` functions. The only annoying part is that the test/benchmark/fuzz code gets a bit longer, as one needs to convert from vector to array, and for the zero_key, one can't use the comfortable constructor for initializing the object with a repeated count of items.",

It has the property that *every* 64-byte array is a valid encoding for some public key, and every key has approximately $2^{256}$ encodings. Furthermore, it is possible to efficiently generate a uniformly random encoding for a given public key or private key. This is used for the key exchange phase in BIP324, to achieve a byte stream that is entirely pseudorandom, even before the shared encryption key is established.",

The currently implemented one uses a 64-bit nonce and a 64-bit block counter, while the one used in RFC8439 (and thus BIP324) uses a 96-bit nonce and 32-bit block counter. This PR changes the logic to use the 96-bit nonce variant, though in a way that's compatible with >256 GiB output (by automatically incrementing the first 32-bit part of the nonce when the block counter overflows).\r\n\r\nFor those who reviewed the original PR, the biggest change is here that the 96-bit nonce is passed as a Nonce96 type (pair of 32-bit + 64-bit integer) rather than a 12-byte array.\r\n",

However, the RFC8439 authenticated encryption (as used in BIP324, see #27634) scheme makes use of Poly1305 in a way where the message consists of 3 different pieces:\r\n* The additionally authenticated data (AAD), padded to 16 bytes.\r\n* The ciphertext, padded to 16 bytes.\r\n* The length of the AAD and the length of the ciphertext, together another 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nImplementing RFC8439 using the existing `poly1305_auth` function requires creating a temporary copy with all these pieces of data concatenated just for the purpose of computing the tag (the approach used in #25361).\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the poly1305 code with new code from https://github.com/floodyberry/poly1305-donna (with minor adjustments to make it match our coding style and use our utility functions, documented in the commit) which supports incremental operation, and then adds a C++ wrapper interface using std::byte Spans around it, and adds tests that incremental and all-at-once computation match.",
