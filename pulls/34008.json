    "body": "Previously, when `debug=net` is enabled, we log \"New [..] peer connected\" for new inbound peers with `LogInfo`. However, `LogInfo` will get rate-limited since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32604. When we specifically turn on `debug=net`, we don't want these log messages to be rate-limited.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, use `LogDebug(BCLog::NET, ...)` for potentially high-rate inbound connections. Otherwise use `LogInfo`. This means we don't rate-limit the messages for inbound peers when `debug=net` is turned on but will rate-limit if we created outbound at a high rate as these are logged via `LogInfo`.\r\n\r\nThe new log messages look similar to:\r\n```\r\n2025-12-08T00:00:00Z [net] New inbound peer connected: transport=v2 version=70016 blocks=0 peer=1\r\n2025-12-08T00:00:00Z New outbound-full-relay peer connected: transport=v2 version=70016 blocks=281738 peer=5\r\n```\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI ran into this message getting rate-limited on one of my monitoring nodes with `-logsourcelocations=1`: With logsourcelocations, one of these lines is about 338 chars (or 338 bytes) long. We rate-limit after more than 1048576 bytes per hour, which results in about 3100 in- and outbound connections per hour. With evicted and instantly reconnecting connections from an entity like LinkingLion, this can be reached fairly quickly.",

Updated the commit message an PR description accordingly.\r\n- Switched to AJ's suggestion from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/34008#discussion_r2596296831 to only have minimal code duplication. This logs all new outbound connections with `LogInfo()`, which can potentially get rate-limited, and logs inbound connections with `LogDebug(BCLog::NET, ...)` which is only active with `-debug=net` and won't get rate-limited. Also, a high rate of inbound connections won't affect logging of outbound connections anymore.\r\n\r\nThe new log messages look similar to:\r\n```\r\n2025-12-08T00:00:00Z [net] New inbound peer connected: transport=v2 version=70016 blocks=281738 peer=1\r\n2025-12-08T00:00:00Z New outbound-full-relay peer connected: transport=v2 version=70016 blocks=281738 peer=5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n> 🚧 At least one of the CI tasks failed. Task `macOS-cross to x86_64`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/20027106754/job/57426926798 LLM reason (✨ experimental): Build failed due to use of std::format not available in the current compiler/libc++ setup.\r\n\r\nNot using `std::format` as that's not yet supported in our macOS CI. If `std::format` is wanted as a replacement for `strprintf`, then that's probably a project for someone else and out of scope here. Keeping `strprintf` for now.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis is ready for review again. Also consider the alternative proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/34018. ",

However, `LogInfo` will get\nrate-limited since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32604.\nWhen we specifically turn on `debug=net`, we don't want these log\nmessages to be rate-limited.\n\nTo fix this, use `LogDebug(BCLog::NET, ...)` for potentially high-\nrate inbound connections. Otherwise use `LogInfo`. This means we\ndon't rate-limit the messages for inbound peers when `debug=net`\nis turned on but will rate-limit if we created outbound at a high\nrate as these are logged via `LogInfo`.\n\n--\n\nI ran into this message getting rate-limited on one of my monitoring\nnodes with `-logsourcelocations=1`: With logsourcelocations, one of\nthese lines is about 338 chars (or 338 bytes) long. We rate-limit\nafter more than 1048576 bytes per hour, which results in about\n3100 in- and outbound connections per hour. With evicted and\ninstantly reconnecting connections from an entity like LinkingLion,\nthis can be reached fairly quickly.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Eugene Siegel <elzeigel@gmail.com>\nCo-Authored-By: Anthony Towns <aj@erisian.com.au>\n",

However, `LogInfo` will get\nrate-limited since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32604.\nWhen we specifically turn on `debug=net`, we don't want these log\nmessages to be rate-limited.\n\nTo fix this, use `LogDebug(BCLog::NET, ...)` for potentially high-\nrate inbound connections. Otherwise use `LogInfo`. This means we\ndon't rate-limit the messages for inbound peers when `debug=net`\nis turned on but will rate-limit if we created outbound at a high\nrate as these are logged via `LogInfo`.\n\n--\n\nI ran into this message getting rate-limited on one of my monitoring\nnodes with `-logsourcelocations=1`: With logsourcelocations, one of\nthese lines is about 338 chars (or 338 bytes) long. We rate-limit\nafter more than 1048576 bytes per hour, which results in about\n3100 in- and outbound connections per hour.

If someone feels strongly, I'm very happy to change it to something better! There are two alternatives that came to mind:\n\n1. Use a macro to avoid duplicating the log statements: Not sure if we want to define a macro extra for this, but could be done. This was my initial approach I dismissed.\n2. Extract the log message string and format it with e.g. `std::format()` first, then pass it to either one of the two log macros. This would mean this log message is the only one not formatted with tinyformat..",
