    "body": "This re-adds unreachable code detection for Python based on `vulture`.\r\n\r\nEffectively, this reverts f4beb4996d27f2cdaf4f0a63e7dc044bf17decce. The difference to the previous version is that this runs with the `--min-confidence 100` setting. From https://pypi.org/project/vulture/: \r\n\r\n> Use `--min-confidence 100` to only report code that is guaranteed to be unused within the analyzed files.\r\n\r\nSo this should avoid the previous issues where static analysis had wrong positives due to the dynamic nature of Python code by only reporting things that are unambiguous (such as code after a `return` statement). As such, there is not suppressions list.\r\n\r\nMy motivation was mainly #21081 which would have been caught by this (as can be seen by the CI run failing). This is still marked as draft because #21081 is needed to get the linter to pass. Also, there is a second problem that this found (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509/files#r571454691). From what I can tell, this is a spurious type comment that could just be removed (or if that line has no side effects it could also be deleted altogether?). I could add a commit here to fix it, but I wanted to see if there is interest in having this linter again in the first place",

      "body": "@laanwj I'm not going to spend too much time arguing, but the rationale for #16961 was to avoid false positives. `--min-confidence=100` accomplished that, since it is guaranteed to only find dead code (inside of `if (false)`, after return statement or similar). So there isn't any need to fine-tune anything. This is just a little sanity check that even on my five year old laptop completes in less than one second, and it would have caught an instance of xkcd 221 in the taproot tests, which is probably one of the better-reviewed PRs. What's not to like?",
