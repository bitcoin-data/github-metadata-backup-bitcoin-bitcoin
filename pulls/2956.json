      "body": "I saw a really interesting multi-step failure from an experienced Bitcoin user:\n\nThey imported a private key from some third party (I didn't ask I assume it was a contest or something).\n\nMuch later they needed to receive some Bitcoin so they picked an address of their receive page.\n\nSometime after that they noticed a transaction they didn't make taking some of their bitcoin.\n\nThey eventually figured out that they'd picked that imported key and send coin there and someone else eventually noticed and spent it.\n\nDiscussion about this (\"Why would someone pull an address from the list??\") resulted in me discovering that we were prompting for a password on new addresses (now fixed).\n\nBut just another point to confirm my agreement with @wumpus that we should probably bury the lists as historical data, and have a receive page like Armory's.\n",
