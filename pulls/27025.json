    "body": "The new YAML templates provide more flexibility and can be designed to extract more information from users when submitting issues, avoiding initial back-and-forth when reports do not include enough background information to begin with.\r\n\r\nKey differences:\r\n\r\n* YAML format\r\n* Allows us to require responses to certain questions\r\n* Not currently compatible with GitLab (.md only)\r\n\r\nThis does keep the \"Blank Issue\" option at the bottom.\r\n\r\nTesting this must be done with the master branch of the repo, which is slightly annoying for this repo. I have therefore pushed this to my own fork so that you can see the new templates, along with how the output is rendered in newly-created issues:\r\n\r\n[github.com/willcl-ark/bitcoin/issues](https://github.com/willcl-ark/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)\r\n\r\nI did make some minor changes to some of the template wording, but this change could also be a good time to add/remove additional questions.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a net-positive for me, setting aside the issue that if we ever migrated away from GitHub these might have to be ported back to *.md (or something else), but that seems easy-enough that this change would be worth it.\r\n\r\nCurious to know what others think of this, and whether they would suggest adding any other questions to any of the templates as part of this update?",

If there is a preference to remove the second row, \"Bitcoin Core Security Policy\" direct link, then we could do that?",
