    "body": "Part of cluster mempool (#30289). Builds on top of #31444.\r\n\r\nDuring reorganisations, it is possible that dependencies get added which would result in clusters that violate policy limits (cluster count, cluster weight), when linking the new from-block transactions to the old from-mempool transactions. Unlike RBF scenarios, we cannot simply reject the changes when they are due to received blocks. To accommodate this, add a `TxGraph::Trim()`, which removes some subset of transactions (including descendants) in order to make all resulting clusters satisfy the limits.\r\n\r\nConceptually, the way this is done is by defining a rudimentary linearization for the entire would-be too-large cluster, iterating it from beginning to end, and reasoning about the counts and weights of the clusters that would be reached using transactions up to that point. If a transaction is encountered whose addition would violate the limit, it is removed, together with all its descendants.\r\n\r\nThis rudimentary linearization is like a merge sort of the chunks of the clusters being combined, but respecting topology. More specifically, it is continuously picking the highest-chunk-feerate remaining transaction among those which have no unmet dependencies left. For efficiency, this rudimentary linearization is computed lazily, by putting all viable transactions in a heap, sorted by chunk feerate, and adding new transactions to it as they become viable.\r\n\r\nAs part of this, the \"oversized\" property is expanded to also encompass a configurable cluster weight limit (in addition to cluster count limit). \r\n",

      "message": "txgraph: (optimization) track multiple potential would-be clusters in Trim\n\nIn a Trim function, for any given would-be group of clusters, a (rudimentary)\nlinearization for the would-be cluster is constructed on the fly by adding\neligible transactions to a heap. This continues until the total count or\nsize of the transaction exists a configured limit. Any transactions which\nappear later in this linearization are discarded.\n\nHowever, given that transactions at the end are discarded, it is possible that\nthe would-be cluster splits apart into multiple clusters. And those clusters\nmay well permit far more transactions before their limits are reached.\n\nTake this into account by using a union-find structure inside TrimTxData to\nkeep track of the count/size of all would-be clusters that would be formed\nat any point.",
