    "body": "Part of cluster mempool (#30289). Builds on top of #31444.\r\n\r\nDuring reorganisations, it is possible that dependencies get added which would result in clusters that violate policy limits (cluster count, cluster weight), when linking the new from-block transactions to the old from-mempool transactions. Unlike RBF scenarios, we cannot simply reject the changes when they are due to received blocks. To accommodate this, add a `TxGraph::Trim()`, which removes some subset of transactions (including descendants) in order to make all resulting clusters satisfy the limits.\r\n\r\nConceptually, the way this is done is by defining a rudimentary linearization for the entire would-be too-large cluster, iterating it from beginning to end, and reasoning about the counts and weights of the clusters that would be reached using transactions up to that point. If a transaction is encountered whose addition would violate the limit, it is removed, together with all its descendants.\r\n\r\nThis rudimentary linearization is like a merge sort of the chunks of the clusters being combined, but respecting topology. More specifically, it is continuously picking the highest-chunk-feerate remaining transaction among those which have no unmet dependencies left. For efficiency, this rudimentary linearization is computed lazily, by putting all viable transactions in a heap, sorted by chunk feerate, and adding new transactions to it as they become viable.\r\n\r\nAs part of this, the \"oversized\" property is expanded to also encompass a configurable cluster weight limit (in addition to cluster count limit). \r\n",
