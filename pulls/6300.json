    "body": "Based on IRC talks, renamed RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY to RPC_NOT_FOUND and made getblockhash return NOT_FOUND when block is above the current height.\n\nSome chat excerpts, which started earlier on the fact the error code changed in 10.x for out of range getblockhash requests:\n\n```\n<wumpus> RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER           = -8,  //! Invalid, missing or duplicate parameter\n<wumpus> that's a strange error code to return for a non-existing block\n* splix has quit (Remote host closed the connection)\n<dermoth> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git\n<wumpus> are you providing a valid hash?\n<dermoth> oops\n<dermoth> 2ffdf21ce39fc3133fc\n<dermoth> that's the commit\n* Aido (~Aido@178.167.130.193.threembb.ie) has joined #bitcoin-dev\n<dermoth> parameter is a block number, app used to rely on error -1 to know when it reached the most recent block\n<wumpus> -1 is the general error, -8 is a more specialized one\n<dermoth> I see\n* hsmiths has quit (Quit: END OF LINE)\n<gmaxwell> error: {\"code\":-8,\"message\":\"Block height out of range\"}\n<wumpus> I think a NOT_FOUND code would be more appropriate than invalid parameter (which hints at a parse error),but don't be afraid I won't change it again...\n<dermoth> agreed\n<wumpus> at least the message is clear\n```\n\nand later on...\n\n```\n<dermoth> closest error IMHO, in existing code, is RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY\n<wumpus> indeed. We've been using that as a NOT_FOUND.\n<wumpus> maybe renaming it would be an idea\n<wumpus> as said, those error names are back-projected by me, the original codebase used bare numbers without any explanation\n<dermoth> would you keep the current one as an alias? I can submit a pr\n<wumpus> yes, good idea\n<dermoth> if (nHeight < 0... should be NOT FOUND too?\n<dermoth> I see where the invalid param comes from, maybe split it up then\n<wumpus> bleh.\n<wumpus> see why this was never addressed? you lift it in one place, and notice the whole fabric is coming apart :-)\n<wumpus> I mean I'm sure RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY is also used in many cases where it really means RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER\n<wumpus> before you know it, you're breaking the entire API\n* abossard (~andre@46.140.123.2) has joined #bitcoin-dev\n<wumpus> (and maybe that's for the best, but then it will be a fully fledged RPC return values redesign, and you would have accomplished exactly what you were coming here to complain about in the first place - hehe)\n<wumpus> but maybe there's a middle way, I don't know, thanks for looking into it.\n```\n\nThe change has been tested with the backward-compatible alias commented out:\n\n```\n<dermoth> wumpus, tested ok\n<dermoth> $ ~/bitcoin/bitcoin/bin/bitcoin-cli getblockhash -1\n<dermoth> error: {\"code\":-8,\"message\":\"Negative block height\"}\n<wumpus> great, time to submit a PR then\n<dermoth> $ ~/bitcoin/bitcoin/bin/bitcoin-cli getblockhash 361428\n<dermoth> error: {\"code\":-5,\"message\":\"Block height out of range\"}\n<dermoth> $ ~/bitcoin/bitcoin/bin/bitcoin-cli getblockhash 361424\n<dermoth> 000000000000000004fd86600f6a12e5186ec18f11d7502afba3b7f7e00cae1a\n<dermoth> used the 10.2 client though, but was runnign the 0.11-blarhs-dirty one (dirty bc of the commented out alias)\n<dermoth> v0.11.99.0-fa19502-dirty (64-bit)\n```\n",

Since a lot of the `INVALID_ADDRESS` were basically meaning \"address not found\" I changed the error code for the validity checks to `INVALID_PARAMETER`, so `INVALID ADDRESS` can be cleanly renamed to `NOT_FOUND` with a broader use case (such as looking up blocks that doesn't exist).\n\nRegards,\n",
