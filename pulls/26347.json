The following RPCs need the passphrase when rescanning:\r\n    - `importdescriptors`\r\n    - `rescanblockchain`\r\n\r\nThe following RPCs use the information about whether or not the\r\npassphrase is being used to ensure that full rescans are able to\r\ntake place (meaning the following RPCs should not be able to run\r\nif a rescan requiring the wallet to be unlocked  is taking place):\r\n    - `walletlock`\r\n    - `encryptwallet`\r\n    - `walletpassphrasechange`\r\n  \r\n`m_relock_mutex` is also introduced so that the passphrase is not\r\ndeleted from memory when the timeout provided in\r\n`walletpassphrase` is up and the wallet is still rescanning.\r\nFixes #25702, #11249\r\n\r\nThanks to achow101 for coming up with the idea of using a new mutex to solve this issue and for answering related questions.",

          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

          "body": "`SecureString` is a `std::string` specialization with a secure allocator. However, in practice it's treated like a C- string (no explicit length and null-terminated). This can cause unexpected and potentially insecure behavior. For instance, if a user enters a passphrase with embedded null characters (which is possible through Qt and the JSON-RPC), it will ignore any characters after the first null, potentially giving the user a false sense of security.\r\n\r\nInstead of assigning to `SecureString` via `std::string::c_str()`, assign it via a `std::string_view` of the original. This explicitly captures the size and still doesn't make any extraneous copies in memory.\r\n\r\nNote to reviewers, the following all compile identically in recent `GCC` (x86-64 and ARM64) with `-O2` (and `-std=c++17`):\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nstd::string orig_string;\r\nstd::cin >> orig_string;\r\nSecureString s;\r\ns.reserve(100);\r\n// The following all compile identically\r\ns = orig_string;\r\ns = std::string_view{orig_string};\r\ns.assign(std::string_view{orig_string});\r\ns.assign(orig_string.data(), orig_string.size());\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it's largely a matter of preference. However, one thing to keep in mind is that we want to avoid making unnecessary copies of any sensitive data in memory. \r\n\r\nSomething like `SecureString s{orig_string};` is still invalid and probably unwanted in our case, since it'd get treated as a short string and optimized away from the secure allocator. I presume that's the reason for the `reserve()` calls.\r\n\r\nFixes #27067.",

          "title": "Wallet: Zero out wallet master key upon locking so it doesn't persist in memory",
          "body": "When an encrypted wallet is locked (for instance via the RPC `walletlock`), the documentation indicates that the key is removed from memory:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b92d609fb25637ccda000e182da854d4b762eee9/src/wallet/rpc/encrypt.cpp#L157-L158\r\n\r\nHowever, the vector (a `std::vector<unsigned char, secure_allocator<unsigned char>>`) is merely _cleared_. As it is a member variable, it also stays in scope as long as the wallet is loaded, preventing the secure allocator from deallocating. This allows the key to persist indefinitely in memory. I confirmed this behavior on my macOS machine by using an open-source third party memory inspector (\"Bit Slicer\"). I was able to find my wallet's master key in Bit Slicer after unlocking and re-locking my encrypted wallet. I then confirmed the key data was at the address in LLDB.  \r\n\r\nThis PR manually fills the bytes with zeroes before calling `clear()` by using our `memory_cleanse` function, which is designed to prevent the compiler from optimizing it away. I confirmed that it does remove the data from memory on my machine upon locking.\r\n\r\nNote: An alternative approach could be to call `vMasterKey.shrink_to_fit()` after the `clear()`, which would trigger the secure allocator's deallocation. However, `shrink_to_fit()` is not _guaranteed_ to actually change the vector's capacity, so I think it's unwise to rely on it.\r\n\r\n## Edit: A little more clarity on why this is an improvement. \r\n\r\nSince `mlock`ed memory is guaranteed not to be swapped to disk and our threat model doesn't consider a super-user monitoring the memory in realtime, why is this an improvement? Most importantly, consider hibernation. Even `mlock`ed memory may get written to disk. From the `mlock` [manpage](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html):\r\n\r\n> (But be aware that the suspend mode on laptops and some desktop computers will save a copy of the system's RAM to disk, regardless of memory locks.)\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this is true of [Windows](https://web.archive.org/web/20190127110059/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140207-00/?p=1833#:~:text=%5BThere%20does%20not%20appear%20to%20be%20any%20guarantee%20that%20the%20memory%20won%27t%20be%20written%20to%20disk%20while%20locked.%20As%20you%20noted%2C%20the%20machine%20may%20be%20hibernated%2C%20or%20it%20may%20be%20running%20in%20a%20VM%20that%20gets%20snapshotted.%20%2DRaymond%5D) and macOS as well. \r\n\r\nTherefore, a user with a strong OS password and a strong wallet passphrase could still have their keys stolen if a thief takes their (hibernated) machine and reads the permanent storage.

But since this pr creates a new mutex, I see no conflict on grabbing it elsewhere, like here. Also I'm a little bit concerned that other calls to `CWallet::Lock` might unnecessarily lock this unrelated mutex, blocking execution.",

We already observe a failure in CI for this test. Since this is testing a race condition, the speed of the machine executing the test becomes a significant factor, and having sanitizers being run can cause the test to fail.\r\n\r\nI think we might be able to workaround this by using a batched RPC request as IIRC those are run in a single thread sequentially.",

      "body": "> Maybe the timeout can be increased to 999999?\r\n\r\nYes, the timeout before `sethdseed` can be increased to 999999, followed by running `walletlock`. I can open a follow-up PR for this.\r\n> Also I wonder why you picked a timeout of 3 below, or why walletpassphrase needs to be called at all twice in a row?\r\n\r\n3 was used because it needed to be a number that was large enough so that the scan would begin, but small enough so that the timeout would occur while the rescan is in progress. However, this number can be too large or too small depending on the speed of the machine.\r\n> If you want to confirm that the wallet can't be relocked while the rescan is in progress, wouldn't it be better to call walletlock rpc right after the rescan rpc?\r\n\r\nI don't completely understand this suggestion. Do you mean calling `walletlock` to ensure that the wallet is still unlocked? If so, I think there are two problems with that:\r\n\r\n- `walletlock` doesn't throw an error if the wallet is already locked\r\n- The wallet is supposed to re-lock immediately after the rescan, so the wallet might already be locked by the time `walletlock` is called, even if it did not lock during the rescan. However, using a batched RPC request might help with this.",
