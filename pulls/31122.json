    "body": "part of cluster mempool: #30289 \r\n\r\nIt became clear while working on cluster mempool that it would be helpful for transaction validation if we could consider a full set of proposed changes to the mempool -- consisting of a set of transactions to add, and a set of transactions (ie conflicts) to simultaneously remove -- and perform calculations on what the mempool would look like if the proposed changes were to be applied.  Two specific examples of where we'd like to do this:\r\n\r\n- Determining if ancestor/descendant/TRUC limits would be violated (in the future, cluster limits) if either a single transaction or a package of transactions were to be accepted\r\n- Determining if an RBF would make the mempool \"better\", however that idea is defined, both in the single transaction and package of transaction cases\r\n\r\nIn preparation for cluster mempool, I have pulled this reworking of the mempool interface out of #28676 so it can be reviewed on its own.  I have not re-implemented ancestor/descendant limits to be run through the changeset, since with cluster mempool those limits will be going away, so this seems like wasted effort.  However, I have rebased #28676 on top of this branch so reviewers can see what the new mempool interface could look like in the cluster mempool setting.\r\n\r\nThere are some minor behavior changes here, which I believe are inconsequential:\r\n- In the package validation setting, transactions would be added to the mempool before the `ConsensusScriptChecks()` are run. In theory, `ConsensusScriptChecks()` should always pass if the `PolicyScriptChecks()` have passed and it's just a belt-and-suspenders for us, but if somehow they were to diverge then there could be some small behavior change from adding transactions and then removing them, versus never adding them at all.\r\n- The error reporting on `CheckConflictTopology()` has slightly changed due to no longer distinguishing between direct conflicts and indirect conflicts. I believe this should be entirely inconsequential because there shouldn't be a logical difference between those two ideas from the perspective of this function, but I did have to update some error strings in some tests.\r\n- Because, in a package setting, RBFs now happen as part of the entire package being accepted, the logging has changed slightly because we do not know which transaction specifically evicted a given removed transaction. \r\n  -  Specifically, the \"package hash\" is now used to reference the set of transactions that are being accepted, rather than any single txid. The log message relating to package RBF that happen in the `TXPACKAGES` category has been updated as well to include the package hash, so that it's possible to see which specific set of transactions are being referenced by that package hash.\r\n  - Relatedly, the tracepoint logging in the package rbf case has been updated as well to reference the package hash, rather than a transaction hash.",

      "body": "Thanks @glozow and @ismaelsadeeq for the review; I've incorporated some of the comments.  If you have suggestions for how the logging can be improved in the package RBF case (and how the USDT tracing messages can be improved, similarly) please let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nAlso, I wanted to flag that the locking is a bit of a mess in this branch.  Initially, I tried to add lock annotations to the `CTxMemPoolChangeSet` functions to guarantee that the mempool itself was locked whenever any of those functions were invoked.  I had mixed results with the compiler understanding those annotations, and ran into a roadblock at some point with a unit test which was taking the mempool lock and should have satisfied the annotations, but the compiler wasn't recognizing the lock as being the same one that needed to be held.  I assume the complication is mostly that the changeset is a different object than the mempool, so one thing I could try is moving all the changeset methods to instead be methods of the mempool itself (which take a changeset as an argument, potentially) -- but that also seems like a little bit of a mess to me, so wasn't sure if that was worth doing.",

Similarly, in the last commit (\"tracing: pass if replaced by tx/pkg to tracepoint\", currently 0ca1e05d8bcbc42892156c15f128a5f829e9e48e) the `TRACE8` won't work and will need to be just `TRACEPOINT`.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Just rebased this on master -- @0xB10C thanks for the note on the tracepoint change.  @instagibbs I think I could rewrite the `CheckEphemeralSpends()` code to take advantage of the changesets for package validation (since we will now be maintaining a map of package transactions that we can query), but maybe that can be done in a separate PR?  Just left that code as-is for now.\r\n\r\n@naumenkogs Thanks for looking at the validation change relating to consensus-invalid packages.  Someone should probably test that logic by changing the policy checks to NOT be a strict superset of the consensus checks and verify that the logic I'm introducing here actually does what I think it does.  I intend to do that myself but haven't gotten to it yet. \r\n\r\nEDIT: I hacked up the validation logic to trigger this currently unreachable block of code -- ie to make the `ConsensusScriptChecks()` fail in a package validation context -- and verified that logic to remove the newly added transactions seems to work.  Would be great for others to verify this as well!",

Doesn't this allow to clear the victims mempool for free?\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, in case anyone has lost track: we're specifically talking about a codepath we believe is not possible to trigger, namely one where the `PolicyScriptChecks` pass yet the `ConsensusScriptChecks` fail for some transaction, and someone is able to submit such a transaction as part of a package to our node.\r\n\r\nIn this event, I actually don't think the mempool could be directly drained, because we don't call `LimitMempoolSize()` until after this condition is detected and the new transactions are removed.  However, I did observe that any RBF's that take place would not be fully reverted (ie the replaced transactions aren't being added back).\r\n\r\nIf it were simple to just re-add the just-removed transactions, I'd try to include that here as well, but it would take some additional work to topologically sort the removed transactions so they can be re-added.  Given that this logic is unreachable and already difficult-to-test as a result, I don't think it makes sense to add any significant complexity, at least for now -- this may be simpler to think about post-cluster-mempool.\r\n\r\n",

We could just as easily replace this with a `bool`; I made it a pointer mostly for debugging purposes, if the `Assume()` were ever hit.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the `unique_ptr` is that I wanted all the state in the ChangeSet to magically go away whenever the object goes out of scope, so that I didn't have to explicitly clean up state everywhere that a transaction might fail validation (which seems like a lot of places).  In this PR, there's not a ton of state, but I expect that when we implement cluster mempool that we'll be creating similar staging data structures within the `TxGraph` layer that will exist one level below the mempool (for computing clusters and feerate diagrams for candidate transactions), and I thought this mechanism of ending a staging when the changeset goes out of scope would be an easy way to manage things at that layer as well.  So in the future you could imagine that in the `CTxMemPoolChangeSet` constructor, we might initiate a staging in the underlying `TxGraph`; in the mempool `Apply()` function we might also apply the staging to the `TxGraph`; and in the `CTxMemPoolChangeSet` destructor we might abort a staging in the underlying `TxGraph`.\r\n\r\nThe paradigm I'm looking for is that you can have at most one changeset at a time, and when there's a changeset outstanding that serves as a lock on the mempool so that you can't otherwise add/remove things (except via the changeset) until the changes are either applied or aborted, and the changeset is the destroyed.  However if there's a better way to implement that than what I tried here, I'm certainly open to suggestions.",

For the package case, given that the `txpackages` log level is already reporting what transactions are in the package, does it make sense to duplicate that information in the `mempool` log category as well?\r\n\r\nAn issue that occurred to me with splitting up log messages for what's in a package across multiple lines is that other threads may be logging simultaneously and cause messages to be interleaved, making the resulting log difficult to parse.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to simply augment the existing `txpackages` log message to include the aggregate fee/size of the package, and reference the cumulative fee/size of the package that evicted a transaction.  Or we could be even more precise and use some kind of identifier for the package (perhaps BIP 331's \"Combined Hash\"?) in our logging. Now that I think about it, this may make the most sense: if we logged the combined hash in the `txpackages` log message, and referenced the combined hash in the replacement message, I think that would be pretty good.  And we could use the same combined in the tracepoints as well... Thoughts?\r\n",

Possibly it would be clearer to just not bother with the caching at all, but then we lose the optimization...  Thoughts?",

      "body": "@0xB10C Any thoughts on changing the way replacement logging works via tracepoints, in the package RBF case? One issue I can think of with what I'm proposing here is that the \"package hash\" we'd be sending is not one that would come through any other tracing messages -- would that be a problem?\r\n\r\nIf that is a problem, would it make sense to add a tracepoint that lines up with the existing `txpackages` debug log message, which (as of this PR) would now report the package hash along with the transaction ids that are in it?",

However, there's still an ugly special case in `Apply()` in that we can only used a cached ancestor set calculation for the first transaction in a package (because the calculation is no longer correct once transactions start getting added to the mempool).\r\n\r\nNote that in the cluster mempool implementation, this ugliness in `Apply()` goes away, because we will no longer need to have ancestor sets calculated in order to add a transaction to the mempool.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I believe that we may be able to completely eliminate the need for this function altogether, post-cluster-mempool.  I should go back and try to rework #28676 to demonstrate that this is the case, but my recollection is that the only reason we will need to calculate ancestors sets in the future is for an RBF sanity check (namely that we're not replacing an ancestor of any to-be-added transaction) which we can reimplement without these ancestor calculations.",

I agree that a \"package hash\" on it's own might not be useful for someone interested in \"which transactions were replaced by which other transactions\". On the other hand, the tracepoints are on purpose only semi-stable as they expose internals. If the internals change, the tracepoints need to change too.\r\n\r\n > which (as of this PR) would now report the package hash along with the transaction ids that are in it?\r\n\r\nThat could be useful, yes. However, constructing and passing arrays/lists to tracepoints is probably not something we want / can  do (at least not without https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26593).\r\n\r\nOne solution could be to update the current tracepoint to a `TRACE8` and have a bool argument indicating if `tx_or_package_hash` is a tx or package hash with `m_subpackage.m_changeset->GetTxCount() == 1`. This wouldn't allow to get data on \"which transactions were replaced by which other transactions\", but consumers would know that the hash is either referring to a tx or package. While I'm currently using the tracepoint to monitor count, size and fees in replacements, I don't use the txids at the moment. I used them a while ago for [fullrbf.mempool.observer](https://web.archive.org/web/20230213002456/https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/). \r\n\r\nalso, CC @virtu who initially worked on these tracepoints. Maybe you have another idea.",

Also, I agree with your assessment after re-reading the code some more.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be nice if the SubPackageState were clearly destroyed when it goes out of scope from logic that uses it...  Even though it's seemingly not necessary to call cleanup here, it makes me a little uncomfortable to leave the code in a place where it takes some investigation to figure out that the changeset will be gone by the time LimitMempoolSize() is called.\r\n\r\nI might just add a comment mentioning that this should have gotten cleaned up by `AcceptSubPackage()` but that I'm leaving the cleanup call for readability, given that the call to `LimitMempoolSize` requires that the changeset be gone.  Does that seem reasonable?",
