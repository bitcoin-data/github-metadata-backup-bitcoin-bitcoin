    "body": "part of cluster mempool: #30289 \r\n\r\nIt became clear while working on cluster mempool that it would be helpful for transaction validation if we could consider a full set of proposed changes to the mempool -- consisting of a set of transactions to add, and a set of transactions (ie conflicts) to simultaneously remove -- and perform calculations on what the mempool would look like if the proposed changes were to be applied.  Two specific examples of where we'd like to do this:\r\n\r\n- Determining if ancestor/descendant/TRUC limits would be violated (in the future, cluster limits) if either a single transaction or a package of transactions were to be accepted\r\n- Determining if an RBF would make the mempool \"better\", however that idea is defined, both in the single transaction and package of transaction cases\r\n\r\nIn preparation for cluster mempool, I have pulled this reworking of the mempool interface out of #28676 so it can be reviewed on its own.  I have not re-implemented ancestor/descendant limits to be run through the changeset, since with cluster mempool those limits will be going away, so this seems like wasted effort.  However, I have rebased #28676 on top of this branch so reviewers can see what the new mempool interface could look like in the cluster mempool setting.\r\n\r\nThere are some minor behavior changes here, which I believe are inconsequential:\r\n- In the package validation setting, transactions would be added to the mempool before the `ConsensusScriptChecks()` are run. In theory, `ConsensusScriptChecks()` should always pass if the `PolicyScriptChecks()` have passed and it's just a belt-and-suspenders for us, but if somehow they were to diverge then there could be some small behavior change from adding transactions and then removing them, versus never adding them at all.\r\n- The error reporting on `CheckConflictTopology()` has slightly changed due to no longer distinguishing between direct conflicts and indirect conflicts. I believe this should be entirely inconsequential because there shouldn't be a logical difference between those two ideas from the perspective of this function, but I did have to update some error strings in some tests.\r\n- Because, in a package setting, RBFs now happen as part of the entire package being accepted, the logging has changed slightly because we do not know which transaction specifically evicted a given removed transaction.",

If you have suggestions for how the logging can be improved in the package RBF case (and how the USDT tracing messages can be improved, similarly) please let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nAlso, I wanted to flag that the locking is a bit of a mess in this branch.  Initially, I tried to add lock annotations to the `CTxMemPoolChangeSet` functions to guarantee that the mempool itself was locked whenever any of those functions were invoked.  I had mixed results with the compiler understanding those annotations, and ran into a roadblock at some point with a unit test which was taking the mempool lock and should have satisfied the annotations, but the compiler wasn't recognizing the lock as being the same one that needed to be held.  I assume the complication is mostly that the changeset is a different object than the mempool, so one thing I could try is moving all the changeset methods to instead be methods of the mempool itself (which take a changeset as an argument, potentially) -- but that also seems like a little bit of a mess to me, so wasn't sure if that was worth doing.",

      "body": "This only exists for sanity checking that we don't have more than one changeset at a time.  We could just as easily replace this with a `bool`; I made it a pointer mostly for debugging purposes, if the `Assume()` were ever hit.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the `unique_ptr` is that I wanted all the state in the ChangeSet to magically go away whenever the object goes out of scope, so that I didn't have to explicitly clean up state everywhere that a transaction might fail validation (which seems like a lot of places).  In this PR, there's not a ton of state, but I expect that when we implement cluster mempool that we'll be creating similar staging data structures within the `TxGraph` layer that will exist one level below the mempool (for computing clusters and feerate diagrams for candidate transactions), and I thought this mechanism of ending a staging when the changeset goes out of scope would be an easy way to manage things at that layer as well.  So in the future you could imagine that in the `CTxMemPoolChangeSet` constructor, we might initiate a staging in the underlying `TxGraph`; in the mempool `Apply()` function we might also apply the staging to the `TxGraph`; and in the `CTxMemPoolChangeSet` destructor we might abort a staging in the underlying `TxGraph`.\r\n\r\nThe paradigm I'm looking for is that you can have at most one changeset at a time, and when there's a changeset outstanding that serves as a lock on the mempool so that you can't otherwise add/remove things (except via the changeset) until the changes are either applied or aborted, and the changeset is the destroyed.  However if there's a better way to implement that than what I tried here, I'm certainly open to suggestions.",
