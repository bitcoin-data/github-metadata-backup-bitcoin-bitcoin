    "body": "Add an RPC to get prioritised transactions (also tells you whether the tx is in mempool or not), helping users clean up `mapDeltas` manually. When `CTxMemPool::PrioritiseTransaction` sets a delta to 0, remove the entry from `mapDeltas`.\r\n\r\nMotivation / Background\r\n- `mapDeltas` entries are never removed from mapDeltas except when the tx is mined in a block or conflicted.\r\n\t- Mostly it is a feature to allow `prioritisetransaction` for a tx that isn't in the mempool {yet, anymore}. A user can may resbumit a tx and it retains its priority, or mark a tx as \"definitely accept\" before it is seen.\r\n\t- Since #8448, `mapDeltas` is persisted to mempool.dat and loaded on restart. This is also good, otherwise we lose prioritisation on restart.\r\n\t- Note the removal due to block/conflict is only done when `removeForBlock` is called, i.e. when the block is received. If you load a mempool.dat containing `mapDeltas` with transactions that were mined already (e.g. the file was saved prior to the last few blocks), you don't delete them.\r\n\t- Related: #4818 and #6464.\r\n- There is no way to query the node for not-in-mempool `mapDeltas`. If you add a priority and forget what the value was, the only way to get that information is to inspect mempool.dat.\r\n- Calling `prioritisetransaction` with an inverse value does not remove it from `mapDeltas`, it just sets the value to 0. It disappears on a restart (`LoadMempool` checks if delta is 0), but that might not happen for a while.\r\n\r\nAdded together, if a user calls `prioritisetransaction` very regularly and not all those transactions get mined/conflicted, `mapDeltas` might keep lots of entries of delta=0 around. A user should clean up the not-in-mempool prioritisations, but that's currently difficult without keeping track of what those txids/amounts are.",

Probably miners would be thankful to not need multiply the result by 100000000 first in order to delete mapDelta entries (and it would also make the tests simpler :sweat_smile:), but happy to ACK either variant.\r\n\r\nLeft a few small nits below.",

Rather than make judgment calls on what error is important(which is currently just return the \"first\"!), we simply return all errors and let the callers determine what's best.\r\n\r\nAdded a top level `package_msg` for quick eye-balling of general success of the package.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a couple bugs:\r\n\r\n1) Currently we don't actually broadcast a transaction, even if it was entered into our mempool, if a subsequent transaction causes `PKG_TX` failure. (I have a test for another branch that catches this, will adapt if concept ACK)\r\n2) \"other-wtxid\" is uncovered by tests, but IIUC was previously required to return \"fees\" and \"vsize\" results, but did not. I just make those results optional.",
