    "body": "Split out of #28674\r\n\r\nNote that we can't yet drop our configure checks because we pass the results on to minisketch. I've opened a PR for that upstream here: https://github.com/sipa/minisketch/pull/80\r\n\r\nfanquake [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28674#discussion_r1422215535) that we simply replace our `CountBits` call-sites with uses of `std::bit_width` directly and just drop the tests and fuzzers. I agree with that, but I wanted to allow our tests/fuzzers to run with this change first to help convince reviewers that `std::bit_width` is a drop-in replacement for`CountBits`.\r\n\r\nI can either add a commit on top of this PR to do the switch after the c-i has run or do it as a follow-up PR, I have no preference.\r\n\r\nI was curious to see what would happen under the hood with this change. Fortunately libc++ (as an example) does exactly what one would expect, using the built-ins: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/__bit/countl.h#L56 ",
