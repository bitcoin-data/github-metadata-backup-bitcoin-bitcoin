Receiving duplicate transactions on `mainnet` happens quite regularly. I then reproduced the issue on `regtest`.\r\n\r\nSince discovering the issue on `mainnet` I've \"rediscovered\" it 1.) using static analysis tooling (Coverity is one example), 2.) by running the ordinary functional tests under MemorySanitizer, and 3.) by running the ordinary functional tests under Valgrind.\r\n\r\nMy personal view is that we really really underuse the excellent modern tooling that is typically used in security critical C++ projects to guard against introduction of bugs like this. I find that a bit surprising and I promise to do my best to help improve that situation going forward :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Rediscovery 1.
