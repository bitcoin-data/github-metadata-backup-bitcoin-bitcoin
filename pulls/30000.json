    "body": "Part of #27463 in the \"make orphan handling more robust\" section.\r\n\r\nCurrently the main map in `TxOrphanage` is indexed by txid; we do not allow 2 transactions with the same txid into TxOrphanage. This means that if we receive a transaction and want to store it in orphanage, we'll fail to do so if a same-txid-different-witness version of the tx already exists in the orphanage. The existing orphanage entry can stay until it expires 20 minutes later, or until we find that it is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis means an attacker can try to block/delay us accepting an orphan transaction by sending a mutated version of the child ahead of time. See included test.\r\n\r\nPrior to #28970, we don't rely on the orphanage for anything and it would be relatively difficult to guess what transaction will go to a node's orphanage. After the parent(s) are accepted, if anybody sends us the correct transaction, we'll end up accepting it. However, this is a bit more painful for 1p1c: it's easier for an attacker to tell when a tx is going to hit a node's orphanage, and we need to store the correct orphan + receive the parent before we'll consider the package. If we start out with a bad orphan, we can't evict it until we receive the parent + try the 1p1c, and then we'll need to download the real child, put it in orphanage, download the parent again, and then retry 1p1c.",

See #27463 for project tracking and #28031 for how this code is used.\r\n\r\nSeparating this PR was suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28031#discussion_r1261414179.\r\n\r\nChanges here:\r\n- Change params to wtxid instead of txid.\r\n- Track total size (`CTransaction::GetTotalSize()` of orphans stored, as well as the size per peer.\r\n- Support having multiple announcers for the same tx. This helps us retry resolving the same orphan with multiple peers if it fails the first time.\r\n- Store the deduplicated missing parent txids in `OrphanTx` so that we don't need to calculate them again later on.\r\n- Return the erased wtxids from `EraseForBlock` which includes orphans that conflicted with the block. This helps us delete those orphan resolution attempts from our tracker.\r\n- Enable limiting the total size of orphans instead of just the total count. No new limits are introduced, the default is maximum count * maximum tx size.\r\n- Unit tests + fuzzer.",

This was not previously possible because we where only checking against `txid` that does not include the `[witness]` section of a transaction as defined in [BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#transaction-id). \r\n\r\nThis change needs to be implemented only for the orphanage and not the rest of the structures that `AlreadyHaveTx()` checks against, since `txid` might be relevant there. The new behavior is implicitly documented in the `bool TxOrphanage::HaveTx(const Wtxid& wtxid) const` function definition which now takes `wtxid` as its single argument. ",

The tests may help with that - also added one for invs that helps illustrate what the cases are, and added unit tests.\r\n\r\nI thought a bit about whether we should check for same-txid-different-witness but from the same peer and replace that in orphanage. Given that a Bitcoin Core node doesn't ever do witness replacement, this seems like unnecessary complexity that won't ever get used between normally-operating nodes. So I did not add this.",

But yeah totally fair to say it's difficult to review it together, so I'll split the first commit to make it more explicit where the change is happening and why that's ok.\r\n\r\n>  I think it could be a better approach to update AlreadyHaveTx to take a Wtxid\r\n\r\nfwiw I disagree, as we do want to check txids in the other data structures.\r\n\r\n> coinbase transactions are [required to have all 0 Wtxids](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#commitment-structure) (0x0000....0000) which means for an INV message for a witness coinbase you have to use the non-witness txid to reference the transaction? - so AlreadyHaveTx in that case is explicitly not using a Wtxid? (Or are coinbases never INV'd?)\r\n\r\nThat link is referring to the wtxid of the coinbase transaction when calculating the witness commitment; that's not the case in any other situation. Also, yes, if we get a coinbase transaction in tx relay we'd drop that pretty much immediately and wouldn't be putting it in orphanage:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9d1a286f20b8a602ffe72928bcd79be09fdbf9d0/src/validation.cpp#L735-L742",

      "body": "> The argument I'm making in this PR is that in all the places we are checking by txid, we shouldn't be doing that, because we're missing same-txid-different-witness cases.\r\n\r\nI agree, the rationale makes sense. My concern is about segwit txs (`txid != wtxid`) where we check by txid (for whatever reason: intentional because we don't have witness data, legacy and we never updated it, buggy, ...): just creating a wtxid from the txid hash as is done here seems like it has potential to start missing things we previously wouldn't - since `TxOrphanage` now _only_ indexes by `wtxid`?\r\n\r\nI've made a [branch](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/compare/2024-04-orphan-use-wtxid...stickies-v:bitcoin:pr/30000) where I've created 2 overloads of `AlreadyHaveTx`: one that takes `Wtxid` and one that takes `Txid`, to force all the conversions to the edges. I implemented the `Txid` to perform less checks, based on the documentation (didn't verify the code) that `m_recent_rejects_reconsiderable` and `m_recent_rejects` uses `wtxid`, whereas `m_recent_confirmed_transactions` uses both `txid` and `wtxid`.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 callsites of `AlreadyHaveTx`. For 2 of them, [1) here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/compare/2024-04-orphan-use-wtxid...stickies-v:bitcoin:pr/30000#diff-6875de769e90cec84d2e8a9c1b962cdbcda44d870d42e4215827e599e11e90e3R4255-R4256) and [2) here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/compare/2024-04-orphan-use-wtxid...stickies-v:bitcoin:pr/30000#diff-6875de769e90cec84d2e8a9c1b962cdbcda44d870d42e4215827e599e11e90e3R4561), the conversion seems trivial/sensible.\r\n\r\nA third is more confusing to me. [3) Here in `ProcessMessage`](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/compare/2024-04-orphan-use-wtxid...stickies-v:bitcoin:pr/30000#diff-6875de769e90cec84d2e8a9c1b962cdbcda44d870d42e4215827e599e11e90e3R4663), I initially used the `Txid` overload, but that fails the `p2p_orphan_handling.py::test_orphan_of_orphan` test. Switching to `Wtxid` makes it pass, but I don't understand why. Since with this pull, `TxOrphanage` indexes on `Wtxid`, calling `HaveTx` on a blind conversion of `parent_txid` into a `Wtxid` seems like it shouldn't find anything in the orphanage, unless we're dealing with non-segwit transaction?\r\n\r\nFinally, for the [4) fourth here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/compare/2024-04-orphan-use-wtxid...stickies-v:bitcoin:pr/30000#diff-6875de769e90cec84d2e8a9c1b962cdbcda44d870d42e4215827e599e11e90e3R6319-R6341), I think my refactoring is a no-op, we just blindly call the different function signatures based on `GenTxid::IsWtxid()`, no real difference with the current implementation except perhaps for making things more explicit.",
