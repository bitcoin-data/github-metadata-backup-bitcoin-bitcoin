Also it makes the individual script parts more readable.\r\n",

I am rebasing this PR every day and the travis build works splendidly every time (except for this one time where everything in travis failed as it did not at all have any network connectivity).\r\n\r\nBecause I do not see what more I could do (as a reviewer) but look at travis whether it worked or not. Possibly I could imagine forking and pushing it in my own github-space and looking at travis for my repo, seeing if I can make it fail in the way it should fail (again, as a reviewer; obviously I did that but I'm the author).\r\n\r\nI'm mostly asking out of curiosity.",
