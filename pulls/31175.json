    "body": "With the introduction of a mining ipc interface and the potential future introduction of a kernel library API it becomes increasingly important to offer common behaviour between them. An example of this is ProcessNewBlock, which is used by ipc, rpc, net_processing and (potentially) the kernel library. Having divergent behaviour on suggested pre-checks and checks for these functions is confusing to both developers and users and is a maintenance burden.\r\n\r\nThe rpc interface for ProcessNewBlock (submitblock) currently pre-checks if the block has a coinbase transaction and whether it has been processed before. While the current example binary for how to use the kernel library, bitcoin-chainstate, imitates these checks, the other interfaces do not.\r\n\r\nThe coinbase check is repeated again early during ProcessNewBlock. Pre-checking it may also shadow more fundamental problems with a block. In most cases the block header is checked first, before validating the transactions. Checking the coinbase first therefore masks potential issues with the header. Fix this by removing the pre-check.\r\n\r\nSimilary the duplicate checks are repeated early in the contextual checks of ProcessNewBlock. If duplicate blocks are detected much of their validation is skipped. Depending on the constitution of the block, validating the merkle root of the block is part of the more intensive workload when validating a block. This could be an argument for moving the pre-checks into block processing. In net_processing this would have a smaller effect however, since the block mutation check, which also validates the merkle root, is done before.\r\n\r\nTesting spamming a node with valid, but duplicate unrequested blocks seems to exhaust a CPU thread, but does not seem to significantly impact keeping up with the tip. The benefits of adding these checks to net_processing are questionable, especially since there are other ways to trigger the more CPU-intensive checks without submitting a duplicate block. Since these DOS concerns apply even less to the RPC interface, which does not have banning mechanics built in, remove them too.\r\n\r\nFinally, also remove the pre-checks from `bitcoin-chainstate.cpp`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).",

      "body": "Concept ACK\r\n\r\nI agree with the general motivation. While this PR can change the error message of `submitblock` in case more than one thing is wrong with the block, I don't really see why one is more important than the other.\r\n\r\n> UpdateUncommittedBlockStructures -> GetWitnessCommitmentIndex which would result in UB, before any PoW checks are made.\r\n\r\nNice find!\r\nI think that it would be good to have a test that would trigger the UB if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ada0caa165905b50db351a56ec124518c922085a was reverted (it requires us to know the header so that `UpdateUncommittedBlockStructures()` gets called, so the added test for an empty block doesn't trigger it - could make another `deepcopy` of `block` instead and then delete the txns):\r\n\r\n> Fix this by removing the pre-check, but still throwing the same more expressive exception in case a coinbase validation error occurs.\r\n\r\nI realize that you want to keep the existing behavior in this PR, but I do wonder if it really makes sense to have other consensus errors return \"rejected\", and this particular one to throw an exception.",

It now always returns the fundamental\r\n  reason for rejecting an invalid block and only returns \"duplicate\" for\r\n  valid blocks it has already accepted.\r\n```\r\n\r\nStrangely however `mining_basic.py` has two checks for `duplicate-invalid`. Those were introduced were introduced in the same v0.18 release: commit fa6ab8ada14dd265e224496440ab0b5d99dfd0ef of #13983.\r\n\r\n_Update_: the real behaviour seems to be that we give the real reason for early checks, but return `duplicate-invalid` if later checks failed previously. The change in df7ad9223025b5d75e27813ce3b89ef6fc431805 seems compatible with that.",

I feel like with this kind of change I would err on the conservative side and not introduce potentially breaking behaviour. Even if this might be a nice way to inject block data into the node, I don't know if this is something anybody needs, even if it now more closely mimics `getblockfrompeer`. \r\n\r\nWe could keep the duplicate check and remove the invalid duplicate check, but I feel like requiring a pre-check to handle the pruning and force processing case is not very elegant. At the same time we can't move the check into `ProcessNewBlock`, since it would break `getblockfrompeer` as far as I can tell. What do you think?\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-chainstate` currently does not support pruning (though it also sets force processing), so removing it there should not have the same effect.",

The only thing that matters for `getblockfrompeer` is that it _can_ store previously pruned blocks.\r\n\r\nThat said, I do think it's useful to allow `submitblock` to store a previously pruned block. It lets a user dump the block on one node and submit it on this node, without having go through the effort of establishing a p2p connection, figuring out the peer id and then calling `getblockfrompeer`.

Or they were worried that since mining pools use this RPC internally (see e.g. #3658, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/5538#issuecomment-68075858) they might have it exposed to the internet - or at least blindly forward \"blocks\" to it.

      "body": "I do not have the context nor the bug report behind this fix, but #10146 is clearly preventing a crash on accessing `block->vtx[0]` when an empty block is submitted through `submitblock`. In addition the introduction of the check for a valid coinbase transaction smells like preventing https://gnusha.org/url/?https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-February/016697.html but i can't think of how it could be exploited.\r\n\r\nTypically you would think of an attack along these lines:\r\n1. Miner A is exposing `submitblock`.\r\n2. Miner B mines a valid block and a malleated, invalid, block with the same hash.\r\n3. Miner B sends the malleated block to Miner A's `submitblock` API, which stores it as invalid.\r\n4. Miner A broadcasts his valid block.\r\n5. Miner B rejects it. REKT.\r\n\r\nBut `submitblock` uses `ProcessNewBlock` to store the block. And #10146 is after https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9765, which makes sure `CheckBlock` is called (and therefore the coinbase check performed) before persisting the header.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell was there more to #10146 than the crash fix?",
