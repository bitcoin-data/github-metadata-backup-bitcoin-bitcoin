    "body": "With the introduction of a mining ipc interface and the potential future introduction of a kernel library API it becomes increasingly important to offer common behaviour between them. An example of this is ProcessNewBlock, which is used by ipc, rpc, net_processing and (potentially) the kernel library. Having divergent behaviour on suggested pre-checks and checks for these functions is confusing to both developers and users and is a maintenance burden.\r\n\r\nThe rpc interface for ProcessNewBlock (submitblock) currently pre-checks if the block has a coinbase transaction and whether it has been processed before. While the current example binary for how to use the kernel library, bitcoin-chainstate, imitates these checks, the other interfaces do not.\r\n\r\nThe coinbase check is repeated again early during ProcessNewBlock. Pre-checking it may also shadow more fundamental problems with a block. In most cases the block header is checked first, before validating the transactions. Checking the coinbase first therefore masks potential issues with the header. Fix this by removing the pre-check.\r\n\r\nSimilary the duplicate checks are repeated early in the contextual checks of ProcessNewBlock. If duplicate blocks are detected much of their validation is skipped. Depending on the constitution of the block, validating the merkle root of the block is part of the more intensive workload when validating a block. This could be an argument for moving the pre-checks into block processing. In net_processing this would have a smaller effect however, since the block mutation check, which also validates the merkle root, is done before.\r\n\r\nTesting spamming a node with valid, but duplicate unrequested blocks seems to exhaust a CPU thread, but does not seem to significantly impact keeping up with the tip. The benefits of adding these checks to net_processing are questionable, especially since there are other ways to trigger the more CPU-intensive checks without submitting a duplicate block. Since these DOS concerns apply even less to the RPC interface, which does not have banning mechanics built in, remove them too.\r\n\r\nFinally, also remove the pre-checks from `bitcoin-chainstate.cpp`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).",

      "body": "Concept ACK\r\n\r\nI agree with the general motivation. While this PR can change the error message of `submitblock` in case more than one thing is wrong with the block, I don't really see why one is more important than the other.\r\n\r\n> UpdateUncommittedBlockStructures -> GetWitnessCommitmentIndex which would result in UB, before any PoW checks are made.\r\n\r\nNice find!\r\nI think that it would be good to have a test that would trigger the UB if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ada0caa165905b50db351a56ec124518c922085a was reverted (it requires us to know the header so that `UpdateUncommittedBlockStructures()` gets called, so the added test for an empty block doesn't trigger it - could make another `deepcopy` of `block` instead and then delete the txns):\r\n\r\n> Fix this by removing the pre-check, but still throwing the same more expressive exception in case a coinbase validation error occurs.\r\n\r\nI realize that you want to keep the existing behavior in this PR, but I do wonder if it really makes sense to have other consensus errors return \"rejected\", and this particular one to throw an exception.",
