    "body": "During IBD, there is the following stalling mechanism if we can't proceed with assigning blocks from a 1024 lookahead window because all of these blocks are either already downloaded or in-flight: We'll mark the peer from which we expect the current block that would allow us to advance our tip (and thereby move the 1024 window ahead) as a possible staller. We then give this peer 2 more seconds to deliver a block (`BLOCK_STALLING_TIMEOUT`) and if it doesn't, disconnect it and assign the critical block we need to another peer. \r\n\r\nNow the problem is that this second peer is immediately marked as a potential staller using the same mechanism and given 2 seconds as well - if our own connection is so slow that it simply takes us more than 2 seconds to download this block, that peer will also be disconnected (and so on...), leading to repeated disconnections and no progress in IBD. This has been described in #9213, and I have observed this when doing IBD  on slower connections or with Tor - sometimes there would be several minutes without progress, where all we did was disconnect peers and find new ones.\r\n\r\nThe `2s` stalling timeout was introduced in #4468, when blocks weren't full and before Segwit increased the maximum possible physical size of blocks - so I think it made a lot of sense back then.\r\nBut it would be good to revisit this timeout now. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes the timout adaptive (idea by sipa):\r\nIf we disconnect a peer for stalling, we now double the timeout for the next peer (up to a maximum of 64s). If we connect a block, we half it again up to the old value of 2 seconds. That way, peers that are comparatively slower will still get disconnected, but long phases of disconnecting all peers shouldn't happen anymore.\r\n\r\nFixes #9213",

This seems a fine improvement.\r\n\r\nI think one way of looking at stalling is that it happens when one peer's bandwidth is less than 1/64th of the total bandwidth (64 = 1024/16 = window/max in transit) [0]. \r\n\r\nI think that means there might be a clever way of preventing slow nodes from stalling the download by reducing the in transit limit instead -- so that instead of supplying 16 blocks in the time it takes the other peers to supply 1008 to avoid stalling, the peer only needs to supply 8 or 4 blocks in the time it takes the other peers to supply 1016 or 1020. [1]\r\n\r\nI think adding the blocks only nodes probably made this slightly worse, since there are now 2 extra peers, so now you need something like 25% more bandwidth in order to still have 1/64th of the total...\r\n\r\n[0] Measured in blocks of course, so even if your bandwidth in bytes is fine, you might be unlucky to be asked for 16 blocks that are 2MB each, while everyone else is just being asked for 1008 50kB blocks at you (32MB total vs 7.2MB per peer).\r\n\r\n[1] Perhaps you could implement this by keeping a global and per-peer exponential rolling average of how many blocks you download per second; then you could set the peer's in-transit limit to `1024 * peer_avg / global_avg`; capping it at 16, and marking the peer as stalling and disconnecting if that value drops below 2 (in which case the remaining peers *each* have 50x this peer's bandwidth)?",

      "body": "> I think that means there might be a clever way of preventing slow nodes from stalling the download by reducing the in transit limit instead -- so that instead of supplying 16 blocks in the time it takes the other peers to supply 1008 to avoid stalling, the peer only needs to supply 8 or 4 blocks in the time it takes the other peers to supply 1016 or 1020. [1]\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a very interesting alternative approach. I'm not sure I understand it completely though: Are you suggesting to assign slower peers less blocks simultaneously, to help prevent stalling situations from occurring in the first place? And also move away from the concept that a stalling situation occurs only when we can't move the 1024 block window forward, but make it dependent on the other peers instead, so that we'd possibly disconnect slow peers much earlier than that if they are slower in comparison to faster ones?\r\n",

I think you need to keep the 1024 block window (since increasing that hurts pruning), and I think that if the window gets full you should still call that \"stalling\".\r\n\r\nBut I think if you change the `MAX_BLOCKS_IN_TRANSIT_PER_PEER` so that slower peers have fewer in-transit blocks, then you'll be stalling much less often, and may not need to disconnect them at all -- that lets you stay connected to tor peers during IBD (for partition/sybil resistance) even if your ipv4/ipv6 peers are *much* faster. Maybe you could disconnect them when their `max_blocks_in_transit` drops to 1 or 2, before they actually cause stalling?\r\n\r\nMaybe a more specific example would be worthwhile. As it stands, if your first peer will give you one block every 5 seconds, and your other 9 peers will collectively give you 14 blocks every second (on average, 7.8 times faster than the first peer, in total 70 times faster), then by the time that first peer has downloaded blocks 1..15 (which takes 75 seconds), the other peers will have given you blocks 17..1039 after 73.1 seconds, and stalling gets triggered. But if the slow peer had only queued up 8 blocks, then it would have supplied them in 40 seconds, which only gives the other peers enough time to supply 560 blocks, so they won't fill up the window. Hmm, I guess it ought to be possible to simulate that scenario via the functional test's `P2PInterface` stuff...",

      "body": "> The test takes 1m45s on my laptop\r\n\r\nThat was when compiled with TSAN. Normal debug build takes only about 30 seconds. It still fails. There are some problems with the test:\r\n\r\n* First test (should not stall):\r\nthose `received: block...` messages in the log above (from the failure of the second test) are produced from the first test. The `sleep(0.5)` was apparently not enough, so I _fixed_ it to `sleep(5)` (just for testing, not to actually have it in the final test). This means that in practice it could stall and remain undetected by the first test because it will be happy to not see `Stall started` in the log even though it may be printed shortly after the first test has eagerly declared success. We want to check that there are 1023 `received: block` messages in the log and that afterwards the stalling logic from `SendMessages()` is executed and after that there is no \"Stall started\" in the log. I am not sure how to do that. Checking the bytes received for block messages seems to be better than the sleep, but could still end the wait too early.\r\n\r\n* Second test (should stall):\r\nit fails because there is no \"Stall started peer=0\" message. I added `sleep(10)` at the end of the `with...` block to wait even more for the stall. Then it fails with this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAssertionError: [node 0] Expected messages \"['Stall started peer=0']\" does not partially match log:\r\n\r\n - 2022-10-20T12:16:52.334202Z [net_processing.cpp:2806] [ProcessMessage] [net] received: headers (83028 bytes) peer=1\r\n - 2022-10-20T12:16:55.712397Z [validation.cpp:3686] [ProcessNewBlockHeaders] Synchronizing blockheaders, height: 1025 (~0.17%)\r\n - 2022-10-20T12:16:55.712923Z [net_processing.cpp:2806] [ProcessMessage] [net] received: headers (83028 bytes) peer=8\r\n - 2022-10-20T12:16:59.078114Z [net_processing.cpp:5328] [SendMessages] [net] Stall started peer=1\r\n - 2022-10-20T12:16:59.078214Z [net_processing.cpp:2806] [ProcessMessage] [net] received: headers (83028 bytes) peer=4\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a `Stall started peer=1` message but it comes 7 seconds after `received: headers` and is for a different peer.

The `sleep(0.5)` was apparently not enough, so I _fixed_ it to `sleep(5)` (just for testing, not to actually have it in the final test). This means that in practice it could stall and remain undetected by the first test because it will be happy to not see `Stall started` in the log even though it may be printed shortly after the first test has eagerly declared success. We want to check that there are 1023 `received: block` messages in the log and that afterwards the stalling logic from `SendMessages()` is executed and after that there is no \"Stall started\" in the log. I am not sure how to do that. Checking the bytes received for block messages seems to be better than the sleep, but could still end the wait too early.\r\n\r\nI rewrote the test such that it doesn't use the log anymore, but waits until all blocks are received, syncs (so that a peer could get mark as a staller), waits for 3s, syncs again (so that a peer could get disconnected), and then checks that no peer gets disconnected.\r\n\r\n> * Second test (should stall):\r\n>   it fails because there is no \"Stall started peer=0\" message. I added `sleep(10)` at the end of the `with...` block to wait even more for the stall. Then it fails with this error:\r\n\r\nI removed the `peer=0` part of the check and added a missing `self.all_sync_send_with_ping(peers)` to the `with` block. With that, the tests succeeds for me even with some slow sanitizers enabled - will do more runs over the weekend to check for intermittent failures.\r\n\r\n> I am ok to drop the test.

However, the stalling logic was completely untested before, which is not ideal, so the test doesn't just cover the changes from this PR. \r\n@dergoegge do you have an opinion, since you suggested the test? Do you think that the stalling logic could maybe better be covered by a unit test after #25515? (which would have less problems with timeouts).",

(Idea by Pieter Wuille)\n\nThis makes situations more unlikely in which we'd keep on\ndisconnecting many of our peers for stalling, even though our\nown bandwidth is insufficient to download a block in 2 seconds.\n\nCo-authored-by: Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>",

So we'd need some data structure to keep track of download times for not-yet-connected blocks and add/remove entries from it during IBD.\r\n\r\nIf we did this, it would help us cycle through less peers in situations where we assign multiple blocks to a peer and halving the timeout after successfully downloading a block would lead to a stalling situation again - but note that there are also other sources of disconnections that could be improved if we kept track of this kind data during IBD: E.g. if doubling the timeout is not sufficient and we'd need to 4x or 8x it.\r\n\r\nSo if we want something better but more complicated (with bookkeeping), my feeling is that we should go for another approach altogether, like basing the stalling timeout on a running average over the last received block times from multiple peers instead of a doubling/halving approach.\r\n",

The window will likely move many times between would-be stalls, even when the stalling timeout has adapted to be close to the \"correct\" value.\r\n\r\nWe should aim to be in a position where the stalling timeout is sort of in an equilibrium between triggering occasionally but not all the time. I think the best way to achieve that is to:\r\n* Increase it when it triggers due to being too low (reducing the probability of triggering in the future) [implemented]\r\n* Decrease it when it didn't trigger *due to being high enough*. And I think we have a way of measuring that: when the stalling detection triggers, and the stalling timer starts, but then the timeout is not reached. And by seeing how long it actually took for before the stalling state is resolved we can even do better than just applying a % drop; e.g. we could set the new timeout to (old_timeout + actual_time_used) / 2.\r\n",

      "body": "> From my perspective, this PR seems to be strictly an improvement even if the stalling timeout backs off too aggressively.\r\n\r\nI'd say that with its current approach, the PR improves behavior in isolated stalling situations where there are currently repeated disconnections of many/all of our peers without making any progress in getting blocks - but a previous stalling situation will not affect the behavior in future stalling situations because all memory of the previous stalling incident will be lost after a few blocks:\r\n\r\n@sipa's suggestion would introduce a long-lasting memory of previous stalling situations\r\n- I think that one downside of this approach is that the moving window algorithm should only lead to a stalling situation if one peer is significantly slower than the rest of the peers. We'd want to replace this first peer usually - giving it more time based on previous stalling situations is probably not beneficial, because if it was comparably fast to other peers, this would not have led to this peer being marked as a staller in the first place.\r\n- The upside is in situations where the actual time to download a block for us is significantly larger than 2 seconds - we'd churn through multiple peers / timeout doublings again in every stalling situation right now until we reach the \"correct\" timeout, but wouldn't anymore with a longer memory.\r\n\r\n> * Decrease it when it didn't trigger _due to being high enough_. And I think we have a way of measuring that: when the stalling detection triggers, and the stalling timer starts, but then the timeout is not reached. And by seeing how long it actually took for before the stalling state is resolved we can even do better than just applying a % drop; e.g. we could set the new timeout to (old_timeout + actual_time_used) / 2.\r\n\r\nI think this would mean moving to the decrease of the stalling timeout to `ProcessMessages` (`NetMsgType::BLOCK`) where `m_stalling_since` is currently reset back to 0. At this point we haven't validated the block yet or connected it to the chain, wo we'd likely would need to at least make sure that we only decrease it after receiving the actual block that allows us to extend our chain (the peer might also have been sending us another block).",

      "body": "@mzumsande I see. So the point isn't so much that you're trying to build something that tries to measure and converge towards an optimal long-term stalling timeout for your network conditions, but rather want something that deliberately gives a temporary \"cool down\" period after a stalling kick so it doesn't result in a flurry of disconnects.\r\n\r\nSo I think something like my suggestion still makes sense, but it's perhaps an orthogonal thing, and not for this PR.",
