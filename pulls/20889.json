    "body": "On top of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20876 only review this commit 3b9b0831d4ce152791e7953d175aa90b78008155\r\n\r\nThis PR gets rid of any side-effects that methods in `MiniWallet` might leave if an exception is thrown. ie beforehand, if `sendrawtransaction` failed we would have had an invalid utxo left in `self._utxos`. More subtle - beforehand, if `send_self_transfer` failed `self._utxos` is always going to be modified bc the first thing `send_self_transfer` does is sort `self._utxos`. I think this is confusing, especially if tests are catching exceptions\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm being paranoid with `generate`, and side-effects probably wouldn't cause as much confusion here. But originally, if anything failed in the for-loop https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...mjdietzx:test-miniwallet-no-side-effects?expand=1#diff-7932a60a9127fd22d10d367526fd7b987f9647ce017595f8b1af5c32d5db0083L38-L40 then `self._utxos` would include utxos for all items processed before the failure. Seems like we'd prefer no side-effect to me\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.
