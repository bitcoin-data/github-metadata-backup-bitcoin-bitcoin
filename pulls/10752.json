      "body": "> Nit: We expect to find primitives/transaction.h locally in src/.\r\n\r\nutACK as it matches the common convention better.\r\n\r\nThough sometimes I wonder whether this convention is a good idea. `include <>` searches relative to the include paths, `include \"\"` relative to the directory of the current source file, then the include paths. We know `primitives/` is relative to the source root of the repository, so it doesn't really need to look anywhere else. Especially not if it is already in `primitives/`, e.g. \r\n- when `primitives/block.h` includes `\"primitives/transaction.h\"`, then it makes it look in `src/primitives/primitives`\r\n- when `src/wallet/feebumper.h` includes `\"primitives/transaction.h\"`, it makes it look in `src/wallet/primitives`!\r\n\r\nSo with regard to unambiguity, this is a change for the worse.",

There is one commit updating declarations and callers, followed by two MOVEONLY commits actually moving the function bodies.\r\n\r\nThis change is desirable because wallet.h/cpp are monolithic and hard to navigate, so pulling things out and grouping together pieces of related functionality should improve the organization.\r\n\r\nAnother motivation is the wallet process separation work in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10973, where (at least initially) parameter parsing and fee estimation are still done in the main process rather than the wallet process, and having functions that run in different processes scrambled up throughout wallet.cpp is unnecessarily confusing.",

For example right now when `primitives/block.h` includes \"primitives/transaction.h\", it will look in `src/primitives/primitives` first.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes by number are in `src/qt` as all the source files there assume that they can include from there. I've separated this out, so that we could decide to do this only for non-qt files first ,for example.\r\n\r\nPing @theuni @ryanofsky",
