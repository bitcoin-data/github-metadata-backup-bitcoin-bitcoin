    "body": "For large wallets with many transactions and keys, inserting and fetching from a `std::map` can have a performance impact. Since we largely do not rely on the sorting properties of `std::map`, we can use `std::unordered_map` instead which is a hash table and insertion and retrieval are constant time. We also use `std::unordered_multimap` for some things that were `std::multimap`.\r\n\r\nThe changed maps are:\r\n* `mapWallet`: Map of all transactions\r\n* `mapTxSpends`: Map of outpoints to the txids of the txs that spent them\r\n*`mapKeyMetadata`: Map of key metadata\r\n*`mapScriptMetadata`: Map of script metadata\r\n*`mapKeys`: Map of private keys\r\n*`mapCryptedKeys`: Map of encrypted private keys\r\n*`mapWatchKeys`: Set of watch only keys.\r\n*`setWatchOnly`: Set of watch only scripts (std::unordered_set, not a map)\r\n\r\nChange `mapWallet` and `mapTxSpends` did require a few other changes and thus they are in their own commits. Additionally, the GUI relied on getting transactions from the wallet in a sorted order which unordered_map does not provide, so the commit \"Change getWalletTxs to return a set instead of a vector\" is needed in order to put all of the txs into a std::set (which is ordered) instead of a vector in order to retain the same behavior.\r\n\r\n`mapTxSpends` also relied on the sorted order to have some quick lookups, but these were changed to just do normal lookups over the same thing. It should be just as fast, or even faster, since std::unordered_map is a hash table.\r\n\r\nThe hash function used for these unordered maps and sets is SipHash, using the SipHash module that we already have. `SaltedTxidHasher` and `SaltedOutPointHasher` were moved from their original locations in utxo set and validation code in order to also be used from the wallet. Additionally `SaltedIDHasher` was added to hash uint160s (i.e. `CKeyID` and `CScriptID`) and `SaltedScriptHasher` was added to hash `CScript`s.\r\n\r\nI did some becnhmarks with a large wallet I created on regtest using [this script](https://gist.github.com/achow101/f24309bba501cc08c9a3a3d55fa6eec6). This wallet is 169 MB in size with 117035 transactions and 103264 keys. It took ~20 secs to load on master, and ~18 secs with this change. So this change reduces wallet loading time by ~10%.",
