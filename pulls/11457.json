    "body": "BanMan is not a bad Man, he's just a different class of Man. He's an ex-ConnMan Man, looking to take a different path and make a new namespace for himself.\r\n\r\nBeware BanMan's banhammer as he banishes bandits with the bandwidth to jam him. Not standing for non-canon, he’ll ban and he’ll ban. Some heroes wear capes, but BanMan? A Bandana.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDespite the diff size, this is mostly move-only. It breaks the ban/unban functions out of CConnman and into a new class because, while logically bans are tied to connections, they're really just entries in a database. Like CConnman, a global is still required due to RPC (and qt). I plan to address this along with CAddrMan, which I'll be breaking out next.\r\n\r\nThis also makes testing easier as different implementations can be dropped in.\r\n\r\nThere are a few small behavioral changes here, which are pretty insignificant:\r\n- Banning no longer implies disconnecting. If you want both, you need to call both.\r\n- For simplicity, The ban db is read in the constructor, meaning that it happens in init rather than net.\r\n- RPC returns RPC_DATABASE_ERROR if the bandb is not loaded. This should not be possible now, but the idea is for future changes to allow us to disable p2p but still interact with the ban commands.",

All `CCriticalSection`:s in the code base except `m_cs_callbacks_pending` are named with the `cs_` prefix (as opposed to `m_cs_`). Is `m_cs_` the recommended prefix going forward? More specifically, what prefix is recommended for my work in #10866? :-)\r\n\r\nI think there is a point in having consistent naming for the locks in order to allow for easy grepping of the locks. Personally I use grepping frequently (e.g. `git grep ' cs_[a-zA-Z0-9]\\+;' -- \"*.h\" \"*.cpp\"`) in the scripts that keep tracks of the locks to cover in #10866).",

Any excuse to pull stuff out of init and put knowledge of a module in that module instead of init seems like the right direction to me. Also because we're telling the scheduler to schedule calling a function in that module based on a timer set in that module's header just seems...weird to me. If we want to ensure its easy to add unit tests later you can easily make the scheduler an optional arg and skip dumping if one isn't provided to the constructor.",

There's no reason for BanMan to know about it, and it's not exclusive to net. Throwing in an app-specific schedule would kinda defeat the purpose of breaking it out.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised the scheduler would be considered \"bitcoind specific\" / \"app-specific\" but BanMan would not be. How could that be true? On the surface, it seems reasonable for BanMan to use the scheduler since it relies on a scheduler to function, and would seem to simplify init.cpp and anything else using BanMan.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  ",

The scheduler would just be a needless dependency.\r\n\r\n@TheBlueMatt It's time to create an app context class (and .h/cpp) anyway, that holds these types of objects for the life of bitcoind.
