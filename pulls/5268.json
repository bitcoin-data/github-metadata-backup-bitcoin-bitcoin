That's likely to hurt more than help. In this case, qt build\nfailed, and on the second attempt, it appeared to be successful. However, due\nto a bad object from an internal gcc error on the first build, the resulting\nlib was unusable. This caused bitcoin-qt to not be built, and tests and\npackaging which expected bitcoin-qt to be there failed.\n\nThe root cause:\nMingw is especially crashy when using -jX, likely compounded by low-memory\nenvironments. I've seen multiple problems with this combo in Gitian as well.\n\nIn this case:\ni686-w64-mingw32-g++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)\n...\nmake[3]: **\\* [.obj/release/qdrawhelper.o] Error 4\n\nThe workaround:\nBump Travis down to using -j2 by default. Additionaly, enable --with-gui for\nthe windows builds. This will cause configure to fail if qt is not working\nwhile also testing the config flag.\n\nOther failures which may be worth revisiting separately:\n- If a depends package fails, maybe remove the workdir so that it doesn't taint\n  subsequent runs\n- See if there's anything repeatable about the ICE when building qt\n",

      "message": "travis: attempt to fix unlikely build issue\n\nThis is a long chain of errors, and there are likely other changes that could\nbe made to cope in other places along that chain.\n\nIf depends don't build successfully, don't bother trying again for the sake of\nbetter logging. That's likely to hurt more than help. In this case, qt build\nfailed, and on the second attempt, it appeared to be successful. However, due\nto a bad object from an internal gcc error on the first build, the resulting\nlib was unusable. This caused bitcoin-qt to not be built, and tests and\npackaging which expected bitcoin-qt to be there failed.\n\nThe root cause:\nMingw is especially crashy when using -jX, likely compounded by low-memory\nenvironments. I've seen multiple problems with this combo in Gitian as well.\n\nIn this case:\ni686-w64-mingw32-g++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)\n...\nmake[3]: *** [.obj/release/qdrawhelper.o] Error 4\n\nThe workaround:\nBump Travis down to using -j2 by default. Additionaly, enable --with-gui for\nthe windows builds. This will cause configure to fail if qt is not working\nwhile also testing the config flag.\n\nOther failures which may be worth revisiting separately:\n- If a depends package fails, maybe remove the workdir so that it doesn't taint\n  subsequent runs\n- See if there's anything repeatable about the ICE when building qt",
