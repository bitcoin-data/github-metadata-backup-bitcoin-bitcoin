Sorry to rant, but I'm starting to feel quite strongly about this:\r\n\r\nIf you want to make changes like this, the way to do so is:\r\n\r\n- create a PR to update the coding guidelines with your motivation on how this avoids bugs (as you did in the OP), and that your point is strong enough for this to be merged\r\n- if it is merged, make sure it is applied to **new code**, in reviews\r\n- then maybe, in the longer term, if people agree that this is important, do a PR that updates old occurrences\r\n\r\nPlease don't create a PR out of the blue that changes some formerly unheard-of thing in the entire codebase. This creates review work, extra risk, and all massive idempotent code changes all over the code make it harder to keep track of what is actually changing.",
