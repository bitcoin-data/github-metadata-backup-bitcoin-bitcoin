    "body": "This adds a `-whitelist` option to specify subnet ranges from which peers that connect are whitelisted. In addition, there is a `-whitebind` option which works like `-bind`, except peers connecting to it are also whitelisted (allowing a separate listen port for trusted connections).\n\nBeing whitelisted has two effects (for now):\n- They are immune to DoS banning.\n- Transactions they broadcast (which are valid) are always relayed, even if they were already in the mempool. This means that a node can function as a gateway for a local network, and that rebroadcasts from the local network will work as expected.\n\nWhitelisting replaces the magic exemption localhost had for DoS banning, which implies hidden service connects (from a localhost Tor node) were incorrectly immune to DoS banning as well. This old behaviour is removed for that reason, but can be restored using `-whitelist=127.0.0.1` or `-whitelist=::1`. `-whitebind` is safer to use in case non-trusted localhost connections are expected (like hidden services).\n\nThis is a partial replacement for #3403 (but does not add RPC commands to make whitelisting dynamic). Also, hhitelisting becomes a boolean property of a peer here (set at connect time), rather than defined by a set of netmasks. This means we don't need to match the address on every invocation of a relay.\n",

I would suggest inverting the problem, to achieve a more secure result:\n- Add -torbind (-shadybind?), where all incoming connections are untrusted, and point Tor hidden service at this port\n- Mark connections coming into this port with a special taint flag, so that they _cannot_ be whitelisted\n\nI think it would be useful to distinguish between localhost and Tor in any case.

The harm of being whitelisted inappropriately is also small—  though I'm a little worried that the unconditional relaying is a little bit too powerful... since it does make you into a blind attack multiplier.\n\nThis is also a little coarse in that immunity from ban is not the same as immunity from disconnection.  I think localhost should still remain immune from banning, without being immune from disconnection. (disconnection suffers no overkill)\n",

Banning all onion peers because one behaves is the wrong behavior (and creates a vulnerability where we currently have none: a single trouble maker could turn off bitcoin on tor cheaply, in order to be able to deanonymize users when they drop off tor to get things working).\n",

In addition, there is a -whitebind option\nwhich works like -bind, except peers connecting to it are also\nwhitelisted (allowing a separate listen port for trusted connections).\n\nBeing whitelisted has two effects (for now):\n* They are immune to DoS disconnection/banning.\n* Transactions they broadcast (which are valid) are always relayed,\n  even if they were already in the mempool. This means that a node\n  can function as a gateway for a local network, and that rebroadcasts\n  from the local network will work as expected.\n\nWhitelisting replaces the magic exemption localhost had for DoS\ndisconnection (local addresses are still never banned, though), which\nimplied hidden service connects (from a localhost Tor node) were\nincorrectly immune to DoS disconnection as well. This old\nbehaviour is removed for that reason, but can be restored using\n-whitelist=127.0.0.1 or -whitelist=::1 can be specified. -whitebind\nis safer to use in case non-trusted localhost connections are expected\n(like hidden services).",
