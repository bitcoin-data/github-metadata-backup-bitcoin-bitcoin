    "body": "- [x] **Prerequisite PR**: #12431 (it wouldn't be catastrophic to merge this before that, but preferable to get that in first.)\r\n\r\nIn trying to fix the fork warning code (`validation.cpp:CheckForkWarningConditions*`), it became apparent that we are marking some (but not all) invalid blocks as invalid (via `nStatus`) when they are received and subsequently dropped. The fact that we never mark some invalid blocks as such prevents us from e.g. detecting and warning on invalid chains with significant work.\r\n\r\nThis change has `ProcessNewBlock` call `InvalidateBlock` on the invalid block to do the expected bookkeeping in `mapBlockIndex` before dropping the block.\r\n\r\nThis change also consolidates the setting of CBlockIndex's `nStatus |= BLOCK_FAILED_VALID` to a single function (`InvalidBlockFound`) since there's peripheral bookkeeping (e.g. `g_failed_blocks.insert()`) that we want to do consistently but is duplicated in some places or not done in other cases when it apparently should be. \r\n\r\n[One such replacement with InvalidBlockFound](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12407/files?diff=unified#diff-24efdb00bfbe56b140fb006b562cc70bL3420) ensures addition of invalid blocks to `g_failed_blocks` and so (in theory) reduces CPU burden when being spammed with descendants of an invalid block, since we no longer have to walk `mapBlockIndex` to determine its invalidity. Based on reading usage of `g_failed_blocks` I can't tell if this savings is real, but in any case it seems worthwhile to keep that set consistent (i.e. 1-1 with blocks marked BLOCK_FAILED_VALID since last restart).",

Seems a little ugly.\r\n\r\nIs the bookkeeping this PR wants to do even worth it? I guess we could just lump long invalid forks in with long headers-only forks, but that doesn't seem great either...",

      "body": "Thanks @ryanofsky and @sipa for the re-review. I've incorporated @sipa's change (remove unconditional log in `InvalidBlockFound` when corruption is possible), rebased, and updated the PR description to better reflect the change's contents. I've added some text discussing the refactoring, reproduced here\r\n\r\n> This change also consolidates the setting of CBlockIndex's `nStatus |= BLOCK_FAILED_VALID` to a single function (`InvalidBlockFound`) since there's peripheral bookkeeping (e.g. `g_failed_blocks.insert()`) that we want to do consistently but is duplicated in some places or not done in other cases when it apparently should be. \r\n> \r\n> [One such replacement with InvalidBlockFound](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12407/files?diff=unified#diff-24efdb00bfbe56b140fb006b562cc70bL3420) ensures addition of invalid blocks to `g_failed_blocks` and so (in theory) reduces CPU burden when being spammed with descendants of an invalid block, since we no longer have to walk `mapBlockIndex` to determine its invalidity. Based on reading usage of `g_failed_blocks` I can't tell if this savings is real, but in any case it seems worthwhile to keep that set consistent (i.e. 1-1 with blocks marked BLOCK_FAILED_VALID since last restart).",
