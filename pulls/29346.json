    "body": "Parent PR #29432 \r\n\r\nThis is the first part of the Stratum v2 Template Provider change that can be a standalone pull request.\r\n\r\nThe Noise Protocol Framework is defined here: https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html\r\n\r\nIt's quite similar to BIP324. The main differences are explained here, including why Stratum v2 can't use BIP234 (yet): https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stratum-v2-noise-protocol-bip324-nuggets/413\r\n\r\nThe implementation is based on revision 38, 2018-07-11 (most recent at the time of writing).\r\n\r\nThe Stratum v2 spec defines the specific choice of ciphers: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/04-Protocol-Security.md\r\n\r\nThis protocol has been implemented in the Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI, using [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin)). https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum\r\n\r\nIt has also been (independently) implemented in BraiinsOS. This part is currently not open source, and it's behind on some recent changes.\r\n\r\nThe classes in `sv2_noise.h` attempt to stay close to the paper, whereas the test and fuzzer code borrow heavily from BIP324.\r\n\r\nIt's ready for review, but not for merge:\r\n\r\n1. The parent PR may need more conceptual review (and perhaps the entire spec, but that would really slow things down)\r\n2. We could decide to not support Noise encryption at all and require users to install separate software for that. Code review of this PR could help inform that decision.\r\n\r\nYou can see this code in action in the parent PR #29432.\r\n\r\nInitial seed corpus: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/169\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe following spec change is already implemented in this PR and in SRI:\r\n\r\n* The spec is being modified to use EllSwift (instead of regular x-only) for the encoding of public keys and ECDH: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66",

Expanded the fuzzer to send multiple messages back and forth (like the BIP324 fuzzer).\r\n\r\nI dropped the 1 hour wiggle room in certificate timestamps, because it adds complexity and I don't expect this to cause any issues in practice. A self-signed certificate is generated when the TemplateProvider loads, which is unlikely the same second someone connects to it.\r\n\r\nThe fuzzer found a bug where I forgot to defragment messages larger than the chunk size. Since the Template Provider generally only _sends_ large messages, this (probably) wasn't caught in testing.\r\n\r\n`DecryptAndHash` was broken in a way that my initial tests didn't catch (not sure why), nor interoperability tests because this iniator-side function is only used in test code. But I managed to break something in the ensuing refactor, will clean it up later...\r\n\r\n[it's currently in a broken state, second ECDH handshake gives different result, maybe due to bad memory management]",

Code review of this PR could help inform that decision.\r\n\r\nI'm just starting to look at this PR and #29432, and having separate software to handle the encryption and networking does seem like a pretty appealing approach.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if the goal is to directly add support for the stratum protocol to bitcoin core, I think it would be good to have a little more separation between the stratum and node code, so instead of accessing the [mempool](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/5825cd80a6d67543f62757f29e0d27117209f2f4/src/node/sv2_template_provider.cpp#L274) and [blockassembler](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/5825cd80a6d67543f62757f29e0d27117209f2f4/src/node/sv2_template_provider.cpp#L480C26-L480C70) and [chainman](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/5825cd80a6d67543f62757f29e0d27117209f2f4/src/node/sv2_template_provider.cpp#L726) and [g_best_block](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/5825cd80a6d67543f62757f29e0d27117209f2f4/src/node/sv2_template_provider.cpp#L265) directly, the stratum code would call a more well-defined interface. This could be a new interface class in `src/interfaces/` called something like `MiningServer` or `BlockTemplateProvider` with a few methods for polling the mempool and chainstate, generating block templates and submitting new blocks.\r\n\r\nI think this would be good in longer term to have more decoupling and potential process and project separation. But it could also help review in shorter term, by giving reviewers like me who are more familiar with bitcoin core code than with the stratum protocol another entry point for understanding the code.",

Store the interface in NodeContext like:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7fcf4e99791ca5be0b068ac03a81a50ece11dba3/src/node/context.h#L71\r\n\r\nInitialize in the init.cpp file like:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7fcf4e99791ca5be0b068ac03a81a50ece11dba3/src/init.cpp#L1113\r\n\r\nYou could just copy the makeChain method there, which has the boilerplate used to instantiate the interface and give it access to the chainstate and mempool.\r\n\r\nThen add an Ensure function like you mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/server_util.h\r\n\r\nI'd maybe call the interface something like MiningService or TemplateProvider rather than MiningContext. I think of \"Context\" as being a passive container for state instead of an object you would call methods on. The top level interfaces like `interfaces::Chain` `interface::Node` `interfaces::Wallet` are actually stateless themselves, and only point to state stored in other places. (The idea is to let interface instances be created and destroyed freely, since with multiprocess support new processes can connect and create interface pointers that get destroyed on disconnection, and the state of the node shouldn't be affected too much from connections and disconnections. Anyway, the mining interface could follow this pattern.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am also still curious about the idea to \"to not support Noise encryption at all and require users to install separate software.\" I'm not sure if this has already been discussed somewhere or if you have more thoughts on it. Looking at this PR, the noise protocol implementation does not seem too complicated, and seems like it would not be a big deal to review and maintain as part of bitcoin core, but I'm not sure yet about the rest of the mining protocol. I'm also not sure how much work it would be to create separate software, if there could be a middle ground for mining support like there is for gui support, which is distributed with bitcoin core, but in a separate executable and with a separate github repository.",

      "body": "> if you have more thoughts on it\r\n\r\nWhenever I talk to people interested in using Stratum v2 I find it difficult to explain all the moving parts they need to install and configure.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n* a separate Bitcoin Core branch (temporary, pending #29432 merge)\r\n* a job declaration client\r\n* a sv1-sv2 translator (temporary, pending sv2 firmware support)\r\n\r\nConfigure:\r\n* point job declaration client to Bitcoin Core, to the pools job declaration server and to the pool itself\r\n* point translator to job declaration client\r\n* point miner to translator\r\n* various public keys for noise encryption (optionally private key and certificate)\r\n\r\nIdeally mining should be as easy as: install Bitcoin Core, paste a single [pool URL](https://academy.braiins.com/en/braiins-pool/btc-mining-setup/#stratum-v2-endpoints-servers-and-ports) into Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nIn my ideal scenario the miner would find Bitcoin Core via mDNS, but that's a fresh can of worms that I haven't thought through in great detail. So instead a user will have to point to Bitcoin Core in the miner interface (typically a web server running on the device) [0].\r\n\r\nTo get there we'd have to implement not just the Template Provider role (#29432), but also the Job Declarator role. Additionally we'd have to implement either a (simple) Mining Proxy _or_ finish the Job Distribution Protocol spec, so that the miner can communicate directly with the pool. See the protocol overview: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/03-Protocol-Overview.md \r\n\r\nTo keep #29432 manageable, and because I don't know if we want to add that much mining functionality, I haven't done this. Instead the user has to install and configure the SRI Job Declarator client role, which also acts as a Proxy role. Probably on the same machine as the node.\r\n\r\nWe talk to the SRI software using noise encryption, but we _could_ also talk to it with a unix socket. That is, if SRI adds support for that. Regardless of the transport layer, we have to support the sv2 protocol messages.\r\n\r\nImplementing Noise encryption (and the sv2 protocol messages) now gives us the flexibility later to take over the Job Declarator client and Proxy role, removing the need to install SRI. At least for simple setups, e.g. a single ASIC (so the proxy doesn't have to worry about how to distribute work).\r\n\r\nIIUC the [Job Declarator client role](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/06-Job-Declaration-Protocol.md) was designed to keep the Template Provider role easier to implement. To take it over we'd have to implement a few more messages: `AllocateMiningJobToken`, `DeclareMiningJob`, `IdentifyTransactions` and `SubmitSolution`. The `IdentifyTransactions` part is similar to how compact blocks work, where we only send full transactions to the pool if they don't already have them.\r\n\r\nWhile taking over the Job Declarator client role seems like a fairly straight-forward followup, taking over the Mining Proxy role is perhaps less so. Designing and implementing a Job Distribution Protocol, which IIUC avoids the need to implement a Mining Proxy, may be a better path. The user would then configure their miner to point to Bitcoin Core for templates as well as to the pool to submit shares.\r\n\r\nIf in the end we decide to do neither, then perhaps implementing noise was overkill. But as you point out it's not that complicated.\r\n\r\nAny complexity can be hidden from user with node-in-a-box solutions like Umbrel, but it's nice if they can just use Bitcoin Core. Having a separate binary maintained by us, like HWI, adds installation and configuration complexity. For HWI that's unavoidable because we don't want to include the USB driver kitchen sink.\r\n\r\nI don't think simplicity is merely nice for amateur home miners with a single S9 space heater; I suspect even small scale \"professional\" miners are not sys-admins. Running and configuring a seperate job declarator client process making sure it restarts after a crash is non-trivial. Much easier to just point the miner directly to a pool and not bother with custom template creation. So imo we need to lower the barrier as much as (safely) possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn additional argument for implementing noise encryption support, completely separate from the above setup complexity, is that it allows making the template provider publicly reachable. I'm still a bit skeptical about that use case, but see discussion here: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/issues/63#issuecomment-1866515958\r\n\r\n[0] on a hypothetical stratum v2 aware miner that is, which doesn't exist. Today you have to point the miner to a sv1 - sv2 translator which runs on your computer. This translator points to your job declarator client.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nUpdate 2024-06-12: more conceptual discussion on what work Bitcoin Core could / should (not) take over from the Job Declarator client role: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/discussions/85 ",

Thus, Noise Protocol integration allows for the following:\r\n\r\n1. Implement the Template Provider (TP) role and the Template Distribution Protocol into Bitcoin and point to SRI software for the Job Declarator Client (JDC) and Mining Proxy.\r\n2. Implement the Template Provider (TP), Job Declarator Client (JDC) roles, and Template Distribution and Job Distribution protocols into Bitcoin and point to SRI software for Mining Proxy. This option makes the life of amateur miners easier since they do not need to configure a third party JDC.\r\n3. The Template Provider (TP) can be publicly reachable.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, and if it is decided to aim for the incorporation of the Template Provider (TP), Job Declarator Client (JDC) and Mining Proxy into Bitcoin, the Noise Protocol can facilitate all the interim solutions until the rest of the modules are production ready.",

Pool and JDS do not need to communicate (and if they do they do not use the job declaration protocol)\r\n2. JDS and TP do not communicate using the template distribution protocol.
