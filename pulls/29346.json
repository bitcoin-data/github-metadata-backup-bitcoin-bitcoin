    "body": "Parent PR #29432 \r\n\r\nThis is the first part of the Stratum v2 Template Provider change that can be a standalone pull request.\r\n\r\nThe Noise Protocol Framework is defined here: https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html\r\n\r\nIt's quite similar to BIP324. The main differences are explained here, including why Stratum v2 can't use BIP234 (yet): https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stratum-v2-noise-protocol-bip324-nuggets/413\r\n\r\nThe implementation is based on revision 38, 2018-07-11 (most recent at the time of writing).\r\n\r\nThe Stratum v2 spec defines the specific choice of ciphers: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/04-Protocol-Security.md\r\n\r\nThis protocol has been implemented in the Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI, using [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin)). https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum\r\n\r\nIt has also been (independently) implemented in BraiinsOS. This part is currently not open source, and it's behind on some recent changes.\r\n\r\nThe classes in `sv2_noise.h` attempt to stay close to the paper, whereas the test and fuzzer code borrow heavily from BIP324.\r\n\r\nIt's ready for review, but not for merge:\r\n\r\n1. The parent PR may need more conceptual review (and perhaps the entire spec, but that would really slow things down)\r\n2. We could decide to not support Noise encryption at all and require users to install separate software for that. Code review of this PR could help inform that decision.\r\n\r\nYou can see this code in action in the parent PR #29432.\r\n\r\nInitial seed corpus: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/169\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe following spec change is already implemented in this PR and in SRI:\r\n\r\n* The spec is being modified to use EllSwift (instead of regular x-only) for the encoding of public keys and ECDH: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66",

          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. See the original branch for the evolution of the spec.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review? \r\n\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review. Probably starting with ECDH and the Noise Protocol.\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nSilent Payments also needs the ECDH module, so I cherry-picked the commit from #28122. It uses ECDH is a slightly different way, but perhaps there's more overlap to be had.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Upstream issues\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Noise\r\n\r\n- [ ] use EllSwift https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66, implemented in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/28\r\n- [ ] certificate signing issue: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/717, fix in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/29\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [x] persist static key (needs #29229)\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [x] create `Sv2Transport` subclass similar to `V2Transport`: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/27\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n- [ ] adjust base58 encoding of authority public key https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/721\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [x] hold on to templates a bit after a block is found https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/709 (in case of race to prevent downstream crashes, though we still wouldn't relay it without additional changes)\r\n- [ ] hold on to template transactions even if the mempool drops them (for some time)\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Move `Split` functions from `util/spanparsing.h` to `util/string.h`, using `util` namespace for clarity.\r\n- Move remaining spanparsing functions to `script/parsing.h` since they are used for descriptor and miniscript parsing.\r\n- Combine `util/fees.h` and `util/errors.h` into `common/messages.h` so there is a place for simple functions that generate user messages to live, and these functions are not part of the util library.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change is that the util library is a dependency of the kernel, and we should remove functionality from util that shouldn't be called by kernel code or kernel applications. These changes should also improve code organization and make functions easier to discover. Some of these same moves are (or were) part of #28690, but did not help with code organization, or made it worse, so it is better to move them and clean them up in the same PR so code only has to change one time.\r\n",

But @vasild pointed out in #29229 that:\r\n\r\n> `CKey` stores sensitive data and takes care to wipe it from memory when freed. In #28983 `Read/WriteBinaryData()` is used in a way that defeats that - the sensitive data will be copied to a temporary variable (ordinary `std::vector`) for IO. Can we change `Read/WriteBinaryData()` to operate directly on `CKey` in such a way that data goes directly from `CKey` to the disk?\r\n\r\nThis PR tries a different approach that hopefully addresses that. See https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/32 for how it's used (in `sv2_template_provider.cpp`).",

A self-signed certificate is generated when the TemplateProvider loads, which is unlikely the same second someone connects to it.\r\n\r\nThe fuzzer found a bug where I forgot to defragment messages larger than the chunk size. Since the Template Provider generally only _sends_ large messages, this (probably) wasn't caught in testing.\r\n\r\n`DecryptAndHash` was broken in a way that my initial tests didn't catch (not sure why), nor interoperability tests because this iniator-side function is only used in test code.

The message should be signed by the authority key, but it's actually being checked against the static key.\r\n\r\nThe Template Provider in Bitcoin Core generated signatures with the same two issues.

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNext step after this PR is done will be to have the wallet do the private broadcast as well, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11887 would have to be resolved.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

The main changes are:\r\n\r\n- Previously, we would only calculate the time offset from the first 199 outbound peers that we connected to. This limitation is now removed, and we have a proper rolling calculation. I've reduced the set to 50 outbound peers, which seems plenty.\r\n- Previously, we would automatically use the network-adjusted time if the difference was < 70 mins, and warn the user if the difference was larger than that. Since there is no longer any automated time adjustment, I've changed the warning threshold to ~~20~~ 10 minutes (which is an arbitrary number).\r\n- Previously, a warning would only be raised once, and then never again until node restart. This behaviour is now updated to  1) warn to log for every new outbound peer for as long as we appear out of sync, 2) have the RPC warning toggled on/off whenever we go in/out of sync, and 3) have the GUI warn whenever we are out of sync (again), but limited to 1 messagebox per 60 minutes\r\n- no more globals\r\n- remove the `-maxtimeadjustment` startup arg\r\n\r\nCloses #4521",

          "body": "The current procedure for building the block filter index involves processing filters one at a time;\r\nReading blocks, undo data, and previous headers from disk sequentially.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new mechanism to perform the work concurrently. Dividing the filters\r\ngeneration workload among a pool of workers that can be configured by the user,\r\nsignificantly increasing the speed of the index construction process.\r\n\r\nThe same concurrent processing model has been applied to the transactions index as well.\r\n\r\nThe newly introduced init flag `-indexworkers=<n>` enables the concurrent sync\r\nbehavior.\r\nWhere \"n\" is the number of worker threads that will be spawned at startup to create ranges\r\nof block filters during the initial sync process. Destroying the workers pool once the\r\ninitial sync completes.\r\nNote: by default, the parallelized sync process is not enabled.\r\n\r\nNow the juicy part:\r\nIn my computer, with the node in debug mode and on IBD, with `-indexworkers=4`, the\r\nblock filter index generation took less than an hour. While, in master, the sync took more than 7 hours.\r\n\r\nImportant Note:\r\nAs the access to the block data on disk is protected by `cs_main`, this new feature runs substantially\r\nfaster when the node is not in IBD.\r\n\r\nFootnote:\r\nThis is part of a larger project :).",

Code review of this PR could help inform that decision.\r\n\r\nI'm just starting to look at this PR and #29432, and having separate software to handle the encryption and networking does seem like a pretty appealing approach.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if the goal is to directly add support for the stratum protocol to bitcoin core, I think it would be good to have a little more separation between the stratum and node code, so instead of accessing the [mempool](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/5825cd80a6d67543f62757f29e0d27117209f2f4/src/node/sv2_template_provider.cpp#L274) and [blockassembler](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/5825cd80a6d67543f62757f29e0d27117209f2f4/src/node/sv2_template_provider.cpp#L480C26-L480C70) and [chainman](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/5825cd80a6d67543f62757f29e0d27117209f2f4/src/node/sv2_template_provider.cpp#L726) and [g_best_block](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/5825cd80a6d67543f62757f29e0d27117209f2f4/src/node/sv2_template_provider.cpp#L265) directly, the stratum code would call a more well-defined interface. This could be a new interface class in `src/interfaces/` called something like `MiningServer` or `BlockTemplateProvider` with a few methods for polling the mempool and chainstate, generating block templates and submitting new blocks.\r\n\r\nI think this would be good in longer term to have more decoupling and potential process and project separation. But it could also help review in shorter term, by giving reviewers like me who are more familiar with bitcoin core code than with the stratum protocol another entry point for understanding the code.",

Store the interface in NodeContext like:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7fcf4e99791ca5be0b068ac03a81a50ece11dba3/src/node/context.h#L71\r\n\r\nInitialize in the init.cpp file like:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7fcf4e99791ca5be0b068ac03a81a50ece11dba3/src/init.cpp#L1113\r\n\r\nYou could just copy the makeChain method there, which has the boilerplate used to instantiate the interface and give it access to the chainstate and mempool.\r\n\r\nThen add an Ensure function like you mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/server_util.h\r\n\r\nI'd maybe call the interface something like MiningService or TemplateProvider rather than MiningContext. I think of \"Context\" as being a passive container for state instead of an object you would call methods on. The top level interfaces like `interfaces::Chain` `interface::Node` `interfaces::Wallet` are actually stateless themselves, and only point to state stored in other places. (The idea is to let interface instances be created and destroyed freely, since with multiprocess support new processes can connect and create interface pointers that get destroyed on disconnection, and the state of the node shouldn't be affected too much from connections and disconnections. Anyway, the mining interface could follow this pattern.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am also still curious about the idea to \"to not support Noise encryption at all and require users to install separate software.\" I'm not sure if this has already been discussed somewhere or if you have more thoughts on it. Looking at this PR, the noise protocol implementation does not seem too complicated, and seems like it would not be a big deal to review and maintain as part of bitcoin core, but I'm not sure yet about the rest of the mining protocol. I'm also not sure how much work it would be to create separate software, if there could be a middle ground for mining support like there is for gui support, which is distributed with bitcoin core, but in a separate executable and with a separate github repository.",

      "body": "> if you have more thoughts on it\r\n\r\nWhenever I talk to people interested in using Stratum v2 I find it difficult to explain all the moving parts they need to install and configure.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n* a separate Bitcoin Core branch (temporary, pending #29432 merge)\r\n* a job declaration client\r\n* a sv1-sv2 translator (temporary, pending sv2 firmware support)\r\n\r\nConfigure:\r\n* point job declaration client to Bitcoin Core, to the pools job declaration server and to the pool itself\r\n* point translator to job declaration client\r\n* point miner to translator\r\n* various public keys for noise encryption (optionally private key and certificate)\r\n\r\nIdeally mining should be as easy as: install Bitcoin Core, paste a single [pool URL](https://academy.braiins.com/en/braiins-pool/btc-mining-setup/#stratum-v2-endpoints-servers-and-ports) into Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nIn my ideal scenario the miner would find Bitcoin Core via mDNS, but that's a fresh can of worms that I haven't thought through in great detail. So instead a user will have to point to Bitcoin Core in the miner interface (typically a web server running on the device) [0].\r\n\r\nTo get there we'd have to implement not just the Template Provider role (#29432), but also the Job Declarator role. Additionally we'd have to implement either a (simple) Mining Proxy _or_ finish the Job Distribution Protocol spec, so that the miner can communicate directly with the pool. See the protocol overview: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/03-Protocol-Overview.md \r\n\r\nTo keep #29432 manageable, and because I don't know if we want to add that much mining functionality, I haven't done this. Instead the user has to install and configure the SRI Job Declarator client role, which also acts as a Proxy role. Probably on the same machine as the node.\r\n\r\nWe talk to the SRI software using noise encryption, but we _could_ also talk to it with a unix socket. That is, if SRI adds support for that. Regardless of the transport layer, we have to support the sv2 protocol messages.\r\n\r\nImplementing Noise encryption (and the sv2 protocol messages) now gives us the flexibility later to take over the Job Declarator client and Proxy role, removing the need to install SRI. At least for simple setups, e.g. a single ASIC (so the proxy doesn't have to worry about how to distribute work).\r\n\r\nIIUC the [Job Declarator client role](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/06-Job-Declaration-Protocol.md) was designed to keep the Template Provider role easier to implement. To take it over we'd have to implement a few more messages: `AllocateMiningJobToken`, `DeclareMiningJob`, `IdentifyTransactions` and `SubmitSolution`. The `IdentifyTransactions` part is similar to how compact blocks work, where we only send full transactions to the pool if they don't already have them.\r\n\r\nWhile taking over the Job Declarator client role seems like a fairly straight-forward followup, taking over the Mining Proxy role is perhaps less so. Designing and implementing a Job Distribution Protocol, which IIUC avoids the need to implement a Mining Proxy, may be a better path. The user would then configure their miner to point to Bitcoin Core for templates as well as to the pool to submit shares.\r\n\r\nIf in the end we decide to do neither, then perhaps implementing noise was overkill. But as you point out it's not that complicated.\r\n\r\nAny complexity can be hidden from user with node-in-a-box solutions like Umbrel, but it's nice if they can just use Bitcoin Core. Having a separate binary maintained by us, like HWI, adds installation and configuration complexity. For HWI that's unavoidable because we don't want to include the USB driver kitchen sink.\r\n\r\nI don't think simplicity is merely nice for amateur home miners with a single S9 space heater; I suspect even small scale \"professional\" miners are not sys-admins. Running and configuring a seperate job declarator client process making sure it restarts after a crash is non-trivial. Much easier to just point the miner directly to a pool and not bother with custom template creation. So imo we need to lower the barrier as much as (safely) possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn additional argument for implementing noise encryption support, completely separate from the above setup complexity, is that it allows making the template provider publicly reachable. I'm still a bit skeptical about that use case, but see discussion here: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/issues/63#issuecomment-1866515958\r\n\r\n[0] on a hypothetical stratum v2 aware miner that is, which doesn't exist. Today you have to point the miner to a sv1 - sv2 translator which runs on your computer. This translator points to your job declarator client.",
