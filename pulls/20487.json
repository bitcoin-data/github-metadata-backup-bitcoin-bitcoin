    "body": "Add experimental syscall sandboxing using seccomp-bpf (Linux secure computing mode).\r\n\r\nEnable filtering of system calls using seccomp-bpf: allow only explicitly allowlisted (expected) syscalls to be called. \r\n\r\nThe syscall sandboxing implemented in this PR is an experimental feature currently available only under Linux x86-64.\r\n\r\nTo enable the experimental syscall sandbox the `-sandbox=<mode>` option must be passed to `bitcoind`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  -sandbox=<mode>\r\n       Use the experimental syscall sandbox in the specified mode\r\n       (-sandbox=log-and-abort or -sandbox=abort). Allow only expected\r\n       syscalls to be used by bitcoind. Note that this is an\r\n       experimental new feature that may cause bitcoind to exit or crash\r\n       unexpectedly: use with caution. In the \"log-and-abort\" mode the\r\n       invocation of an unexpected syscall results in a debug handler\r\n       being invoked which will log the incident and terminate the\r\n       program (without executing the unexpected syscall). In the\r\n       \"abort\" mode the invocation of an unexpected syscall results in\r\n       the entire process being killed immediately by the kernel without\r\n       executing the unexpected syscall.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe allowed syscalls are defined on a per thread basis.\r\n\r\nI've used this feature since summer 2020 and I find it to be a helpful testing/debugging addition which makes it much easier to reason about the actual capabilities required of each type of thread in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nQuick start guide:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./configure\r\n$ src/bitcoind -regtest -debug=util -sandbox=log-and-abort\r\n…\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Experimental syscall sandbox enabled (-sandbox=log-and-abort): bitcoind will terminate if an unexpected (not allowlisted) syscall is invoked.\r\n…\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"addcon\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"dnsseed\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"net\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"msghand\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"opencon\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"init\"\r\n…\r\n# A simulated execve call to show the sandbox in action:\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z ERROR: The syscall \"execve\" (syscall number 59) is not allowed by the syscall sandbox in thread \"msghand\". Please report.\r\n…\r\nAborted (core dumped)\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[About seccomp and seccomp-bpf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp):\r\n\r\n> In computer security, seccomp (short for secure computing mode) is a facility in the Linux kernel. seccomp allows a process to make a one-way transition into a \"secure\" state where it cannot make any system calls except exit(), sigreturn(), and read() and write() to already-open file descriptors. Should it attempt any other system calls, the kernel will terminate the process with SIGKILL or SIGSYS. In this sense, it does not virtualize the system's resources but isolates the process from them entirely.\r\n>\r\n> […]\r\n> \r\n> seccomp-bpf is an extension to seccomp that allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy implemented using Berkeley Packet Filter rules. It is used by OpenSSH and vsftpd as well as the Google Chrome/Chromium web browsers on Chrome OS and Linux. (In this regard seccomp-bpf achieves similar functionality, but with more flexibility and higher performance, to the older systrace—which seems to be no longer supported for Linux.)",

Generic libc functions are implemented differently depending on whether you're using Alpine (musl) or Debian (glibc). This means that the same libc function may require different system calls.\r\n\r\nWhile this is about C, it also applies to C++ in many parts. There's no guarantee that the current approaches works on all libc++ implementation. Also there is no guarantee that for example clangs libc++ might use different syscalls in future versions. This could lead to an unsustainable and unportable design of the implementation.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's better focusing on BSDs sandboxing mechanisms (pledge(2) and capsicum(2)) instead as they are more somewhat stable compared to Linux.",

      "body": "@emilengler \r\n\r\nThe syscall sandbox works on an allowlist basis. Thus if the kernel provides two different syscalls to achieve a certain action, and both those syscalls are used by the different standard library implementations then both syscalls should be put in the allowlist (if we want to allow said action).\r\n\r\nThat is inherent in all types of syscall sandboxing designs, no matter if Linux seccomp-bpf or some BSD equivalent is used.\r\n\r\nAs have been noted in previous discussions above syscall sandboxing is a type of feature that needs experimentation and fine-tuning for different environments to catch potential diversity in syscall use across systems. Such experimentation was required when sandboxing using seccomp-bpf was introduced in projects such as Chromium, OpenSSH and Tor, and it will be required for Bitcoin Core too. There is really no way around it :)\r\n\r\nThat's why this is labeled an experimental feature that is disabled by default, and is enabled only after \"dual opt-in\" (compile-time opt-in via `--with-sandbox` _and_ run-time opt-in via `-sandbox`). To be clear: this is very much *not* a feature for the average end-user at this stage :)\r\n\r\nI think having this feature in CI only would be a very good start: that would allow us to catch introduction of crazy syscall usage (say opening a network connection in a thread that is not supposed to do so, etc.), and get a chance to play with sandboxing in practice.\r\n\r\nFWIW I've been using this feature for roughly a year in different environments. I've found this feature to be a very helpful testing/debugging addition which makes it much easier to reason about the actual capabilities required of each type of thread in Bitcoin Core.",

      "body": "Thanks for all the followups! The new Setup call is easier to understand, and it's great to see configuration moved from build time to runtime so there is more usage flexibility and less chaos in the build script.\r\n\r\nMain remaining suggestion would be to rename `--with-sandbox` option to `--with-seccomp` to follow more a traditional autoconf convention of using `--with-*` options for dependencies and `--enable-*` options for features. This would also be more futureproof for supporting alternative sandboxing mechanisms on linux, and different sandboxing mechanisms on other platforms.\r\n\r\nOther suggestions:\r\n\r\n- The `--with-` option should just be automatically detected like other dependencies, and not required to be specified manually. Sandboxing is experimental, but it's already disabled by default, and doesn't need to be disabled twice as much. Autodetection would also allow dropping the cirrus CI changes in this PR and avoid the new sandboxing feature creating a new build and test variant.\r\n- The `--with-sandbox and --enable-multiprocess are currently incompatible` build error would be good to drop. The multiprocess and sandboxing features for now maybe don't work together at runtime, but there's no build conflict.\r\n- Various `#if defined(USE_SYSCALL_SANDBOX)` conditionals seem unnecessary. It seems like the only one actually needed is in `util/syscall_sandbox.cpp`\r\n- There should probably be a `TestDisallowedSandboxCall` or similar function in `syscall_sandbox.cpp` to avoid platform-specific code in `rpc/misc.cpp`\r\n- The `skip_if_bitcoind_syscall_sandbox()` function in the python framework would should probably be replaced by a `disable_syscall_sandbox()` function. It's nice how this PR changes the test framework to automatically pass `-sandbox=log-and-kill` to `bitcoind`. But for the tests that don't work with sandboxing, it would be better to just not pass the sandboxing option instead of skipping the test entirely.\r\n\r\nLight code review ACK and approach ACK 3131ec1fbb3db5d81502bcf349d20eb28ddb0ca4.",

Outside of the BPF filter construction, all the other build, test, config parsing and thread setup changes do look very good.\r\n\r\nChanges since last review: leaving sandboxing support in multiprocess build enabled (just disabling it specifically when needed at runtime), fixing handling of negated config options, adding many new explanatory comments and links in syscall_sandbox, adding new asserts, removing macro usages, tweaking BPF filter build code without changing the filter, adding python test --nosandbox option to be able to run tests without sandboxing.",

      "body": "Just curious, but merging this seems to have caused a few build problems that required followups: #23178 #23179 #23196, and I guess some test problems in local developer checkouts.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if there are any CI improvements that might have caught these problems. Are too many of the CI builds using old kernels, and could adding CI builds with newer kernels catch these problems? Are too many of the CI builds using depends and could adding CI builds with system dependencies catch these problems? Is there some extended draftbot build that might have caught these problems?\r\n\r\nIt seems like it could make sense to run some extended CI on PRs that modify `configure.ac` or build scripts, but not clear what might have been useful in this case.",

What would have helped find the problem is compiling with older kernel headers. We also should have done a GUIX build.\r\n\r\nIt's the first time these matter at all for our compilation. Besides `syscall(SYS_getrandom…` for random context gathering, there is no code that directly interfaces with the Linux kernel at all.\r\n\r\nI think it's a good lesson that we need to make sure to define everything we need from the kernel ourselves, to support compilation on a wide range of installations.

In fact, CI tasks with bleeding edge software might tend to break more often. (I do run them, but not part of this project).\r\n\r\n> Is there some extended draftbot build that might have caught these problems?\r\n\r\nSimply adding the \"DrahtBot Guix build requested\" label would have caught this. I think any pull request that is tagged with \"Build system\" should be Guix-built as well. As DrahtBot is running on limited resources, it might take a day or two to create the guix build, but I think this is an acceptable delay. If there is an \"emergency-fix\" devs can always do a local guix build.",

      "body": "Thanks for the replies. So is the answer to my question of what CI build would catch all these problems (#23178 #23179 #23196) that any CI build using newer kernel headers would catch all these problems? That all CI builds are using older headers and practicalswift was also using older headers, and this slipped past review?\r\n\r\nMy motivation for asking is just to understand when I am reviewing a PR what class of errors I could expect CI to catch, and what class of errors I should be testing manually or asking the PR author about. In this case, I guess I failed to ask practicalswift how is this code affected when new syscalls are added? And in the future, when I'm reviewing a PR that makes significant changes to the build system, I can request GUIX builds?\r\n\r\nI don't really have opinions on what CI should check for. I just want to understand what CI **is** checking for so I can review PRs better. For example, it is useful to know if CI is only checking old kernels and we are depending on developers to manually test newer kernels. It is also useful to know more generally if CI builds tend to use older or different dependencies than actual the GUIX release.",

Obviously Ubuntu/Debian ship different compilers than guix, so the CI is just a proxy and not a replacement for a guix build.\r\n\r\n",

Note that the attacker may be able to control the execution in the signal handler (although still with restricted syscall access), so this `SECCOMP_RET_TRAP` mode should really only be used when debugging.",

      "body": "@laanwj Now updated to default to debug mode as you suggested :)\r\n\r\nUpdated OP to describe the two modes of operation:\r\n* Debug mode (enabled via `configure` flag `--with-syscall-sandbox`): If a non-allowlisted syscall is called a debug handler will be invoked. Debug info will be printed (`ERROR: The syscall \"execve\" (syscall number 59) is not allowed by the syscall sandbox in thread \"msghand\". Please report. Exiting.`) and `std::terminate` is called. Note that the attacker may be able to control the execution in the signal handler (although still with restricted syscall access), so this mode should really only be used when debugging.\r\n* Kill without debug mode (enabled via `configure` flag `--with-syscall-sandbox=kill-without-debug`): If a non-allowlisted syscall is called the kernel will immediately kill the offending process.\r\n\r\n",

This way we can build and one distribute one binary with experimental sandbox support that can be disabled or enabled in different modes, instead of having to build multiple binaries with hardcoded sandbox modes.\r\n\r\nThere still would need to be a `--with-seccomp` option to be able to build on platforms without BPF, but the implementation and use of `--with-seccomp` should simpler than this option and not require complicating the build with system/boost process/multiprocess interactions.",

      "body": "The `DisableFurtherSyscallSandboxRestrictions` is (or rather: was) used to make any further/future `EnableSyscallSandbox` calls that be into no-ops.\r\n\r\nIn other words to \"lock\" the sandbox to the sandbox policy currently loaded. (Or disable the sandbox if no sandbox is loaded: in other words a call to `DisableFurtherSyscallSandboxRestrictions` without any preceding `EnableSyscallSandbox`.)\r\n\r\nThe quoted code above for example loads the `SyscallSandboxPolicy::INITIALIZATION` policy on `bitcoin-cli` startup and then locks that policy so that no matter what functions that `bitcoin-cli` may call that uses `EnableSyscallSandbox` we're guaranteed to run under `SyscallSandboxPolicy::INITIALIZATION`.\r\n\r\n`SyscallSandboxPolicy::INITIALIZATION` is the super-set of all sandbox policies in Bitcoin Core, so the code above basically says \"limit me to the syscall set we expect to be used in (any part of) Bitcoin Core, but make sure no further syscall sandbox restrictions are done in code I may call\" (in other words: ignore any upcoming `EnableSyscallSandbox` calls).\r\n\r\nThe above is how it used to be, and I agree that was a bit confusing, so I've now updated things:\r\n\r\nInstead of enabling the sandbox on first call to `void EnableSyscallSandbox(policy)`  I've now added a separate setup function `bool SetupSyscallSandbox(…)` (called at most once per binary) to enable the sandbox, and added a separate `void SetSyscallSandboxPolicy(policy)` to load a specific policy.\r\n\r\nIn other words the sandbox is opt-in via `bool SetupSyscallSandbox(…)`.\r\n\r\nA call to `SetupSyscallSandbox(…)` is made in `bitcoind` if `-sandbox=<mode>` is used.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm now limiting the syscall sandbox support to the `bitcoind` binary to keep things focused. I suggest we wait with the other binaries to keep things focused. We can gradually enable the sandbox for other binaries over time in future PR:s as we see fit when we've gained some experience with the experimental `bitcoind` syscall sandbox support. Sounds reasonable? :)",

      "body": "Great feedback. Thanks!\r\n\r\nI've now added a `-sandbox=<mode>` parameter. `--with-syscall-sandbox` has been renamed `--with-sandbox`.\r\n\r\nAvailable `-sandbox` modes are:\r\n* `-sandbox=disallow-and-log` (disallow unexpected syscalls and log the violation, then continue execution)\r\n* `-sandbox=log-and-kill` (log the violation and kill the process)\r\n* `-sandbox=kill` (kill the process immediately in case of a violation (without any logging))\r\n\r\nTo enable the syscall sandbox `--with-sandbox` is required at compile time _and_ `-sandbox=<mode>` needs to be specified at run time.\r\n\r\nThis dual opt-in approach is chosen since this is an experimental feature. We can consider relaxing this in the future when this feature has matured and has been extensively tested in many different environments. Note that `--with-sandbox=no` (no sandbox support) is intentionally the default.\r\n\r\n> There still would need to be a --with-seccomp option to be able to build on platforms without BPF, but the implementation and use of --with-seccomp should simpler than this option and not require complicating the build with system/boost process/multiprocess interactions.\r\n\r\nAdding `-sandbox=<mode>` allowed for a much simpler `--with-sandbox`, but note that the system/boost process/multiprocess interaction is still there and I'm not sure what the best approach would be if we were to get rid of it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAC_MSG_ERROR(The options --with-sandbox (which does not allow execve) and --enable-external-signer (which uses execve) are currently incompatible.)\r\n…\r\nAC_MSG_ERROR(The options --with-sandbox (which does not allow execve) and --enable-multiprocess (which uses execve) are currently incompatible.)\r\n…\r\nAC_DEFINE([HAVE_SYSTEM], [(HAVE_STD__SYSTEM || HAVE_WSYSTEM) && !USE_SYSCALL_SANDBOX], [std::system or ::wsystem, and no syscall sandbox])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIsn't say `--with-sandbox` (no `execve`) and `--enable-external-signer` (yes `execve`) mutually exclusive by design? :) \r\n\r\nOr is the suggestion to `InitError` if any \"`execve`/`HAVE_SYSTEM` depending\" option is passed to `bitcoind` when `-sandbox=<mode>` is used?\r\n\r\nAlso, note that `--with-sandbox` will make the functional test be run under the syscall sandbox (using `-sandbox=log-and-kill`). Thus if we allowed for say `--with-sandbox --enable-external-signer` then all external signer functional tests would need to be disabled, no?\r\n\r\nPlease advice :)",

Note however that continued normal execution cannot be _guaranteed_: the exact behaviour depends on the specific error handling at the syscall invocation call site. In some cases a failed syscall will be handled gracefully and in some places it won't. The \"may or may not continue execution\" part makes this mode potentially very confusing in practice so I think it makes sense to simply remove it for now.\r\n\r\nThe typo has been fixed. Thanks!",

The `echoipc` RPC method is the only IPC functionality that's merged so far, so it would be nice to make this change, but it could also be done later with #10102.\r\n",

FWIW I tried developing this feature without it first and that was... very cumbersome! :)\r\n\r\nI've now added a comment clarifying how `LINUX_SYSCALLS` (previously `SYSCALLS_LINUX_X86_64`) is used:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// This list of syscalls in LINUX_SYSCALLS is only used to map syscall numbers to syscall names in\r\n// order to be able to print user friendly error messages which include the syscall name in addition\r\n// to the syscall number.\r\n//\r\n// Example output in case of a syscall violation where the syscall is present in LINUX_SYSCALLS:\r\n//\r\n// ```\r\n// 2021-06-09T12:34:56Z ERROR: The syscall \"execve\" (syscall number 59) is not allowed by the syscall sandbox in thread \"msghand\". Please report.\r\n// ```\r\n//\r\n// Example output in case of a syscall violation where the syscall is not present in LINUX_SYSCALLS:\r\n//\r\n// ```\r\n// 2021-06-09T12:34:56Z ERROR: The syscall \"*unknown*\" (syscall number 314) is not allowed by the syscall sandbox in thread \"msghand\".

      "body": "OK, I get your point better now, it's not needed to replicate this entire structure for every architecture, because it doesn't have the raw numbers, it uses the `__NR_` constants.\r\n\r\nI agree it can be useful, it too bad querying a syscall name isn't a standard libc call, or outside that, a standard linux command that the error message can be run through. To add insult to injury, the syscall numbers are in a different file on every architecture, it's not like you can just grep `/usr/include/unistd.h` and be done with it.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that even now, new syscalls are often added to the Linux kernel. It seems really annoying to track this. But maybe it's not needed? How often do we use a new syscall.",
