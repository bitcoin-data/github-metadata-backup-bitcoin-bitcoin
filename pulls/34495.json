    "body": "This drops our dependency on `boost::signals2`, leaving `boost::multi_index` as the only remaining boost dependency for bitcoind.\r\n\r\n`boost::signals2` is a complex beast, but we only use a small portion of it. Namely: it's a way for multiple subscribers to connect to the same event, and the ability to later disconnect individual subscribers from that event.\r\n\r\n`btcsignals` adheres to the subset of the `boost::signals2` API that we currently use, and thus is a drop-in replacement. Rather than implementing a complex `slot` tracking class that we never used anyway (and which was much more useful in the days before std::function existed), callbacks are simply wrapped directly in `std::function`s.\r\n\r\nThe new tests work with either `boost::signals2` or the new `btcsignals` implementation. Reviewers can verify\r\nfunctional equivalency by running the tests in the commit that introduces them against `boost::signals2`, then again with `btcsignals`.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the commits in this PR are preparation and cleanup. Once `boost::signals2` is no longer needed, it is removed from depends. Additionally, a few CMake targets no longer need boost includes as they were previously only required for signals.\r\n\r\nI think this is actually pretty straightforward to review. I kept things simple, including keeping types unmovable/uncopyable where possible rather than trying to define those semantics. In doing so, the new implementation has even fewer type requirements than boost, which I believe is due to a boost bug. I've opened a PR upstream for that to attempt to maintain parity between the implementations.\r\n\r\nSee individual commits for more details.\r\n\r\nCloses #26442.",

Some can be fixed by adding\r\n```C++\r\n#include <boost/signals2/signal.hpp>\r\n```\r\nto */src/wallet/scriptpubkeyman.h*.\r\n\r\nBut after fixing that, ICE's show up together with more easily actionable issues:\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\hodlinator\\bitcoin\\src\\node\\interface_ui.cpp(28,18): fatal error C1001: Internal compiler error.

I'm not sure how it's even picking up `boost::signals2` references anymore. Is it possible something is stale in your environment? Whatever errors you're seeing _without_ including that header would be the interesting ones.\r\n\r\nBut don't poke too hard just yet. I realized last night that there's a behavioral break from boost in this branch, in that callbacks are not allowed to modify their `signal` or `connection`. If attempted, the callback will deadlock.\r\n\r\nI've updated the approach to match [boost's model](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/latest/doc/html/signals2/thread-safety.html) on this branch: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/tree/replace-signals-recursive . I'm just waiting to see how the c-i looks before force-pushing it here.\r\n\r\nApologies to anyone who's reviewed so far, hopefully nobody has looked into it too deeply. I've added some extra tests to demonstrate what would've deadlocked with the previous approach.",

      "body": "> I realized last night that there's a behavioral break from boost in this branch, in that callbacks are not allowed to modify their `signal` or `connection`. If attempted, the callback will deadlock.\r\n> \r\n> I've updated the approach to match [boost's model](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/latest/doc/html/signals2/thread-safety.html) on this branch: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/tree/replace-signals-recursive . I'm just waiting to see how the c-i looks before force-pushing it here.\r\n> \r\n> Apologies to anyone who's reviewed so far, hopefully nobody has looked into it too deeply. I've added some extra tests to demonstrate what would've deadlocked with the previous approach.\r\n\r\nPushed an updated impl of btcsignals which matches boost's callback threading model. Sorry for the noise.",
