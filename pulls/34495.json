    "body": "This drops our dependency on `boost::signals2`, leaving `boost::multi_index` as the only remaining boost dependency for bitcoind.\r\n\r\n`boost::signals2` is a complex beast, but we only use a small portion of it. Namely: it's a way for multiple subscribers to connect to the same event, and the ability to later disconnect individual subscribers from that event.\r\n\r\n`btcsignals` adheres to the subset of the `boost::signals2` API that we currently use, and thus is a drop-in replacement. Rather than implementing a complex `slot` tracking class that we never used anyway (and which was much more useful in the days before std::function existed), callbacks are simply wrapped directly in `std::function`s.\r\n\r\nThe new tests work with either `boost::signals2` or the new `btcsignals` implementation. Reviewers can verify\r\nfunctional equivalency by running the tests in the commit that introduces them against `boost::signals2`, then again with `btcsignals`.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the commits in this PR are preparation and cleanup. Once `boost::signals2` is no longer needed, it is removed from depends. Additionally, a few CMake targets no longer need boost includes as they were previously only required for signals.\r\n\r\nI think this is actually pretty straightforward to review. I kept things simple, including keeping types unmovable/uncopyable where possible rather than trying to define those semantics. In doing so, the new implementation has even fewer type requirements than boost, which I believe is due to a boost bug. I've opened a PR upstream for that to attempt to maintain parity between the implementations.\r\n\r\nSee individual commits for more details.",
