      "body": "@fanquake Thanks for communicating the rationale clearly. That brings transparency to your maintainer work.\r\n\r\nSince the maintainer role is a commission of trust I think it is crucial that the decision process is clear and that the maintainer is ready to bring clarity if needed by answering questions about his/her decisions.\r\n\r\nFWIW: I think you're doing a great job with labelling the PR:s. I'm continually impressed by how quickly you do the labelling. Talking about that, did you see [my curious question in #14239](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14239#issuecomment-425807696) on how to label PR:s fixing undefined behaviour (\"bugs\" vs \"refactoring\")? Not a big issues obviously but it would be nice to have it clarified. More communication is better than less communication when it comes to maintainership :-)\r\n\r\nThanks!",
