    "body": "Continuing the work in #20197 and #20685, this pull updates and abstracts our inbound eviction protection to make it fully ratio-based and easily extensible to peers connected via high-latency privacy networks that we newly support, like I2P and perhaps others soon, as these peers are disadvantaged by the latency criteria of our eviction logic.\r\n\r\nIt then adds eviction protection for peers connected over I2P.  As described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20685#issuecomment-767486499, we've observed over the past few months that I2P peers have a min ping latency similar to or greater than that of onion peers.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is a basically a multi-pass knapsack:\r\n\r\n- Count the number of eviction candidates in each of the disadvantaged\r\n  privacy networks.\r\n\r\n- Sort the networks from lower to higher candidate counts, so that\r\n  a network with fewer candidates will have the first opportunity\r\n  for any unused slots remaining from the previous iteration.  In\r\n  the case of a tie in candidate counts, priority is given by array\r\n  member order from first to last, guesstimated to favor more unusual\r\n  networks.\r\n\r\n- Iterate through the networks in this order.  On each iteration,\r\n  allocate each network an equal number of protected slots targeting\r\n  a total number of candidates to protect, provided any slots remain\r\n  in the knapsack.\r\n\r\n- Protect the candidates in that network having the longest uptime,\r\n  if any in that network are present.\r\n\r\n- Continue iterating as long as we have non-allocated slots\r\n  remaining and candidates available to protect.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this logic is to favorise the diversity of our peer connections.\r\n\r\nThe individual commit messages describe each change in more detail.\r\n\r\nSpecial thank you to Vasil Dimov for the excellent review feedback and the algorithm improvement that made this change much better than it would have been otherwise. Thanks also to Antoine Riard, whose review feedback nudged this change to protect disadvantaged networks having fewer, rather than more, eviction candidates.",

      "body": "The results make more sense when they depend on number of peers by network, e.g. if you have 10 I2P peers and 3 onion ones, best to give first chance at unused slots to the I2P peers so we protect, say, 3 I2P and 2 onions rather than the opposite.  Stable sort only makes a difference if the peer counts are equal. I'll propose this separately in the last commit for feedback.",

I am not sure. One may argue that protecting one more (but we are talking about just one here) from the rare network (onion) is better because it is easier to find peers from the more popular network (I2P), so the ones from the rare network are more scarce and precious. Or a counter argument could be to keep the proportion - if we have more I2P, then keep more I2P.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think it is not so important because it is just 1 peer we are talking about here and I would favor code simplicity over enforcing either approach with more complex code.",

The simplest code was when only a `Network` was passed around all the code without the `is_local` bool everywhere, but that simplicity had a logic encapsulation drawback (perhaps some others), so I rewrote everything and brought back `is_local`. \r\n\r\nI've redone this pull several times because I'd like it to do the right thing, whether networks with more peers get first priority at unused slots or networks with fewer.  When running a node with a reduced number of connections (`-maxconnections`), an eviction candidate can be one of a small number. If people prefer to have the array order decide independently of the number of peers, it seems we should clearly document that dependency. Edit: documented.\r\n\r\nI've separated the changes out to separate commits. Am going through everything before pushing the update.",

      "body": "Given that `num_protected` is incremented with a non-constant number, that could be larger than `1`, I assume it could become larger than `max_protect_by_network` at some point. Thus `>=` for comparison instead of `==`.\r\n\r\nHow could replacing `>=` with `==` and an assert change anything? I think if it changes anything then it must be a trigger of the assert - if it was equal before, then behavior is unchanged (`>=` is the same as `==`) and if it was strictly larger, before we would have executed `break;` and after the change - triggered the assert.\r\n\r\nTo me that assert looks scary, even if some (non-obvious) arithmetic a few lines above mandates it will never be triggered. The code may be altered in the future which may change this. Also, even if it happens that `num_protected > max_protect_by_network`, then nothing really bad has happened - we protected some peers (more than we intended), the program can continue executing just fine.\r\n\r\n_(the code at the time I write this does not contain an assert (a457f34e5039b75ee015b273028c3ee153656d5c))_",
