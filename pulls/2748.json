    "body": "Here is the first go at an Autotools build system replacement. It is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the current system(s), providing the same features with no net changes. It can also live side-by-side with the old system while sharing the same build-related variables in order to facilitate a smooth transition.\n\nI hope the benefits are obvious enough: A single/shared build procedure, portability, ease of packaging, ease for downstreams, ease for repository maintainers, cross-compilation, etc. I don't vouch for Autotools in any way, in fact, this configure.am is downright ugly (mainly just because of mingw though), but it's portable and well-established.\n\nI've opted not to write the documentation yet, because I would like to see what comments/concerns come out of the first round of review before committing to anything.\n\nThis does away with the need for qmake, as the Makefile is capable of generating everything it needs in a portable way.\n\nQt-creator can be used with the Autotools plugin, and is working nicely. For those who wish to use it this way, install the Autotools plugin from the 'about' menu, then open Makefile.am as a project. It handles the build procedure, so there is no need to mess with the command-line procedures listed below.\n\nBuilding from CLI:\nFor Linux, assuming the dependencies have been met, the build procedure looks like this:\n\n```\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake\n```\n\nSame for OS X, but the pkg-config path needs to be hooked up from macports first:\n\n```\necho \"/opt/local/share/aclocal\" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/aclocal/dirlist\n```\n\nFor mingw it's the same, but you will need to provide lots of paths in the form of:\n\n```\n./autogen.sh\nCPPFLAGS=\"-I/path/to/include -I/path/to/other/include\" LDFLAGS=\"-L/path/to/libs -L/path/to/other/libs\" ./configure\nmake\n```\n\nIn addition, there are helpers for qt and boost to help with finding some locations.\nUse ./configure --help to see the available options.\n\nNative windows built is untested, as I don't have a windows environment at my disposal.\n\nI have verified that linux builds are deterministic insofar as a fresh git clone will build bit-exact binaries to match another clean checkout on the same machine. To my knowledge, that means that gitian shouldn't have any trouble making the switch (after the descriptors are updated to use autotools).\n\n'make check' will run the unit tests and print the results.\n\nI've done my best to avoid adding any new behavior or features, and I would much prefer to aim for feature-parity before making any improvements.\n\nTODO:\n- Update gitian descriptors.\n- Add documentation to reflect comments here\n- Cosmetics\n",

For Win32, it\nwas assumed to be unavailable.\n\nThis commit flips the logic so that the unix build declares the feature. The\nHAVE_MSG_NOSIGNAL define will be (automatically detected and) set by autotools\nas well, so that both build methods will give the same results.\n\nThere should be no observable changes in functionality here.",

          "body": "I realize this introduction is a bit long, so if you don't feel like reading skip to the bullet points below under \"strategy\".\n\nThe codebase as it exists right now has a number of unnecessary dependencies which makes code modularization much more difficult. In particular, the satoshi client was built to handle all bitcoin-related tasks, but its value as a \"reference implementation\" lies primarily in doing verification and acting as a relay agent as these are the most essential tasks that participating nodes must perform to keeping the network in operation. Things like wallets, historical databases, mining, and notification agents could be written as entirely separate third-party applications without risk to the network's fundamental integrity.\n\nThe basic architecture of a bitcoin node is as follows:\n\nAt the core there exist fundamental bitcoin message structures, along with the code necessary for serialization/deserialization. These structures belong in their own source files with minimal dependencies so they can be reused for applications that needn't perform verification and relay - for instance, filtering and notification agents. Unfortunately, these core structures currently reside for the most part in main.h/main.cpp, one of the central problems this pull request attempts to fix.\n\nOn top of these core structures sits a network component that manages sockets, does peer discovery, and handles queueing and dispatching of messages. This component is clearly dependent on the core message structures but does not depend on the specific logic used to verify blocks and transactions nor to identify misbehaving peers nor sign transactions nor maintain a block chain database.\n\nThen we have a scripting engine, signature verification component, and a signing component. Historical database applications do not need signature verification/signing functionality at all.  Filtering messages and sending alerts generally does not even require a scripting engine and does fine with basic pattern matching.\n\nThe most critical high-level operations needed by a verification/relay node such as the satoshi client are transaction verification; block chain and memory pool management; and detection/management of misbehaving peers. These things are currently primarily implemented in main.h/main.cpp. These are indeed the main operations of the satoshi client - but the core low-level structures should not depend at all on this logic.\n\nThen there's the UI, but let's leave that aside for a moment.\n\nFinally there's init.h/init.cpp, which sets up the particular environment in which the satoshi client runs.\n\n<b>This branch takes the following strategy:</b>\n- Remove source file dependencies on main.h and init.h by only including necessary headers wherever possible.\n- If source files depend on definitions in main or init, either move the dependent portions into main/init or move the depended-upon portions into separate files.\n- If the dependent source files use global variables or functions that clearly belong in either main or init, copy the value over to a class member or a variable with file scope in the dependent source or expose a registration function to set a callback.\n- If moving a core class out of main is impossible because its methods depend on variables or functions defined in main, isolate the methods that depend on main and either move them to another class that _does_ belong in main or convert them into regular functions in main.\n\nIt is important that all modifications made in this branch are easy to review and to test. This branch does not encourage rewriting things from scratch - only moving them and rearranging them in easily identifiable chunks. Furthermore, the focus of the branch is not so much on coding style and style consistency - but on isolation of functional units and elimination of unnecessary dependencies.\n",

I wouldn't want to retain both the old and the new, and needing to maintain them both. So, as soon as this can be used to build on linux/linux-mingw/osx/win32, and the gitian builds work, I'm fine with merging. Perhaps @laanwj wants to retain the .pro file, but assuming the autotools plugin to Qt Creator is powerful enough, I'd rather get rid of it.\n",

In the meantime, though, @warren has helped me to get the gitian descriptors up and running for win32, and linux should be easy after that.\n\nI've gotten the same vibe from the others, so I'll finish up with the impression that back-compat is not needed. Also, @laanwj said he is ok with figuring out some solution for himself for the .pro file, so I'll not concern myself with that either.\n",
