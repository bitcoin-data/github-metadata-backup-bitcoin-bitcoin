A negative `nTime` from the peer means he pretends that his time is pre-1970 and we just skew that to Jan 1 1970, replacing one garbage with another garbage. Then we [feed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b829894f84839dfd581ec52383f93baa32ee2710/src/net_processing.cpp#L2651-L2653) that garbage to `AddTimeData()` which only consumes the first [200](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b829894f84839dfd581ec52383f93baa32ee2710/src/timedata.cpp#L39) samples and ignores all calls afterwards :raised_eyebrow:.\r\n\r\nSo, it makes sense to avoid calling `AddTimeData()` with input we know for sure is garbage. What about something like the following?\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n        if (nTime > 1609459200 /* Fri Jan  1 00:00:00 UTC 2021 */) {\r\n            int64_t nTimeOffset = nTime - GetTime();\r\n            pfrom.nTimeOffset = nTimeOffset;\r\n            AddTimeData(pfrom.addr, nTimeOffset);\r\n        } else {\r\n            // Ignore garbage time.\r\n            pfrom.nTimeOffset = 0;\r\n        }\r\n```",
