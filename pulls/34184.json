    "body": "_This PR makes a breaking change to the Mining interface._\r\n\r\nAs reported in #33994, connected mining clients will receive a flood of new templates if the node is still going through IBD or catching up on the last 24 hours. This PR fixes that using an _optional_ cooldown mechanism, only applied to `createNewBlock()`.\r\n\r\nFirst, cooldown waits for IBD. Then, as the tip keeps moving forward, it waits a few seconds to see if the tip updated. If so, it restarts the timer and waits again. The trade-offs for this mechanism are explained below.\r\n\r\nBecause this PR changes `createNewBlock()` from a method that returns quickly to one that can block for minutes, the first commit fixes a bug in our `.capnp` definition, adding the missing `context` to `createNewBlock` (and `checkBlock`). It's an improved version of #33936.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking API change, so it bumps the `makeMining` version and throws a nice error for older clients. That's tested in the functional test, and I also saw it with the sv2 Rust client. It may be possible to instead work around the existing bug and avoid the breaking change, but I don't think that's worth the efort and potential confusion at this point.\r\n\r\nThe second commit introduces the actual cooldown mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe third then adds an `interrupt()` method so that clients can cleanly disconnect.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThe cooldown argument is optional, and not used by internal non-IPC code, for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The mechanism wreaks havoc on the functional test suite, which would require very careful mock time handling to work around. But that's pointless, because only IPC clients need it.\r\n2. It needs to be optional for IPC clients too, because in some situations, like a signet with only one miner, waiting for IBD can mean being stuck forever.\r\n\r\nThe reason it's only applied to `createNewBlock()` is that this is the first method called by clients; `waitNext()` is a method on the interface returned by `createNewBlock()`, at which point the cooldown is done.\r\n\r\nAfter IBD, we wait N seconds if the header is N blocks ahead of the tip, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 20 seconds. The minimum waiting time is short enough that it shouldn't be annoying or confusing for someone manually starting up a client. While the maximum should be harmless if it happens spuriously (which it shouldn't).\r\n\r\nIf the minimum wait is too short, clients get a burst of templates, as observed in the original issue. We can't entirely rule this out without a lot of additional complexity (like scanning our own log file for heuristics). This PR should make it a lot less likely, and thanks to the IBD wait also limit it to one day worth of blocks (`-maxtipage`).\r\n\r\nSome test runs on an M4 MacBook Pro, where I had a node catch up on the last few days worth of blocks:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"872\" height=\"972\" alt=\"Scherm­afbeelding 2026-02-04 om 18 21 17\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7902a0f2-0e0b-4604-9688-cec2da073261\" />\r\n\r\nAs the chart shows, sometimes it takes longer than 3 seconds. But it turns out that in all those cases there were quite a few headers ahead of the tip. It also demonstrates that it's important to first wait for IBD, because it's less likely a random tip update takes longer than 20 seconds.\r\n\r\n- modified sv2-apps: https://github.com/Sjors/sv2-apps/tree/2026/02/cooldown\r\n- test script: https://gist.github.com/Sjors/feb6122c97acc2b9e6d66b168614609c#file-run_mainnet_pool_loop-zsh\r\n- chart script: https://gist.github.com/Sjors/feb6122c97acc2b9e6d66b168614609c#file-tip_interval_charts-py",

This probably doesn't matter in real life, but it does in tests. E.g. the assume_utxo test \"Check importing a snapshot where current chain-tip is not an ancestor of the snapshot block but has less work\" creates an alternative chain of blocks despite having better headers (but not their blocks). In real life this implies a giant block witholding attack.",

This seems like probably the simplest change that can resolve #33994.\n\nI guess I have two lingering concerns about it:\n\n- This can cause the createNewBlock function to block for potentially a very long time when it didn't before and createNewBlock doesn't currently have any cancellation option other than shutting down the node. So it could make it hard for IPC clients to disconnect cleanly, and I suspect we may want to follow up here by adding some timeout or cancellation mechanism.\n\n- I'm not very sure about effectiveness of the cooldown strategy, and wouldn't be surprised if there were cases where it didn't work well but it does seem like a good starting point, and pretty conservative.",

I'm concerned about the new `MinerImpl::m_interrupt` variable, however, since I can see it leading to segfaults if clients destroy the `Mining` interface too early (even if they don't call the `interrupt` method). So I suggested moving the variable to the `KernelNotications` class to avoid this.",

      "body": "From the logs it looks like `waitNext` calls are churning, not `createNewBlock` calls, so just adding the cooldown delay to `createNewBlock` does not help.\r\n\r\nA possible fix might be to add an additional delay to `createNewBlock` so it waits to be connected to peers before returning, although this could also be fragile.\r\n\r\nAnother fix might be to add the 1 block/second cooldown delay to `waitNext` as well. This seems like it should be ok although there might be a bigger risk `waitNext` blocking when it shouldn't. Maybe adjusting the cooldown to delay to block if 2 blocks were connected in last second instead of 1 block (or something like that) might be safer if adding the cooldown to `waitNext`",

      "body": "I was thinking of just increasing the cooldown. As long as it's only on `createNewBlock()` that seems safe.\r\n\r\nFrom my own testing with syncing testnet4 from sratch on an M4 Apple Silicon machine, gaps of 1 second are common. Once I switched to a 3 second cool down, the pool behaved.\r\n\r\nI also tried the 3 second cool down while syncing a mainnet node, but 3 seconds isn't long enough on my machine. Just picking a bigger number would be annoying in the normal case.\r\n\r\nI tried a slightly fancier heuristic: cooldown is extended by the number of blocks remaining in seconds, capped at 20. \r\n\r\nCombined with also gating behind `IsInitialBlockDownload()` (which considers `-maxtipage`) it should work most of the time. In particular this deals with the (fairly common) situation where the node doesn't get any headers / blocks from its peers for a minute or so after startup. Just checking for connections isn't enough.\r\n\r\nWill push some code later.\r\n\r\n#29565 would be quite handy for testing this.\r\n\r\n(the experiment caused the node to segfault as I triggered unclean pool shutdowns with `timeout`, I believe that's a known issue being worked on)",

      "body": "Alright, I made some changes...\r\n\r\nFirst, I added a commit to pass missing `context` to `createNewBlock` (and `checkBlock`). This is a breaking API change, so it bumps the `makeMining` version and throws a nice error for older clients. That's tested in the functional test, and I also saw it with the sv2 Rust client. At this point, at least with the change in this PR, I don't think it's worth trying to work around this bug, as it's confusing at best.\r\n\r\nNext, I made `cooldown` an optional argument. This is because the mechanism ended up breaking the functional test suite, especially waiting for IBD. And in some situations, like a signet with only one miner, waiting for IBD could mean being stuck forever.\r\n\r\nSo cooldown waits for IBD and then as the tip keeps moving forward, it waits a bit to see if new blocks come in. But how long to wait?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"850\" height=\"720\" alt=\"Scherm­afbeelding 2026-02-04 om 17 23 51\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de695e11-1384-4984-8a41-b48b063f4389\" />\r\n\r\nI decided on a minimum of 3 seconds. That short enough that it's not going to annoy someone who manually starts up a client. And at least on my M4 MacBook Pro on mainnet, it works. I'll share some (not pretty) code to test this later.\r\n\r\nAs the chart shows, sometimes it takes longer than 3 seconds. But it turns out that in all those cases there were quite a few headers ahead of the tip. So the cooldown mechanism has another heuristic: wait N seconds if the header is N blocks ahead of the tip, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 20.\r\n\r\nI'm sure we could tweak this numbers further and have the node analyse it's own log files for perfection, but ultimately it's just an educated guess. If we wait too long, it's slightly annoying, but 3 - 20 seconds isn't terrible. If we wait too short, clients get a burst of templates. That can lead to others issues, but I guess in the worst case they can just restart, reconnect and try again a minute later. The code itself seems acceptably simple.",

Since last review, `createNewBlock` was fixed (by adding context parameter) to be actually interruptible, and cooldown was made optional and off by default, wait for `chainman().IsInitialBlockDownload()` was added, and `CooldownIfHeadersAhead` internal logic was improved to wait longer when there are more blocks waiting to be connected, instead of returning as soon as more than 1 second elapses between connecting blocks.\n\nAll of these changes seem very nice. I left suggestions for keeping backwards compatibility and fixing a missing lock with I think would be good to apply but probably not critical.",

Not sure if it would be possible to add a `GUARDED_BY` annotation but that could be nice.\n\nMore importantly, we may want to consider moving this variable somewhere else. A side-effect of adding the variable here is that it makes the MinerImpl class have state, which can be bad because now destroying the `Mining` object while `createNewBlock` or `waitNext` calls are in progress can cause segfaults. This could cause the node to crash with existing IPC clients if they destroy `Mining` objects early, or if they just disconnect during a `waitNext` call and the `Mining` object is garbage collected before it returns.\n\nFor these reasons I think it might be good to move the `MinerImpl::m_interrupt` variable somewhere else like `KernelNotifications::m_blocktemplate_request_interrupted`. This would be hackier than the current solution but I think worth it to avoid node crashes triggered by IPC.\n\n(In the longer term a better solution would be to provide an `interfaces::Interrupt` type that could be passed to `waitNext` and `createBlockTemplate` methods as additional method argument. These methods could then attach a `std::function<void()>` lambda to run whatever code they need when an interrupt is triggered. Clients would then have the ability to cancel individual calls by triggering the `Interrupt` object. Internally, the cancellation could be implemented either by making a separate RPC call or by using Cap'n Proto's native `allowCancellation` mechanism.)\n\n\n",

Does it have a similar issue?\r\n\r\nYou are right, I misremembered the way `interruptWait` was implemented and it does follow a similar pattern, and the issue is not as bad as I thought.\r\n\r\nThe issue is actually pretty hard to trigger because the Cap'n Proto's internal reference counting keeps the `BlockTemplate` object alive by default until the `waitNext` call returns. So a client would have to explicitly call destroy on the `BlockTemplate` object in that case or the `Mining` object in this case for there to be a crash.\r\n\r\nSo I think the current implementation of this is ok and unlikely to lead to any accidental crashes.\r\n\r\nI did go ahead and implement my suggestion before realizing the problem was not so bad, so will paste it here for reference, but your current solution seems cleaner and I'd recommend keeping it.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>diff</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/node/interfaces.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/node/interfaces.cpp\r\n@@ -929,7 +929,7 @@ public:\r\n \r\n     void interruptWait() override\r\n     {\r\n-        InterruptWait(notifications(), m_interrupt_wait);\r\n+        InterruptWait(notifications(), &m_interrupt_wait);\r\n     }\r\n \r\n     const BlockAssembler::Options m_assemble_options;\r\n@@ -964,7 +964,7 @@ public:\r\n \r\n     std::optional<BlockRef> waitTipChanged(uint256 current_tip, MillisecondsDouble timeout) override\r\n     {\r\n-        return WaitTipChanged(chainman(), notifications(), current_tip, timeout, m_interrupt);\r\n+        return WaitTipChanged(chainman(), notifications(), current_tip, timeout);\r\n     }\r\n \r\n     std::unique_ptr<BlockTemplate> createNewBlock(const BlockCreateOptions& options) override\r\n@@ -976,7 +976,7 @@ public:\r\n         // Avoid generating a new template immediately after connecting a block while\r\n         // our best known header chain still has more work.
