    "body": "Builds upon pull #1271, which fixes Issue #1234.\n\nThis allows multiple peers to provide blocks, not just one. Up to 8 peers can provide blocks in parallel, thereby increasing block download speed by up to 8.\n\nSubmitted for comments. I think ideally I'll add some more code to cater for stuck downloads, so it can give up and move onto another peer. Currently, it'll only move onto another peer if the selected peer disconnects. It a peer took a long time to disconnect, then all blocks downloaded would be orphans until the missing block was eventually downloaded.\n\nAlso, the \"8\" concurrent downloads is hard-coded, would people prefer this to be a configurable command-line option?\n",

      "body": "I've closed this pull for now, as it was opened for comments, but it's not ready to pull. It still needs: 1) stuck management, and 2a) either a separate AskFor function for txs and blocks, as as it's currently written, it'll getdata the same tx from many nodes at the same time, or 2b) the same treatment of txs, i.e. don't download the same tx from another peer.\n\n2b isn't so ideal as it will produce more getdatas as with the way it's written, it'll only have 1 inv per every getdata. This is ok for blocks (IMHO), but perhaps not so suitable for txs, so I'd be inclined to go with 2a rather than 2b.\n\nFeedback much appreciated.\n\n@gmaxwell, re your last comment, no worries, it's not finished anyway, so perhaps it's better to wait until I've completed bits 1 and 2a first - although your comments on whether 2a or 2b or 3c (something else) are suitable would be welcome.\n\nRe CaughtUp() not being reliable. Well, true, but if one is connected to misbehaving peers such as this, then one'd (!) probably not want to be downloading from them anyway. The reason I created CaughtUp() is so that it can be refined to be more reliable. It serves a different purpose to IsInitialDownload() from what I've been told by others that that function is for. I do think CaughtUp(), based on your comments above, does need refining given the risk you mention. Perhaps it can factor in the timestamp of the last block received also as a sanity check.\n",
