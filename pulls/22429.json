    "body": "This PR fixes wrong uses of the term \"witness program\", which according to [BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#Witness_program)  is defined as follows:\r\n> A scriptPubKey (or redeemScript as defined in BIP16/P2SH) that consists of a 1-byte push opcode (for 0 to 16) followed by a data push between 2 and 40 bytes gets a new special meaning. The value of the first push is called the \"version byte\". **The following byte vector pushed is called the \"witness program\".**\r\n\r\nIn most cases where \"witness program\" is used in tests (concerns comments, variable names and in one instance even a function name) what we really want to denote is the \"witness script\". Thanks to [MarcoFalke for pointing this out in a review comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22363#discussion_r666794261)!\r\n\r\nSome historical background: At the time when the P2P segwit tests were first introduced (commit 330b0f31ee5719d94f9e52dfc83c5d82168241f9, PR #8149), the term \"witness program\" was not used consistently in BIP141: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/46451/what-is-the-precise-definition-of-witness-program\r\nThis was fixed in PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/416 later.\r\n\r\nSo in some way, this PR can be seen as a very late follow-up to the BIP141 fix that also reflects these changes in the tests.",
