    "body": "This PR fixes wrong uses of the term \"witness program\", which according to [BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#Witness_program)  is defined as follows:\r\n> A scriptPubKey (or redeemScript as defined in BIP16/P2SH) that consists of a 1-byte push opcode (for 0 to 16) followed by a data push between 2 and 40 bytes gets a new special meaning. The value of the first push is called the \"version byte\". **The following byte vector pushed is called the \"witness program\".**\r\n\r\nIn most cases where \"witness program\" is used in tests (concerns comments, variable names and in one instance even a function name) what we really want to denote is the \"witness script\". Thanks to [MarcoFalke for pointing this out in a review comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22363#discussion_r666794261)!\r\n\r\nSome historical background: At the time when the P2P segwit tests were first introduced (commit 330b0f31ee5719d94f9e52dfc83c5d82168241f9, PR #8149), the term \"witness program\" was not used consistently in BIP141: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/46451/what-is-the-precise-definition-of-witness-program\r\nThis was fixed in PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/416 later.\r\n\r\nSo in some way, this PR can be seen as a very late follow-up to the BIP141 fix that also reflects these changes in the tests.",

          "body": "PR #18788 (commit 08067aebfd7e838e6ce6b030c31a69422260fc6f) introduced functions to generate output scripts for various types. This PR replaces all manual CScript creations in the P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH formats with those helpers in order to increase readability and maintainability over the functional test codebase. The first commit fixes a bug in the wallet_util helper module w.r.t. to P2SH-P2WSH script creation (the result is not used in any test so far, hence it can still be seen as refactoring).\r\n\r\nThe following table shows a summary of the output script patterns tackled in this PR:\r\n\r\n| Type | master branch  | PR branch |\r\n| ---------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| P2PKH | `CScript([OP_DUP, OP_HASH160, hash160(key), OP_EQUALVERIFY, OP_CHECKSIG])` | `key_to_p2pkh_script(key)`  |\r\n|             | `CScript([OP_DUP, OP_HASH160, keyhash, OP_EQUALVERIFY, OP_CHECKSIG])` | `keyhash_to_p2pkh_script(keyhash)` |\r\n| P2SH  | `CScript([OP_HASH160, hash160(script), OP_EQUAL])`  | `script_to_p2sh_script(script)` |\r\n| P2WPKH | `CScript([OP_0, hash160(key)])` | `key_to_p2wpkh_script(key)` |\r\n| P2WSH | `CScript([OP_0, sha256(script)])` | `script_to_p2wsh_script(script)` |\r\n\r\nNote that the `key_to_...` helpers can't be used if an invalid key size (not 33 or 65 bytes) is passed, which is the case in some rare instances where the scripts still have to be created manually.\r\n\r\nPossible follow-up ideas:\r\n* further simplify by identifying P2SH-wrapped scripts and using `key_to_p2sh_p2wpkh_script()` and `script_to_p2sh_p2wsh_script()` helpers\r\n* introduce and use `key_to_p2pk_script()` helper for P2PK scripts",
