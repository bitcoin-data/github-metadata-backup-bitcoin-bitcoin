    "body": "This patch adds a \"redundant\" rule with the annex discouragement, to discourage Annexes that are present but do not get signed.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not include tests, as the code paths are entirely redundant (and small!) with existing annex discouragement. If desired, tests could be made.\r\n\r\nThis new policy would come into play if someone somewhere for some reason decided that they were going to modify standard policy on their node to allow annexes **even though it is abundantly clear that annex policy should not change until there is a semantic meaning for them** (see the Taproot BIPs for more context), they can leave this lighter policy intact (or add it as a backport if they have already started accepting annexes).\r\n\r\nGiven recent discussion, it seems clear that certain nodes will remove such limitations, and having this code present in core provides an encouragement to retain this safety oriented policy, even if Annexes are desired prematurely.\r\n\r\nAnnexes should be signed because if they are not, certain output types (e.g. and OP_TRUE script in a taproot output, used only as an anchor) would become malleable to third parties, introducing griefing and transaction pinning vectors. If the annexes will come anyways, they must at least be specifically requested under this rule.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b072ffa-2fe3-4345-9e9c-5486d78d1c77)\r\n",

If so, make sure to rebase on the latest\ncommit of the target branch.\n\n* A sanitizer issue, which can only be found by compiling with the sanitizer and running the\n  affected test.\n\n* An intermittent issue.\n\nLeave a comment here, if you need help tracking down a confusing failure.\n\n</details>\n\n",
