    "body": "The current code makes it hard to call functions for checking the consensus-correctness of a block without having a full UTXO set at hand. This makes implementing features such as Utreexo and non-assumevalid swiftsync, where maintaining a full UTXO set defeats their purpose, through the kernel API difficult. Checks like the coinbase subsidy, or block sigops are only available through `ConnectBlock`, which requires a complete coins cache.\r\n\r\nSolve this by moving accessing coins and the responsibility of spending them out of `ConnectBlock` and into a new separate function called `SpendBlock`. Pass a block's spent coins through the existing `CBlockUndo` data structure to `ConnectBlock`. \r\n\r\nWhile the change is largely a refactor, some smaller behaviour changes were unavoidable. These should be highlighted in the commit messages. The last commit contains the most important part of the coins logic move, the commits before attempt to prepare it piecemeal.\r\n\r\nThis pull request was benchmarked on [benchcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/benchcoin/pull/162), which showed no performance regression. While discussing this pull request it was noted that pre-fetching and eliminating the need for some additional map lookups might improve performance a bit, but this does not make a measurable difference in the grand scheme of things and was not the motivation for this pull request.\r\n\r\nIn future changes, ConnectBlock could be made even more self contained, accessing the coins from the internal map could be further optimized by consolidating existence checking and spending, and the function eventually exposed in an external kernel API (as done [here](https://github.com/sedited/bitcoin/commit/09e05493010119fc60d310d3e7ffc388de441f9a#diff-f638e65d9278276b2a6ac42ffbbd26d079c3dba752feed5038a25a1ee565d320R947))",

      "body": "> Pass a block's spent coins through the existing `CBlockUndo` data structure to `ConnectBlock`\r\n\r\nI don't think this is really a good direction. We already have a generic interface for supplying info about unspent coins: `CCoinsView`; I think we should be using that, rather than requiring users to convert their utxo data store into our undo format?\r\n\r\nThe thing that gets in the way of that seems to be the `AccessCoin` function returning a `Coin` by reference rather than value, but that doesn't seem particularly more efficient (it's an 8 byte copy rather than a 56 byte one unless the coin being spent is very non-standard, at least since #32279), and also seems a bit risky (in that the return value's lifetime is dependent on when the cache gets invalidated which is somewhat unpredictable).\r\n\r\nBut that seems to be fixable: https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/202509-ccoinsview/\r\n\r\n(When AccessCoin was introduced in #1677, CScript always involved an additional heap allocation as it was just a `vector<char>`, so the reference would have saved an allocation. That changed a few years later when prevector was introduced in #6914 which allowed small scripts to not require an allocation. However, I haven't actually checked to see if the 8-vs-56-byte issue is actually as trivial as I think it should be)",

Potential clients of the kernel are often capable of supplying the coins in order as consumed by a transaction's inputs. Requiring these to be stored in a map seems wrong. I.e. if a utreexo client has all the leaf data to go with a transaction, it should not have to use a less efficient data structure that consumes more memory to pass in the coins. But maybe we have to build out some of the usages here in order to see what the actual drawbacks are? My current thinking is though that just passing in the required coins contiguously, i.e. use the undo data structure, is the more pragmatic solution for most external users that do not wish to implement a utxo set. \r\n\r\nHowever this is also not exactly what I think you are suggesting here, since the `CCoinsView` could eventually provide a view over contiguous data too. As implemented at the moment, that seems more confusing to use though compared to a nested vector of coins.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative solution that was suggested by cfields is introducing a new transaction type that holds the coins alongside the prevouts. I think that would be an interesting alternative too.",

Potential clients of the kernel are often capable of supplying the coins in order as consumed by a transaction's inputs.\r\n\r\nI think that's a false optimisation for two reasons: first, is that the primary client of the bitcoin core kernel is the bitcoin core node software, we should be designing for that case, not for other hypothetical clients; second, looking up a map isn't very expensive in comparison to the other parts of block validation, particular signature validation. So if we already know the exact utxos spent in a block, converting just those utxos into a CCoinsView and using that seems likely to be within the margin of error for any benchmarks on realistic blocks. If we were designing this from scratch for a utreexo-based system, then yeah, the undo-centric approach would make sense (and including the prevouts inside the transaction makes a lot of sense then), but that's not the primary use case here (at least not yet).\r\n\r\nI think constructing a CCoinsView from a block and undo would look something like this (on top of the previous changes I suggested above, untested):\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nclass BlockUndoCoinsView : public CCoinsView\r\n{\r\nprivate:\r\n    struct CoinCmp\r\n    {\r\n        bool operator()(const COutPoint* l, const COutPoint* r) const {\r\n            if (l && r) return *l < *r;\r\n            return r != nullptr;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    std::map<const COutPoint*, const Coin*, CoinCmp> m_coins;\r\n\r\npublic:\r\n    explicit BlockUndoCoinsView(const CBlock& block, const CBlockUndo& undo)\r\n    {\r\n        size_t i = 0;\r\n        for (const auto& txundo : undo.vtxundo) {\r\n            ++i; // skip the coinbase tx\r\n            if (i >= block.vtx.size()) break;\r\n            size_t j = 0;\r\n            const auto& tx = block.vtx[i];\r\n            for (const auto& prevout : txundo.vprevout) {\r\n                if (j >= tx->vin.size()) break;\r\n                const auto& outpoint = tx->vin[j].prevout;\r\n                // XXX skip coins whose txid was from a previous tx in this block? \r\n                m_coins.try_emplace(&outpoint, &prevout);\r\n                ++j;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    std::optional<Coin> GetCoin(const COutPoint& outpoint) const override\r\n    {\r\n        auto coin = m_coins.find(&outpoint);\r\n        if (coin == m_coins.end()) return std::nullopt;\r\n        return *coin->second;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    bool HaveCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint) const override\r\n    {\r\n        return m_coins.find(&outpoint) != m_coins.end();\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess what I mean is I think we can achieve the stated goal of this PR (being able to validate blocks/txs without the full utxo set) with a smaller change.\r\n\r\nIf returning a `const Coin&` rather than a copy is needed for performance, it might be better to do that through an RAII cursor object that guarantees the reference remains valid until the cursor is destroyed.",

The side effect of that is that the `CBlockUndo` is populated outside of `ConnectBlock` too and has to be passed in. Since it already holds all the required coins, I rather took those coins vectors, than additionally requiring a view providing the same data (next to the reasons I provided in my comment above).\r\n\r\nThe change was motivated by wanting to provide a single method for validating a block with external coins, such that others can use it verbatim in the near future. The alternative of just changing some of the functions that `ConnectBlock` calls to be able to accept external coins (through either a view or contiguous data), and then splitting the rest of the `ConnectBlock` logic, such as amount, locktime, assumevalid, and validity semantics into separate functions seemed inferior to me. If an external user would want to use these functions to achieve the same outcome, a single function not only seems friendlier, but also less likely to result in bugs.\r\n\r\nI could change this patch set to pass in a `CCoinsView` and then either handle the undo data outside of `ConnectBlock`, or populate it through the view within `ConnectBlock`.\r\n\r\n",

The checks you mention are skipped in any case, because we check `if (!state.IsValid()) break;`, but similarly the coinbase check won't override the validation result if it is already invalid.

BIP30 separately, while the remaining validation functions would simply get passed the block undo data and operate as stateless validation functions.\n\n",

Initially, I thought it should be the caller’s responsibility to decide whether `bip30validate` is called, rather than mandating it here.\r\n\r\nMy motivation for separating `SpendBlock` from `BIP30Validate` is discussed in:\r\nhttps://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-apps/issues/120\r\n\r\nThe branch without the last commit would make it easier to implement a variant of the idea described in https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-apps/issues/120, where  block validation for this JDS is as follows call `SpendBlock` and then `ConnectBlock` skip BIP30. However, the idea of skipping consensus checks is not acceptable.\r\n\r\nGiven that, I’m inclined to keep this as-is.\r\nFor https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-apps/issues/120, we can instead expose IPC methods: `SpendBlock`, which takes a block and returns the coins, and `ValidateBlock`, which performs the full block validation checks. Since blocks from miners tend to share many transactions, they can still benefit from this approach, because the JDS needs to only call `SpendBlock` to validate newly seen transactions.\r\n\r\nFor Utreexo client, they provide their own undo data and cannot perform BIP30 validation anyway, so they benefit from this approach as well.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is still an improvement over the current status quo.\r\n",
