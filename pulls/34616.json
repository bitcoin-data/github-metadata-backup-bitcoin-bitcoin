    "body": "Part of #30289, replaces earlier #34138.\r\n\r\nThis introduces a more accurate cost model for SFL, to control how much CPU time is spent inside the algorithm for clusters that cannot be linearized perfectly within a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nThe goal is having a metric for the amount of work performed, so that txmempool can impose limits on that work: a lower bound that is always performed (unless optimality is reached before that point, of course), and an upper bound to limit the latency and total CPU time spent on this. There are conflicting design goals here:\r\n* On the one hand, it seems ideal if this metric is closely correlated to actual CPU time, because otherwise the limits become inaccurate.\r\n* On the other hand, it seems a nightmare to have the metric be platform/system dependent, as it makes network-wide reasoning nearly impossible. It's expected that slower systems take longer to do the same thing; this holds for everything, and we don't need to compensate for this.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple solutions to this:\r\n* One extreme is just measuring the time. This is very accurate, but extremely platform dependent, and also non-deterministic due to random scheduling/cache effects.\r\n* The other extreme is using a very abstract metric like counting how many times certain loops/function inside the algorithm run. That is what is implemented in master right now, just counting the sum of the numbers of transactions updated across all `UpdateChunks()` calls. It however necessarily fails to account for significant portions of runtime spent elsewhere, resulting in a rather wide range of \"ns per cost\" values.\r\n* This PR takes a middle ground, counting many function calls / branches / loops, with weights that were determined through benchmarking on an average on a number of systems.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the cost model was obtained by:\r\n* For a variety of machines:\r\n  * Running a fixed collection of ~385000 clusters found through random generation and fuzzing, optimizing for difficulty of linearization.\r\n    * Linearize each ~3000 times, with different random seeds. Sometimes without input linearization, sometimes with a bad one.\r\n      * Gather cycle counts for each of the operations included in this cost model, broken down by their parameters.\r\n  * Correct the data by subtracting the runtime of obtaining the cycle count.\r\n  * Drop the 5% top and bottom samples from each cycle count dataset, and compute the average of the remaining samples.\r\n  * For each operation, fit a least-squares linear function approximation through the samples.\r\n* Rescale all machine expressions to make their total time match, as we only care about relative cost of each operation.\r\n* Take the per-operation average of operation expressions across all machines, to construct expressions for an average machine.\r\n* Approximate the result with integer coefficients.\r\n\r\nThe benchmarks were performed by `l0rinc <pap.lorinc@gmail.com>` and myself, on AMD Ryzen 5950X, AMD Ryzen 7995WX, AMD Ryzen 9980X, Apple M4 Max, Intel Core i5-12500H, Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, Intel N150 (Umbrel), Intel Core i7-7700, Intel Core i9-9900K, Intel Haswell (VPS, virtualized), ARM Cortex-A76 (Raspberry Pi 5).\r\n\r\nBased on final benchmarking, the \"acceptable\" iteration count (which is the minimum spent on every cluster) is to 64000 units, which corresponds to roughly 50 μs on Ryzen 5950X and similar modern desktop hardware.",

      "body": "Running this branch on all clusters seen in a simulated replay of 2023 mempool data, I get the following maximum costs (from 1 to 64 transaction clusters, inclusive): 148, 413, 717, 1196, 1505, 2413, 2222, 2772, 3357, 3847, 4899, 5557, 6461, 7431, 8507, 9144, 10737, 12169, 13691, 14034, 16550, 18539, 19804, 21090, 22750, 24219, 25492, 27941, 26319, 28270, 26858, 26835, 30743, 32388, 34586, 33729, 32543, 34478, 23431, 36431, 39179, 25413, 34125, 29534, 30974, 34904, 45576, 68614, 35684, 31717, 37144, 34917, 36022, 43473, 50659, 41848, 48538, 64825, 43945, 49389, 45978, 45961, 46946, 52467.\r\n\r\nSame number for recent dumps from oct 2025 - yesterday (not simulated replay): 148, 413, 717, 1176, 1616, 2430, 3000, 3624, 3944, 4764, 4800, 6147, 9162, 11460, 8832, 11347, 9785, 12437, 13388, 14681, 12882, 19168, 16532, 23370, 22523, 19992, 14850, 19338, 26696, 23344, 15424, 23684, 30767, 24648, 25410, 27899, 20638, 25316, 24522, 26477, 24069, 34044, 24520, 40842, 22827, 29580, 27610, 25332, 26773, 30432, 30786, 36058, 37928, 37084, 35088, 40434, 39613, 40156, 42154, 49497, 42668, 55243, 39423, 55692.\r\n\r\nSo almost all sizes (all except ntx=58 and ntx=48 in 2023, all recent ones) saw no clusters that would need more than the acceptable level of 64000 cost. These numbers are created by running every cluster 100 times, with 100 difference RNG seeds, and with \"worst case\" input linearizations (including random ones, worst-possible inputs, or no input). In practice, I expect that most large clusters will be built up gradually, so will be passed a nearly-perfect input linearization, yielding better numbers than these. Also note that linearization efforts perform up to 5 times the acceptable level (so 320000 cost) spread over multiple clusters. If there is a single non-optimal cluster left, all that effort may be spent on one.\r\n\r\nHistogram for a few selected transaction counts, for the recent mempool dumps:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2985\" height=\"1787\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/320255ec-86e5-4527-bc48-07477bab08a3\" />\r\n\r\nAnd the same for the simulated 2023 dumps:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2985\" height=\"1787\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/357dea42-571c-4060-a5bf-95483a3925ba\" />\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor reference, here are the same numbers with the cost model in current master (acceptable limit = 1700), for the recent dumps: 0, 4, 10, 34, 48, 92, 122, 146, 169, 264, 242, 305, 545, 664, 491, 660, 628, 800, 868, 844, 842, 1088, 1172, 1387, 1424, 1211, 920, 1129, 1583, 1413, 978, 1404, 1838, 1611, 1492, 1701, 1248, 1506, 1541, 1792, 1458, 2045, 1533, 2656, 1380, 1938, 1789, 1534, 1726, 1800, 1825, 2181, 2532, 2213, 2216, 2437, 2600, 2535, 2581, 3101, 2571, 3472, 2351, 3552.\r\n",

That might also make it clearer if this change is reducing some ITERS values in the second commit (vs having to check if they're raised by more or less than a factor of 64000/1700)?\r\n\r\nThe \"iters\" naming now seems inaccurate, perhaps worth a scripted-diff followup?\r\n\r\nDoing a very quick check with `wip_costmodel` at 5c47cbf8dc6e18472d2df2ab14fc90ba5c18096f, and dividing all the results by a factor of 6 for running on super-old hardware, I get roughly similar results to the `core_n150` figures from the gist, which seems pretty reasonable, so I don't see any reasons to be concerned about the figures used.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be good to add the scripts to contrib/ or maintainer-tools/ so the data can be re-generated in a couple of years with a new generation of hardware (and potential code improvements)?\r\n\r\nACK 4673a5870fd66b8f91002b128963239100ce8930",

      "body": "I added two commits, one which consequently changes the terminology from \"iters\" to \"cost\" everywhere. I didn't do it as a scripted diff, as there are many variables and names, as well as comments that need changing. The other one rescales the cost by 38, and changes the ACCEPTABLE_COST value to 64000.\n\nI didn't include the scripts/tooling to construct the cost model here (yet) because it needs some cleaning up (e.g. i use a variety of cluster serialization formats, contains some fuzzing stuff that isn't appropriate here, etc). I did modify the preparatory \"introduce costmodel class\" commit to have all functions used by the benchmark code, so that it can be added as a future followup without changes to cluster_linearize.h.\r\n\r\nThis makes it much clearer what real impact the new cost model has, but to be fair: the ACCEPTABLE_COST=1700 value was set prior to #34023, which sped things up singificantly, so it wouldn't be unreasonable to also first bump the ACCEPTABLE_COST value somehow to account for that. That would make it clearer that the advance of a better cost model isn't in what it means for real-world clusters, but that it's a protection against worst case - the old naive model is likely off (by a small constant factor) for adversarially-constructed clusters.",
