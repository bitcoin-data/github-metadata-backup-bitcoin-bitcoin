    "body": "Backport of #22387.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which IP addresses are rumoured (through ADDR and ADDRV2 messages) on the network seems to vary from 0 for some non-participating nodes, to 0.005-0.025 addr/s for recent Bitcoin Core nodes. However, the current codebase will happily accept and process an effectively unbounded rate from attackers. There are measures to limit the influence attackers can have on the addrman database (bucket restrictions based on source IPs), but still - there is no need to permit them to feed us addresses at a rate that's orders of magnitude larger than what is common on the network today, especially as it will cause us to spam our peers too.\r\n    \r\nThis PR implements a [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) based rate limiter, allowing an average of 0.1 addr/s per connection, with bursts up to 1000 addresses at once. Whitelisted peers as well as responses to GETADDR requests are exempt from the limit. New connections start with 1 token, so as to not interfere with the common practice of peers' self-announcement.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of the `Peer` struct in 0.21, the relevant fields have been added to `CNodeState` instead, necessitating additional locks, and slightly different structure to avoid too much `cs_main` grabbing. The last test-improving commit has also been dropped, as the code has changed too much. Most of the behavior is still tested however, just not the part that compares with RPC statistics.\r\n",

      "message": "Rate limit the processing of incoming addr messages\n\nWhile limitations on the influence of attackers on addrman already\nexist (affected buckets are restricted to a subset based on incoming\nIP / network group), there is no reason to permit them to let them\nfeed us addresses at more than a multiple of the normal network\nrate.\n\nThis commit introduces a \"token bucket\" rate limiter for the\nprocessing of addresses in incoming ADDR and ADDRV2 messages.\nEvery connection gets an associated token bucket. Processing an\naddress in an ADDR or ADDRV2 message from non-whitelisted peers\nconsumes a token from the bucket. If the bucket is empty, the\naddress is ignored (it is not forwarded or processed). The token\ncounter increases at a rate of 0.1 tokens per second, and will\naccrue up to a maximum of 1000 tokens (the maximum we accept in a\nsingle ADDR or ADDRV2). When a GETADDR is sent to a peer, it\nimmediately gets 1000 additional tokens, as we actively desire many\naddresses from such peers (this may temporarily cause the token\ncount to exceed 1000).\n\nThe rate limit of 0.1 addr/s was chosen based on observation of\nhonest nodes on the network. Activity in general from most nodes\nis either 0, or up to a maximum around 0.025 addr/s for recent\nBitcoin Core nodes. A few (self-identified, through subver) crawler\nnodes occasionally exceed 0.1 addr/s.\n\nGithub-Pull: #22387\nRebased-From: 0d64b8f709b4655d8702f810d4876cd8d96ded82",
