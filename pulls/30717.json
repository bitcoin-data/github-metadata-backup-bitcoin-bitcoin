This PR splits off test-only RPCs to be included in `-test` flag with additional restrictions of use in `regtest` segregating the user facing and testing RPCs . These test-only RPCs are split off from args and have their own method to extract arguments . \r\n\r\nCurrent implementation of test-only RPCs follow this convention\r\n`-test=<command>=<argument>` .\r\nThe test-only rpcs with `ArgsManager::DEBUG_ONLY` with `OptionsCategory::DEBUG_TEST` options have been added.\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\nTwo more test-only arguments `-checkpoints` and `-deprecatedrpc=<method>` are excluded from this PR because of the requirement of their tests to be run on either `testnet` or `testnet3`.\r\n",
