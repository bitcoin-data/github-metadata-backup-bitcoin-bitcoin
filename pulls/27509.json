    "body": "To improve privacy, relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for relaying sensitive data (our own transactions) with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local unbroadcast transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer and the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed\r\n\r\n* Relay locally submitted transactions (from the wallet or via RPC) using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers.\r\n\r\n* Hide those transactions from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` requests, as if we don't have them.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, request the transaction with `GETDATA`, as if we didn't have it before.\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the unbroadcast list.\r\n\r\n* `INV` it to others as a result of the `TX` message we get, like what we do with transactions that are not ours.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe) \r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new local transaction is received (from the wallet or RPC), the node will send it to 5 (`SENSITIVE_RELAY_NUM_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 5 more peers (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptInitialBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived sensitive relay connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers will blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Disable if `-connect` is used or Tor and I2P are not reachable.\r\n* [x] Use I2P transient connections even if listening on I2P.\r\n* [x] Do something with the user-agent string (could reveal identity if it has been personalized) and make sure no identifying information in the `VERSION` message. Done: took the [suggestion below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418).\r\n* [x] Improve the condition when we consider the transaction seen by the network: right now a single INV from somebody suffices (this is still an improvement over `master` which is ok right after pushing the tx to a peer). We could wait for more than one INV, from peers that we have selected (outbound) and that are specifically not the ones we broadcasted to (via short-lived connection). Edit: One `INV` should be enough because after that we broadcast the transaction to everybody we are connected to (like if it is not ours).\r\n* [ ] Idea: start with one connection per transaction (not 5 as it is now), optimistically assuming it will be sufficient. (numbers are examples) After 1 minute, if still not received from the network, try 2 connections, after a few minutes try more. If still unsuccessful after 10 minutes, then fall back to the old mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to address:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450\r\n",

Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, score_before=0, score_increase=20, message='getdata message size = 50001', threshold_exceeded=false\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",

          "body": "At the moment, the eviction logic is mangled across two different components (`CConnman`, `PeerManager`), so we can't really test it in isolation. This is not completely true for the inbound eviction logic as it exists as static functions in `net.{h.cpp}` for which tests already exist. However, the outbound eviction logic is not covered by any fuzz tests and is only testable by spinning up both a connman and peerman.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits out the eviction logic into its own component `EvictionManager`. In addition to isolating the eviction logic, we get rid of several layer violations (e.g. `CConnman::ForEachNode/ForNode` calls, `CNode::m_last_block_time`, etc.) between `net` and `net processing`.\r\n\r\nOne instance of the `EvictionManager` is created at start up and passed as a reference to the connection and peer managers. The connection and peer managers report all eviction relevant information to the eviction manager who ultimately suggests nodes to evict as the result of `EvictionManager::SelectInboundNodeToEvict` and `EvictionManager::SelectOutboundNodesToEvict`.",

          "body": "This PR is a reattempt of #19645, which has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nCurrently, an existing mempool transaction can't be replaced by a transaction that's identical except for its witness (same txid, different wtxid); the request is rejected as a duplicate. This PR changes this behavior such that the mempool will replace the existing transaction if the new transaction has a smaller witness by at least 5% (an anti-Dos measure). The replacement transaction can't increase the fee (since its inputs and outputs cannot change), but it necessarily has a higher fee _rate_ than the existing transaction, since its overall size is lower. Miners should always prefer the replacement transaction.\r\n\r\nAn important difference between what this PR implements and the existing RBF (replace-by-fee, BIP125) is that the replacement can occur even if the original transaction is not marked as replaceable. This is because the replacement transaction will pay the same outputs as the transaction being replaced (identical txids ensures this), so the recipients of the existing transaction have no reason to fear not being paid by the replacement transaction. Unlike RBF, all of the existing transaction's descendants, if any, remain in the mempool.\r\n\r\nInitially, we'll limit this to single transactions (not packages); this can be reconsidered later.",

      "body": "> potentially uniquely identifying UA comment, or other fingerprints in the version message\r\n\r\nadded to the TODO in the OP\r\n\r\n> One shot connections + immediate tx broadcast without inv,getdata exchange leaks that the tx is likely being broadcast for the first time (easy to censor the tx as the receiver).\r\n\r\nYes. I was thinking its probably ok to broadcast to a few peers, not just one. And if they blackhole it, then the code will retry. We can retry more aggressively if it keeps being blackholed. I think it is ok to assume that there are some honest nodes in our addrman.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps it is worth combining this with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213 and instead of one-shot connections we broadcast only to existing selected connections on these privacy networks.\r\n\r\nThere are two aspects of this:\r\n1. Linking a bitcoin transaction to IP address/geolocation. Broadcasting to long-lived Tor/I2P connections solves this (modulo other issues like linking Tor nodes with IP addresses).\r\n2. Linking one bitcoin transaction with another bitcoin transaction that otherwise are unrelated. To solve/mitigate this we need to send each transaction over its individual connection and that connection to not be linkable to other connections.\r\n\r\n> Not sure if this should be the default or an optional mode\r\n\r\nRight, also assuming there will be bugs/unexpected things - maybe have an option to enable/disable this. Hardest would be to introduce it without an option to disable it. Softest approach would be: 1. introduce under an option with default off, 2. in next version flip the default to on (if it seems to be working well)\r\n\r\n> It might also be helpful to combine this with some heuristics that the tx percolated through the network:\r\nFor example, require that 2 of your regular full outbound connections (that you didn't send it to ) have inv'ed the tx back to you - otherwise try again after some time.\r\n\r\nI actually changed the behavior to do something like that in 512077bb8805eacb671eabcf9d62463a2a6e6a39 `net_processing: relay local transactions via the SENSITIVE_RELAY mechanism` in this PR: see where `RemoveUnbroadcastTx()` was called before / is called now. Maybe that deserves a separate commit. Before we would be ok as long as we pushed the tx to the peer. Now we wait until we receive an `INV` about that tx from somebody. There is some room for improvement - added in the TODO in the OP.",

This increases privacy and will also make it harder to perform fingerprinting attacks (connecting our identities over different networks).\r\n\r\nManual Block-Relay connections:\r\n- can be specified with `-addnode` RPC, both with the `add` and `onetry` command\r\n- can be specified with the `-addnode` bitcoind arg (or in bitcoin.conf) with `<IP>=manual-block-relay`\r\n- don't participate in transaction and address relay\r\n- don't get discouraged / punished for misbehavior (but will still get disconnected for sending TX/tx-INV as automatic block-relay-only peers do)\r\n- are not subject to outbound eviction logic (unlike automatic block-relay-only-peers)\r\n",

          "body": "This question was raised on Telegram group some time ago. It looks nobody has tried this, but I believe fundamentally there should be no problems in doing this, JM should work with blocksonly nodes.\r\n\r\nThere are two problems though that likely needs to be tested and solved somehow:\r\n\r\n1) Fee estimation for confirmation block target will not work, `estimatesmartfee` will fail with \"Fee estimation disabled\" error. One solution for users is to just manually specify feerate, another would be to potentially introduce other fee estimation sources, like mempool.info, I believe that could be doable without privacy loss via Tor (and we could implement multiple of them, so there would be no single point of failure).\r\n\r\n2) Makers running in blocksonly mode will not see unconfirmed transactions. I don't think our current code will handle that well. But that should be solvable. We could ask random other peers (either other JM makers using existing communication channels or write some light client for this purpose that talks directly to Bitcoin nodes in network [Wasabi Wallet have this for transaction broadcast]) have they seen this transaction. Also maybe we should store such transactions locally in wallet file or somewhere else until they are included in block. This is related to #1465.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we want more people to use JoinMarket and there are two ways forward in this regard, which aren't mutually exclusive - implement other blockchain sources that doesn't require full node or reduce requirements for people running full nodes. Pruned blocksonly node saves both disk space and RAM. Which is important for people running stuff on VPSes, where storage and RAM are the most scarce resources. And I would better spend my time working on reducing full node hardware requirements than implementing light clients. Because we also need more people running fully validating Bitcoin nodes.",

But we may as well send to a few peers at the same time, then wait. And, I am not sure, maybe if it does not work for a long time, then fall back to the existent mechanism?\r\n\r\nThe worst that can happen is if our addrman is filled with malicious Tor peers that blackhole such initial announcements. But even if 90% of them are blackholes, then after a dozen attempts we should eventually send to a honest node which will propagate it to the network. Attempts are cheap and don't reveal any of the identity of the sender.\r\n",

          "body": "This PR replaces the `m_recently_announced_invs` bloom filter with a simple sequence number tracking the mempool state when we last considered sending an INV message to a node. This saves 33kB per peer (or more if we raise the rate at which we relay transactions over the network, in which case we would need to increase the size of the bloom filter proportionally).\r\n\r\nThe philosophy here (compare with #18861 and #19109) is that we consider the rate limiting on INV messages to only be about saving bandwidth and not protecting privacy, and therefore after you receive an INV message, it's immediately fair game to request any transaction that was in the mempool at the time the INV message was sent. We likewise consider the BIP 133 feefilter and BIP 37 bloom filters to be bandwidth optimisations here, and treat transactions as requestable if they would have been announced without those filters. Given that philosophy, tracking the timestamp of the last INV message and comparing that against the mempool entry time allows removal of each of `m_recently_announced_invs`, `m_last_mempool_req` and `UNCONDITIONAL_RELAY_DELAY` and associated logic.",

          "body": "**WORK IN PROGRESS.** Please do not run it for any use other than testing.\r\n  \r\nThis PR is not meant for merge. This branch exists to help reviewers see what package relay would look like all together. I will open separate PRs for these components and expect to add more tests, docs, and polish along the way. This PR contains all of the functionality built in a linear manner. However, since there are pieces in various areas of the codebase and they can make progress in parallel, commits don't necessarily need to be merged in this order.\r\n\r\n**See #27463 for what PR(s) are open for review right now.**\r\n\r\n## Note to Reviewers\r\n\r\nThe major purpose of this PR is to solicit \"approach\" review.\r\n\r\nThis is a large project, and the first few p2p commits essentially define the interface. I'd like to get rough consensus on approach before we start looking at code details and merging PRs, because I believe it will help us \"get useful stuff in\" faster and avoid premature optimizations.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions I hope are answered before we try to merge anything (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27742#issuecomment-1572205313):\r\n\r\n1. Does the proposed protocol look sound?\r\n2. Are these 3 milestones appropriate?\r\n3. Is there important functionality that is in the \"todo improvements\" section but should be included in one of the 3 milestones? Alternatively, is there not-that-important stuff in the milestones that we should defer until later?\r\n4. Does it make sense to have this PeerManager <-> TxDownloadMan interface?\r\n\r\nComments about naming, typos, code details, etc. are also appreciated but please note I may wait until their respective PRs are open to incorporate your comments. Thank you for your patience.\r\n\r\n### Design Docs\r\n\r\nBIP: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1382\r\nOrphanage changes: https://gist.github.com/glozow/7c0ff639f996e660146314edffa6f06c\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\n\r\n### 3 Major Milestones\r\n\r\nThis project is split into 3 milestones, each of which gives us something useful.\r\n\r\n1. Modularize and improve orphan-handling (also some refactoring).\r\n\t- Introduce a `TxDownloadManager` class, responsible for downloading transactions that have been announced to us.\r\n\t- Use all announcers as potential candidates for resolving an orphan. Add a `TxRequestTracker` Orphan Request Tracker which helps track orphans we need to resolve. Preferentially request orphan resolution from outbounds, preferred relay, etc., over inbounds.\r\n\r\n2. When package relay peers are available, use `ancpkginfo` instead of missing parents when handling orphans.\r\n\t- Add `sendpackages` negotiation logic.\r\n\t- Add a separate rejections filter for transactions that are eligible for reconsideration when validated together as a package, so that children of low-feerate transactions are still considered.\r\n\t- Send `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO)` to package relay peers for orphan resolution. Use `ancpkginfo` to request missing ancestors through normal individual transaction relay.\r\n\r\n3. Download and validate ancestor packages using `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`.\r\n\t- Add support for `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`. Send a `pkgtxns` using the list of missing transactions from `ancpkginfo`.\r\n\t- Ensure we can process \"normal\" orphans even if a peer is trying to overwhelm/churn our orphanage. Do this by \"opportunistically\" protecting orphans from random eviction if they were sent by package relay peers, and redownloading orphans if we cannot afford to protect them. Each peer is allocated a certain amount of orphans they can protect at a time (\"token bucket\" style but the number of tokens is static for now). Outbound peers get more than inbounds.\r\n\t- If a transaction's parent(s) are below the fee filter, don't announce it (save the bandwidth of legacy nodes).\r\n\r\n###  Todo improvements \r\nThese could be added to the milestones or deferred until basic functionality is deployed.\r\n- Store orphans serialized instead of as CTransactionRefs to significantly reduce their memory usage.\r\n- Perhaps try to keep orphans in disk and/or process them asynchronously, given the incredibly DoSable nature of orphan handling.\r\n- Dynamically allocate tokens for orphan protection. For example, if a long-standing inbound peer continuously provides good packages for orphans, they should have more tokens. If a peer is obviously serving us garbage, reduce their tokens.\r\n- Detect when we have received all the transactions for a package, regardless of how (individual or block or other), and return `PackageToValidate`  in `GetTxToReconsider`.\r\n- New format for mempool.dat, packages instead of transactions.",

      "body": "`>>` This is ready for review and testing `<<`\r\n\r\n> ... if the transaction is sent along with the potentially uniquely identifying UA comment, or other fingerprints in the version message. Maybe it makes sense to define a static version message ...\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke, I went with a [completely static `VERSION` message](https://github.com/vasild/bitcoin/blob/b73810f80917dd882d6161f6892f10f8c46a8193/src/net_processing.cpp#L1439-L1446)\r\n\r\n> ... Perhaps it's worth mimicking `bitcoin-submittx`\r\n\r\n@sipa, [done](https://github.com/vasild/bitcoin/blob/b73810f80917dd882d6161f6892f10f8c46a8193/src/net_processing.cpp#L1444)\r\n\r\n> Or it could randomize it, from the list of different version strings.\r\n\r\n@kristapsk, could be, but I did not do that (yet). I think a constant suffices and is the simplest thing to do.\r\n\r\n> Not sure if this should be the default or an optional mode\r\n\r\n@mzumsande, I made it optional, guarded by a new option `-sensitiverelayowntx` which is \"off\" by default. If all goes well, we can consider flipping the default to \"on\" after one release.\r\n\r\n> It might also be helpful to combine this with some heuristics that the tx percolated through the network: For example, require that 2 of your regular full outbound connections (that you didn't send it to ) have inv'ed the tx back to you - otherwise try again after some time.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense and is a room for improvement, let me summarize:\r\n\r\n* In `master` we consider the transaction percolated through the network after we push it to a peer (no wait for `INV` from somebody else).\r\n* In this PR, currently, we want for `INV` from somebody, ask for the full transaction with `GETDATA` and after we receive it, then consider it done.\r\n\r\nI am trying to strike a balance between simplicity (too simple and maybe it will break) and robustness (requires more complexity). Now, at the cost of more complexity we can require more:\r\n* an `INV` from more than one peer.\r\n* an `INV` from IPv4, IPv6 or CJDNS peer.\r\n* an `INV` from an outbound peer.\r\n\r\nWe have to start behaving normally after we get the first `INV`, which means to relay to all peers and include the transaction in `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` replies. Thus to achieve any of the above, it would be necessary to split the list of \"unbroadcast\" transactions in two:\r\n1. (now) transactions that we have to send via short-lived sensitive relay connections and we hide from `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL` and ask for the full transaction once we get `INV`\r\n2. (new list) transactions that we have to send via short-lived sensitive relay connections, but we have already received them via at least one `INV`, so include them in `GETDATA` and `MEMPOOL`\r\n\r\n> If a spy is connected to each node, we might send the tx to them first currently (master), but with the PR, if we are now the only node that never inv's the tx to them at all (provided that all other nodes do that eventually with the flooding mechanism) that would equally identify us as the source.\r\n\r\n@mzumsande, I believe that is fixed now - once we get an `INV`, we will flood it to everybody and start behaving normally.\r\n\r\n> Might be good to have some way of being able to configure where to connect to for sensitive relay, defaulting to tor/i2p, but so that you could perhaps enable specific ipv4/ipv6 addresses as well, particularly for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n@ajtowns, sensitive relay via IPv4 seems like a way to shoot yourself in the foot. I extended the testing framework a bit to have a proper functional test for this.\r\n\r\n> ... if a spy is able to reliably fingerprint a node between networks, this mechanism could potentially degrade privacy ...\r\n\r\n@amitiuttarwar, no because the spy will not be able to relate the sensitive relay connection to another connection with the transaction originator on the same network.\r\n\r\n> The connection should be established after another tor/i2p connection is dropped - this way the connection appears to be just another connection - nothing special about it.\r\n> It may also be useful to randomize the duration of the connection?\r\n> Additionally - padding the connection with dummy txs during its lifecycle may help obfuscate the real payload?\r\n\r\n@RandyMcMillan, I am not sure why another connection should be dropped. I think adding more transactions in the broadcast is going to bring little value because they will be transactions that have already propageted through the network. A spy would be able to identify which one is the unbroadcast transaction. The point here is that even that the spy knows this is initial broadcast, they can't identify the sender and the worst they can do is blackhole the transaction.\r\n\r\n> > One shot connections + immediate tx broadcast without inv,getdata exchange leaks that the tx is likely being broadcast for the first time (easy to censor the tx as the receiver).\r\n\r\n> I agree. My main concern is about how to ensure the transaction has not been censored. It seems easy for an attacker to identify someone opened a connection just to relay its own transaction.\r\n\r\n@brunoerg, Yes, that should be ok.\r\n\r\n> Ideally, if outbound has clearnet connections, we would resume normal operation IFF one of those connections INV's it. This reduces risk of sybil influencing the node.\r\n\r\n@instagibbs, Yes, see a few lines above, we would need two lists of unbroadcast transactions.\r\n",

We then ensure that bitcoin attempts to reconnect to that anchor address on restart.\r\n\r\nTo compute the addrv2 serialization of the onion v3 address, I added logic to `CAddress` in `messages.py`. This new logic is covered by extending `p2p_addrv2_relay.py` to include an onion v3 address. Future work will be adding coverage for ipv6, torv2 and cjdns in these modules and also `feature_proxy.py`\r\n\r\nAlso includes de/serialization unit test for `CAddress` in test framework.\r\n",

          "body": "This is joint work with mzumsande. \r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to diversify outbound connections with respect to reachable networks. The existing logic evaluates peers for connection based purely on the frequency of available addresses in `AddrMan`. This PR adds logic to automatically connect to alternate reachable networks and adds eviction logic that protects one existing connection to each network. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if `AddrMan` is populated primarily with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and only a handful of onion addresses, it is likely that we won't establish any automatic outbound connections to Tor, even if we're capable of doing so. For smaller networks like CJDNS, this is even more of an issue and often requires adding manual peers to ensure regularly being connected to the network.\r\n\r\nConnecting to multiple networks improves resistance to eclipse attacks for individual nodes. It also benefits the entire p2p network by increasing partition resistance and privacy in general. \r\n\r\nThe automatic connections to alternate networks is done defensively, by first filling all outbound slots with random addresses (as in the status quo) and then adding additional peers from reachable networks the node is currently not connected to. This approach ensures that outbound slots are not left unfilled while attempting to connect to a network that may be unavailable due to a technical issue or misconfiguration that bitcoind cannot detect.\r\n\r\nOnce an additional peer is added and we have one more outbound connection than we want, outbound eviction ensures that peers are protected if they are the only ones for their network.\r\n\r\nManual connections are also taken into account: If a user already establishes manual connections to a trusted peer from a network, there is no longer a need to make extra efforts to ensure we also have an automatic connection to it (although this may of course happen by random selection). \r\n",

A possibility could be through a net permission flag, if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27114 makes it in.\"\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17167#issuecomment-1168606032 - \"This would allow us to use https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25355 when making outgoing connections to all nodes, except to whitelisted ones for which we would use our persistent I2P address.\"\r\n- Force-relay/mempool permissions for a node you intentionally connected to.\r\n",

      "body": "@instagibbs added some more info to the OP, but feel free to reach on `#bitcoin-core-dev` to clarify things. Once a local transaction is is received, 5 such connections will be made right away. If we still consider the transaction unbroadcast after 10-15 mins, then it will be retried (5 new connections). These 10-15 mins are how `master` does things now but I think if sensitive relay is used this can be made more aggressive and/or increase the number of peers we broadcast to. E.g. after 3 minutes broadcast to 10 peers.\r\n\r\n> General question about this: what will be the impact on tor/i2p nodes? (Like, resources-wise for those operators) are there even enough hidden services nodes with inbound slots to support this?\r\n\r\n@pinheadmz, good question. Traffic-wise - the selected recipients will receive the transaction via a short-lived connection, but even now they do receive the transaction in one way or another. The overhead is the extra handshake of the new connection. Some quick tests show, from the point of view of the tx sender: sent 180 bytes (excluding the transaction itself), received 239 bytes.\r\n\r\nInbound slots-wise: Some [back of the envelope calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation):\r\n* The historical maximum for the Bitcoin network of incoming transactions has been about 10 new transactions per second, typically that is 3-4 tx/sec. Lets say `3..10` tx/sec.\r\n* Each new tx causes 5 new connections to be opened, so for one second `15..50` new connections will be opened in total in that second (`3*5..10*5`).\r\n* Lets say one short-lived connection takes `2..10` seconds. That is a moving window of `2..10` seconds.\r\n* In the next `2..10` seconds they will not be closed and so for `2..10` seconds `30..500` new connections will be opened (`2*15..10*50`).\r\n* The constant load of those `30..500` extra connections will be spread evenly amongst ~10k listening Tor or I2P nodes. So each listening Tor or I2P node will have to handle `0.003..0.05` more incoming connections.\r\n\r\n>  In a world where all TXs are broadcast to the network through \"exit nodes\" are there any other possible drawbacks ?\r\n\r\nBy \"exit nodes\" you mean the new sensitive relay mechanism and not Tor-to-IPv4 exit nodes, right? If the Tor or I2P network stops working then the Bitcoin nodes that are connected to it and have the sensitive relay enabled will not be able to broadcast their transactions. Maybe we should eventually fall back to the old relay mechanism after some time has passed in unsuccessful sensitive relay attempts.\r\n\r\nBut notice - as the author of this, I have a blind spot for its drawbacks!",

          "body": "Fixes #27744\r\n\r\nSince #27278 we log received headers. For compact blocks we also log which peer sent it (e5ce8576349d404c466b2f4cab1ca7bf920904b2), but not for regular headers. That required an additional refactor, which this PR provides.\r\n\r\nMove the logging from validation to net_processing.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the number of log entries (under default configuration) per compact block header from 3 to 2: one for the header and one for the connected tip.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces a new helper method `LogBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a _compact block_ we call `LogBlockHeader` from the exact same place as where we previously logged. So that log message doesn't change. What does change is that we no longer _also_ log from `AcceptBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a regular header(s) message, _we only log the last one_. This is a change in behaviour because it was simpler to implement, but it's probably better anyway. It does mean that if a peer sends of a bunch of headers of which _any_ is invalid, we won't log it (here).\r\n\r\nLastly I expanded the code comment explaining why we log this. It initially only covered selfish mining, but we also care about peers sending us headers but not following up (see e.g. #27626).\r\n\r\nExample log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:21Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:12:23Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000045910263ef84b575ae3af151865238f1e5c619e69c330 height=792964 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223098 tx=848176824 date='2023-06-05T13:11:49Z' progress=1.000000 cache=6.4MiB(54615txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 peer=0\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:05Z UpdateTip: new best=00000000000000000003c6fd4ef2e1246a3f9e1fffab7247344f94cadb9de979 height=792965 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223112 tx=848179461 date='2023-06-05T13:13:58Z' progress=1.000000 cache=7.2MiB(61275txo)\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:41Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 peer=8\r\n2023-06-05T13:14:42Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000048e6d69c8399992782d08cb57f5d6cbc81a9f996c3f43 height=792966 version=0x2db3c000 log2_work=94.223126 tx=848182944 date='2023-06-05T13:14:35Z' progress=1.000000 cache=8.0MiB(69837txo)\r\n```",

Logging was added pre-patch to document the delay through the queue and was observed for both send and receive to be occasionally > 30 seconds when the daemon was busy following the tip or during reorgs when the cup utilization for the assigned core  approached 100%.  Significant queue delay occurs most often in the receive queue (several times a minute) and infrequently in the send queue ( 1 observation in several hours of testing ).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n  _Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply._\r\n- [X ] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [X ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [ ] I have added or updated relevant unit/integration/functional/e2e tests\r\n- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation\r\n- [ ] I have assigned this pull request to a milestone _(for repository code-owners and collaborators only)_\r\n",

          "body": "This is milestone 1 of package relay p2p changes. See #27463 for full project tracking.\r\n\r\nPlease see #27742 for how this PR fits into the big picture. I strongly suggest that reviewers look at that PR first to decide if they are comfortable with the overall approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly refactors, with a few behavior changes and improvements:\r\n- Introduces `TxDownloadManager`, which handles all transaction downloading. It contains the `TxRequestTracker`, `TxOrphanage`, and filters for `AlreadyHaveTx`.\r\n- Updates logs for tx {validation, relay, orphans} to include both txid and wtxid when possible.\r\n- Adds a new log category, `TXPACKAGES`. Logging in the orphanage is changed from `MEMPOOL` to `TXPACKAGES`.\r\n- Adds support for tracking when multiple peers provided the same tx in the orphanage.\r\n- Makes `TxDownloadManager` responsible for tracking the orphans we need to resolve and deciding how/when to resolve them.\r\n- Adds all announcers of an orphan as potential resolution candidates. This tracker is a `TxDownloadManager` which helps us schedule requests.\r\n   - In this PR, \"orphan resolution\" means requesting missing parents by `getdata(MSG_TX | MSG_WITNESS_FLAG, missing_txid)`.\r\n    - In a future PR, we'll add another resolution method, requesting ancestor wtxids using `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO, orphan_wtxid)`.",

      "body": "Not sure how effective it is to put the transaction into the mempool. I know that your implementation treats the positive case (reply to an `inv` as if the tx wasn't there, or withhold the tx in reply to a `getdata`). However, a failure to reply to an otherwise valid `inv` can still be used to query the mempool. Or similarly, a failure to (also) withhold related transactions in an otherwise valid `getdata` can be used to query the mempool. (For example, if the transaction was a CPFP and the parent can't be in your mempool due to the minimum fee-rate, but your node happily replies).\r\n\r\nI don't think there is a general solution to this, other than to never add the transaction to the mempool.",

      "body": "Ran with this feature on signet and found a few unexpected behaviors:\r\n\r\n1. `-sensitiverelay=1` and `-onlynet=ipv4` should probably throw an init error. In this configuration, sensitive stuff seems to be ignored and new wallet TXs are relayed via ipv4 peers like normal. Is \"only use tor for sensitive relay\" a possible configuration? 👉 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#discussion_r1281726530\r\n\r\n2. Rapidly sending multiple transactions `\"...incremented the number of connections to open from 20 to 25...\"` this number grows rapidly and decreases slowly (especially on signet) I wonder if it should max out at some point or reduce the tx:relay-peer ratio from 5:1 to just 1:1 👉 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#discussion_r1281768350\r\n\r\n3. Restarting the node and reloading the wallet logged messages about pushing the unbroadcast TXs to the mempool, but I do not think any sensitive-relay connections were triggered to deliver those. Eventually I tried sending another new TX and then, even though only 5 sensitive connections were being opened for that one new TX, over time those connections were used for some of the backlog (\"pretending peer requested tx...\"). Until the 5 sensitive connections dropped down to 0. **update: eventually `ReattemptInitialBroadcast` triggered and the backlog increased the count to 100 sensitive connections 👉 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#discussion_r1281830292\r\n\r\n4. Finally, on signet I never got an INV for one of my own txs back. so `getmempoolinfo : unbroadcastcount` only ever increased. I notice that the tests only use python `P2PInterface()`'s for peers and the `observer_outbound` peer and is manually forced to inv our txid... makes me wonder if real bitcoind peers have different enough relay behavior that it doesnt work as well in production. For example, we pretend our sensitive relay peers requested a tx when they didn't. Does bitcoind still relay TXs it didn't getdata for? Also I suppose given that some of my signet TXs weren't going out, there could be an issue with orphans and peers that are missing my parents. I may try writing tests with more network bitcoind nodes, or set it up locally but routed through Tor. 👉 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#discussion_r1284610972\r\n\r\nI'm going to continue playing with all this and see if I can figure anything out. It's definitely cool to see some `srelay` connections pop up in the `-netinfo` dashboard!",

Can you elaborate on the CPFP example?\r\n\r\nIn general, wrt the privacy of the transaction originator, do you think that the \"sensitive relay\" mechanism from this PR could be worse than the current \"send to all\" from `master` in some cases? Or do you think that it is better than `master` but it can be done even better?",

      "body": "> do you think that the \"sensitive relay\" mechanism from this PR could be worse \r\n\r\nYes, my understanding is that this pull strictly decreases privacy when the underlying wallet makes use of transactions chains (whether or not for intentional or accidental CPFP shouldn't matter), or transaction replacements, or mutually exclusive transactions (\"conflicts\", \"double-spends\" or insufficient rbf-fee), or if the transaction recipient is the attacker and can create transactions spending the \"sensitive\" output. The CPFP example is just an example. The general idea is that it is impossible to hide a transaction being in the mempool once it is added to the mempool.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this pull makes it strictly worse, is because previously an attacker could only guess which was the originating node. Now, the attacker can uniquely identify the node.\r\n\r\nFor example (using the CPFP example):\r\n\r\n* Wallet creates a low_fee_tx and relays it to the whole network.\r\n* A day later, Wallet sees the low_fee_tx was dropped from the local (small) mempool (with a lower minfee than the rest of the network) and creates a high_fee_tx child, adding back the parent to the mempool.\r\n* The attacker receives `high_fee_tx` as \"sensitive\" transaction. (With less precision the attack should work as well, if the attacker received the transactions as a fluffed transaction from the network).\r\n* The attacker, being connected to all clearnet network nodes and knowing the minfee of all network nodes (via the feefilter message), ask all nodes for high_fee_tx and low_fee_tx.\r\n* The only node that withholds high_fee_tx and replies with low_fee_tx, despite it violating the minfeefilter it requested its peers to honour, is the victim node. Thus, it is uniquely identified.\r\n\r\nI don't think this unique identification is currently possible.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I am missing something, or if I should come up with more examples.",

I considered this in the beginning but I got the impression that this is going to be more complicated. Anyway I want to first try to address all concerns or, if not possible, get convinced that putting the transaction in the mempool is non-workable. Edit: some parts of this PR will be reused even if changed to skip the mempool.\r\n\r\nI don't like the idea of a separate tool because that's like saying \"we can't get the current software to do it properly, so we will create another software\".\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke, yes, more concrete examples to try to shoot this down are welcome ;-)",

Or, even could be employed in\r\nspecial procedures like a prune node rescan that uses BIP158 block filters,\r\nor even into BIP157 itself.",

As I said previously, this can be observed with current wallet settings, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1660280410. So I think all you'd need to do here is add yet another setting to the wallet (disabled by default) to enable this feature.\r\n\r\nConceptually, it seems easier to fix, review and test the local wallet issue about counting change, than it is to fix the remote p2p behavior of withholding or supplying transactions that are in or out of the mempool.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "we discussed this proposal in person, and I wanted to share some of my current thoughts here: \r\n- I agree with the alternate approach to keep the transaction out of the mempool. it's very difficult to ensure that there aren't any information leaks, and even if we are able to achieve that with the current code, it is unrealistic to be able to maintain that over time \r\n- the idea of starting via RPC submission only seems like a good way to incrementally develop this feature \r\n- in the current implementation, we schedule opening 5 connections per transaction, but then there's randomness around which one of the transactions each connection decides to broadcast. this could lead to a lot of variability if there are multiple transactions queued around the same time, which doesn't seem desirable. It makes more sense to me for there to be a direct mapping\r\n\r\n@vasild \r\n>  I will change this to not add the transaction to the mempool. I am just figuring out how to exactly handle it.\r\n\r\nmy recommendation is to make this PR a draft until you have a new proposal and are ready for further review. happy to take a look when the new approach is figured out :) ",

So using a specific trusted peer to rebroadcast seems reasonable.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, user might have a Transport v2 connection and it's biggest worry is his ISP spying on him. In this case the user might want to use (one of) his v2 connected peers for (re)broadcasting the tx.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nnew RPC `sendrawtransactiontopeer`, where the raw tx and peer are specified\r\n(somewhat similar to `sendmsgtopeer`)\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n- [have an argument in `sendrawtransaction` to specify a peer](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876#issue-879140859)\r\n- [ _use -connect=<ip> to connect only to the specified node(s)._](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876#issuecomment-1212166950) (for this, the user would need to restart and disconnect all other peers every time he wants to do it)\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876, similar request but suggesting to add an argument in `sendrawtransaction` to mention the peer\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509, useful but `sendrawtransactiontopeer` would still be a good addition imo\r\n\r\n**Could this be used by malicious parties (who want to get a better view of the network etc)?** \r\nMaybe, but they might already be doing that with a modified client.\r\n\r\nIn contrary, `sendrawtransactiontopeer` might make transaction broadcast/relay analysis harder.",

I haven't found any discussion in the repo, so I will summarize the relevant parts here and share my thoughts.\r\n\r\nLet's say we have a node that operates both over ipv4 and TOR. We don't want an observer to link these two addresses to the same node. For example, ADDR caching (#18991) was implemented for this reason.\r\n\r\nThe paper suggests the following attack:\r\n1. Fill all (115?) victim's inbound slots in `networkA.`\r\n2. Make sure these connections are candidates for eviction (higher latency, etc.).\r\n3. Make connection to the presumably-victim's node in `networkB`\r\n4. Observe whether `networkA` connections from (1) are dropped as you add connections in networkB.\r\n\r\nI haven't verified the experiments, but even understanding the attack assures me the problem exists. Authors claim to reach high precision at a very low cost (optimized by inspecting`VERSION` data and block relay data).\r\n\r\nThey suggest the following countermeasures:\r\n1. Have separate connection pools (for the sake of eviction) for each network (say TOR and ipv4).\r\n2. Make eviction unpredictable (e.g. after a random delay)",

          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* Independent improvement (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29419):\r\n  * `log: deduplicate category names and improve logging.cpp`\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

      "body": "I opened a new PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415 to continue with this.\r\n\r\n> in the current implementation, we schedule opening 5 connections per transaction, but then there's randomness around which one of the transactions each connection decides to broadcast. this could lead to a lot of variability if there are multiple transactions queued around the same time, which doesn't seem desirable. It makes more sense to me for there to be a direct mapping\r\n\r\n@amitiuttarwar, I was thinking about this, but realized that once connman has opened N private broadcast connections they are identical from peerman's point of view. They don't have to be tied to transactions like \"connection1 for txA\", \"connection2 for txB\". Since connection1 and connection2 are identical, it may as well be \"connection2 for txA\" and \"connection1 for txB\".\r\n\r\nTo avoid the variability, e.g.  one transaction to be broadcast more times than another, I introduced a priority for the transactions based on how many times one has been broadcast and how recently. Then peerman picks the tx with a higher priority when it starts processing a private broadcast connection.\r\n\r\nI don't feel strongly about this, but it seems to be working well and avoids communication between peerman and connman like:\r\n* peerman to connman: open 1 connection for txA\r\n* connman to peerman: this connection is for txA\r\n\r\nAlso, if a transaction is quickly received back from the network and removed from the broadcast list, then the remaining connections created due to it will be used for broadcasting others instead.",

Inside `PeerManagerImpl::ScheduleLocalTxForRelay()` `UseSensitiveRelay()` would return `false` and `m_connman.ScheduleSensitiveRelayConnections()` which increments the counter will never be called.\r\n\r\nNow, that is the logic of some code far away, in another file. I did not want to rely on it because if we enter here and both are unreachable, then it will end up in an infinite loop. An assert that at least one is reachable is the other option, but I am trying to code this \"defensively\", following @sdaftuar's comment from another PR that excessive asserts in the networking code are better avoided.",

Next idea is to use the non-customized user-agent even if `-uacomment=` is configured. But then, why even reveal the version - whether it is 26.0 or 27.0? Right after a new release there will be few nodes that run the just-released version and thus the anonymity set will be small. So this string better be constant - either empty string or whatever other constant. `/pynode:0.0.1/` was suggested here - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509#issuecomment-1517896418",

      "body": "> sending the TX without doing INV/GETDATA first risks having the TX be ignored as unrequested\r\n\r\nI thought about doing `INV` first and waiting for get data but decided to not do that for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Bitcoin Core accepts unsolicited transactions. According to https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/p2p_networking.html#tx there is already some software that sends unsolicited transactions.\r\n2. It would add complexity to the implementation.\r\n3. After `INV` we would have to wait for some time for `GETDATA`, then in some cases when the wait is too little we risk cutting the connection just before we get `GETDATA`.\r\n4. Last, but this is the most important IMO: it does not matter. There is redundancy: the transaction will be sent to more than one peer and we will retry if we don't hear back from the network about it. It is expected and is ok if some of the peers we send the transaction drops it.\r\n\r\n> `PushUnbroadcastTx` doesn't actually send the TX, but `MaybeSendPing` does actually send the PING, so you might get the PONG and closes the connection before the other end has actually received/processed the TX\r\n\r\nI don't think so. Both `PushUnbroadcastTx()` and `MaybeSendPing()` end up calling `PushMessage()` which enqueues the message in `CNode::vSendMsg`. This is done synchronously so the transaction will go before the ping. Then messages from `CNode::vSendMsg` are processed and sent in the order they were added (FIFO).\r\n",

So I wonder if that should be asserted at the top? Or could be renamed to `PushUnbroadcastTxToSensistiveRelay()`? At the very least maybe sensitive-only should be explained in the function description on L933 ?\r\n\r\nRight. While this function will work if called for non-sensitive-relay peer (it will send the tx to the peer), this is not the intention because it will be bad for privacy and it is only called under `if (pfrom.IsSensitiveRelayConn()) {`.\r\n\r\nRenamed as suggested and added `Assume()`;",

In this configuration, sensitive stuff seems to be ignored and new wallet TXs are relayed via ipv4 peers like normal.\r\n\r\nThis check was supposed to prevent that but it was too strict. Apparently you have `listenonion=1` which means that later, after startup, we will connect to the Tor control and may set the Tor proxy and make the Tor network reachable. It is a bit weird that `listenonion` remains with the default `1` when `onlynet=ipv4` is used. It means the node will only make outgoing connections to IPv4, but will listen for and accept incoming connections from the Tor network :eyes:.\r\n\r\nI relaxed the check to also trigger the error if `onlynet` has been used (and if `!IsReachable(NET_ONION)` at the time of the check, that means `onlynet` was used but tor was omitted from it).\r\n\r\n> Is \"only use tor for sensitive relay\" a possible configuration?\r\n\r\nYes, if the node does not have I2P connectivity. Then only Tor will be used. But if the node has both Tor and I2P connectivity then both will be used. Do you mean that if both networks are reachable, to use only Tor for sensitive relay? I didn't do that because I see no usecase for it.",

Restarting the node and reloading the wallet logged messages about pushing the unbroadcast TXs to the mempool, but I do not think any sensitive-relay connections were triggered to deliver those. Eventually I tried sending another new TX and then, even though only 5 sensitive connections were being opened for that one new TX, over time those connections were used for some of the backlog (\"pretending peer requested tx...\"). Until the 5 sensitive connections dropped down to 0. **update: eventually `ReattemptInitialBroadcast` triggered and the backlog increased the count to 100 sensitive connections\r\n\r\nThis looks to be the same in `master` (I only read the code). Maybe it can be improved. When a new transaction arrives, `BroadcastTransaction()` is called which adds it to the mempool (via `node.mempool->AddUnbroadcastTx()`) and also schedules it for relay (via `node.peerman->ScheduleLocalTxForRelay()`).\r\n\r\nHowever after a restart, `LoadMempool()` only adds it to the mempool (via `pool.AddUnbroadcastTx()`). `BroadcastTransaction()` is not called and neither `ScheduleLocalTxForRelay()` is called.\r\n\r\nThis should improve it:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>[patch] relay all unbroadcast transactions at startup</summary>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git i/src/net_processing.cpp w/src/net_processing.cpp\r\nindex b541cba0b9..1300d0daf0 100644\r\n--- i/src/net_processing.cpp\r\n+++ w/src/net_processing.cpp\r\n@@ -510,13 +510,14 @@ public:\r\n     bool ProcessMessages(CNode* pfrom, std::atomic<bool>& interrupt) override\r\n         EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(!m_peer_mutex, !m_recent_confirmed_transactions_mutex, !m_most_recent_block_mutex, !m_headers_presync_mutex, g_msgproc_mutex);\r\n     bool SendMessages(CNode* pto) override\r\n         EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(!m_peer_mutex, !m_recent_confirmed_transactions_mutex, !m_most_recent_block_mutex, g_msgproc_mutex);\r\n \r\n     /** Implement PeerManager */\r\n-    void StartScheduledTasks(CScheduler& scheduler) override;\r\n+    void StartScheduledTasks(CScheduler& scheduler) override\r\n+        EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(!m_peer_mutex);\r\n     void CheckForStaleTipAndEvictPeers() override;\r\n     std::optional<std::string> FetchBlock(NodeId peer_id, const CBlockIndex& block_index) override\r\n         EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(!m_peer_mutex);\r\n     bool GetNodeStateStats(NodeId nodeid, CNodeStateStats& stats) const override EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(!m_peer_mutex);\r\n     bool IgnoresIncomingTxs() override { return m_opts.ignore_incoming_txs; }\r\n     void SendPings() override EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(!m_peer_mutex);\r\n@@ -1869,22 +1870,33 @@ PeerManagerImpl::PeerManagerImpl(CConnman& connman, AddrMan& addrman,\r\n         m_txreconciliation = std::make_unique<TxReconciliationTracker>(TXRECONCILIATION_VERSION);\r\n     }\r\n }\r\n \r\n void PeerManagerImpl::StartScheduledTasks(CScheduler& scheduler)\r\n {\r\n+    AssertLockNotHeld(m_peer_mutex);\r\n+\r\n     // Stale tip checking and peer eviction are on two different timers, but we\r\n     // don't want them to get out of sync due to drift in the scheduler, so we\r\n     // combine them in one function and schedule at the quicker (peer-eviction)\r\n     // timer.\r\n     static_assert(EXTRA_PEER_CHECK_INTERVAL < STALE_CHECK_INTERVAL, \"peer eviction timer should be less than stale tip check timer\");\r\n     scheduler.scheduleEvery([this] { this->CheckForStaleTipAndEvictPeers(); }, std::chrono::seconds{EXTRA_PEER_CHECK_INTERVAL});\r\n \r\n     // schedule next run for 10-15 minutes in the future\r\n     const std::chrono::milliseconds delta = 10min + GetRandMillis(5min);\r\n     scheduler.scheduleFromNow([&] { ReattemptInitialBroadcast(scheduler); }, delta);\r\n+\r\n+    if (m_opts.sensitiverelayowntx) {\r\n+        for (const auto& txid : m_mempool.GetUnbroadcastTxs()) {\r\n+            CTransactionRef tx = m_mempool.get(txid);\r\n+            if (tx != nullptr) {\r\n+                ScheduleLocalTxForRelay(txid, tx->GetWitnessHash());\r\n+            }\r\n+        }\r\n+    }\r\n }\r\n \r\n /**\r\n  * Evict orphan txn pool entries based on a newly connected\r\n  * block, remember the recently confirmed transactions, and delete tracked\r\n  * announcements for them.

Finally, on signet I never got an INV for one of my own txs back. so getmempoolinfo : unbroadcastcount only ever increased. I notice that the tests only use python P2PInterface()'s for peers and the observer_outbound peer and is manually forced to inv our txid... makes me wonder if real bitcoind peers have different enough relay behavior that it doesnt work as well in production. For example, we pretend our sensitive relay peers requested a tx when they didn't. Does bitcoind still relay TXs it didn't getdata for? Also I suppose given that some of my signet TXs weren't going out, there could be an issue with orphans and peers that are missing my parents. I may try writing tests with more network bitcoind nodes, or set it up locally but routed through Tor.\r\n\r\nThe witness was not serialized, so the recipients rejected the transaction :face_with_spiral_eyes: I fixed this and updated the test to catch cases where `bitcoind` would not accept or further relay the transaction to other peers. Now the test has one more `bitcoind`, which is used as a recipient.",

The proposal to ignore unsolicited transactions was rejected. There is no known software that rejects such transactions. There is already a software that sends unsolicited transactions (BitcoinJ).\r\n\r\nMost importantly - _it does not hurt to send the transaction even if the peer is going to ignore it._ We have connected already. If there is even 1% chance that the peer will relay it, then our best action is to send the transaction without bothering whether that is 1% or 99%. That is, both of the following achieve the same, but the first is more complex to implement, review and maintain:\r\n\r\n* Connect, send `INV`, wait... aha! that peer does not care about new transactions, disconnect (could even make a mistake if the wait is too short)\r\n* Connect, send `TX`, disconnect\r\n\r\n- If it is a proper peer they will relay it in both cases.\r\n- If it is a peer that does not relay transactions (but has signaled txrelay=1 in their `VERSION` message), in IBD or whatever, they will not relay the transaction in both cases.\r\n",
