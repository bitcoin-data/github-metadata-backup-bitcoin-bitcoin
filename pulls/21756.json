They are usually represented as eight 16-bit segments.\"_\r\n* IPv6 socket address ([std::net::SocketAddrV6](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.SocketAddrV6.html)): _\"IPv6 socket addresses consist of an IPv6 address, a 16-bit port number, as well as fields containing the traffic class, the flow label, and a scope identifier (see IETF RFC 2553, Section 3.3 for more details).\"_",

The new implementation of IPv6ToString (which is called from CNetAddr::ToString) follows Rust's std::net::Ipv6Addr which does not append %zone_index. FWIW that is how the previous implementation of CNetAddr::ToString worked under macOS.\r\n\r\nYes, as the removed test and as #21690 showed, macOS returns a different getnameinfo format for scoped ids, without the zone id, from all the other platforms that do provide support for it.  Why should we align with the macOS exception without discussing it?  Does it not make sense to call attention to this change?",
