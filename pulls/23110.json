We then check it against the list of known IPs in China.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24623306/134964358-42202933-c57b-45bf-9856-237ed7f0f4b3.png)\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n* Currently only supports IPv4, but IPv6 support could be added in a similar way.\r\n* Relies on a trusted server to determine our external IP address. In the future, we may want to query additional services (e.g. whatismyip.com) to guard against issues with myexternalip.com.\r\n* Relies on a static list of subnets - We could replace the list with a call to http://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/data/countries/cn.zone, but this introduces an additional trusted service.
