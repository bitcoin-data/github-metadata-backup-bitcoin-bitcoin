    "body": "Fixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30266\r\n\r\nMiniupnpc 2.2.8 [changed the function signature of `UPNP_GetValidIGD`](https://github.com/miniupnp/miniupnp/commit/c0a50ce33e3b99ce8a96fd43049bb5b53ffac62f#diff-5a0d7cff00628c2c64a617edb347c0f283e3a75e7df910e7e8438fc6db23f610R122) without taking much care with the abi :(\r\n\r\nThis is the minimal change to cope with that. Also included in this PR is a temporary bump to 2.2.8 to verify that it builds correctly. I'm happy to revert that and discuss the bump separately, as miniupnpc bumps require some scrutiny.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is problematic if we build against one version and encounter a different one at runtime. This is not a problem for depends because we build statically. But for users who are self-building against shared system libs, care must be taken to run against the same version used for linking.\r\n\r\nSome quick digging shows that at least Ubuntu/Arch make the distinction between soversions:\r\n`libminiupnpc.so.17` -> `libminiupnpc.so.18`. So in practice, I suppose this shouldn't be much of a problem.\r\n\r\nBoooo for the upstream loose abi policy.",
