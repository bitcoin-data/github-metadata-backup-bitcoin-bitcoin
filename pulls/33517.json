    "body": "This fixes https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/215 on Core's side. It depends on https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/220 being merged upstream, and a PR to update our subtree. I've included a subtree merge from my repo here for now, but will rebase on top of the merge from upstream once it's in.\r\n\r\nFor context: without https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/220, libmultiprocess serializes every log message parameter, even if that message was ultimately going to be discarded. The upstream PR accomplishes 2 main things:\r\n- Creates logging categories, similar to Core's\r\n- Using macros, avoids serializing parameters for disabled log levels.\r\n\r\nThat allows the expensive serialization to be skipped, but the default log level is `Trace`. This PR updates our usage of libmultiprocess options to honor our log categories and levels.\r\n\r\nBecause of the substantial unnecessary overhead (see the [flamegraphs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/215). Logging accounts for 50% of my application's cpu time, and nearly 10% of bitcoin-node's, both of which go to ~0% once fixed), it'd be a shame to ship the first multiprocess binaries without this fixed. So I propose that we also backport this (and the required libmultiprocess subtree merge) to v30. Sorry about the timing :(",
