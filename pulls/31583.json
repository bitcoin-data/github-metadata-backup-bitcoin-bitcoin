    "body": "Extracted from #31564.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways to represent the proof-of-work in a block:\r\n\r\n1. nBits\r\n2. Difficulty\r\n3. Target\r\n\r\nThe latter notation is useful when you want to compare share work against either the pool target (to get paid) or network difficulty (found an actual block). E.g. for difficulty 1 which corresponds to an nBits value of `0x00ffff`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nshare hash: f6b973257df982284715b0c7a20640dad709d22b0b1a58f2f88d35886ea5ac45\r\ntarget:     7fffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's immediately clear that the share is invalid because the hash is above the target.\r\n\r\nThis type of logging is mostly done by the pool software. It's a nice extra convenience, but not very important. So for now I limited the RPC change to two methods:\r\n\r\n1. `gettarget` gives the target for the tip block, akin to `getdifficulty`\r\n2. `getmininginfo` displays the `target` for the tip block\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat useless, so I added a boolean argument `next` to `getdifficulty` and `gettarget` to get these values for the _next block_ (typically the same, except for the first retarget block and on testnet3 / testnet4 if no block was found after 20 minutes).\r\n\r\nSimilarly I added a `next` object to `getmininginfo` which shows `bit`, `difficulty` and `target` for the next block. The easiest way to test that is by running testnet4 and changing your clock to 3 hours in the future; the next difficulty will drop to 1. \r\n\r\nThere's a bunch more places that render `difficulty`. If people prefer, I can add `target` in all such places. Only caveat is that `blockheaderToJSON` avoids a lock on `cs_main` for \"performance reasons\", but calculating the target requires the PoW limit, and obtaining that involves a lock on the chainman.  \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a helper method `DeriveTarget()`. Although `CheckProofOfWorkImpl` could use it, this PR does not touch that method.\r\n\r\nThe proposed `checkblock` RPC in #31564 needs this helper method internally to figure out the consensus target. It uses the `getmininginfo` in a test, though this could be replaced by manually calculated targets. The `DeriveTarget()` helper is the main thing I need for #31564.\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR moves `pow.cpp` and `chain.cpp` from `bitcoin_node` to `bitcoin_common`, in order to give `rpc/util.cpp` (which lives in `bitcoin_common`) access to `pow.h`.",

So added a `next` argument to `getdifficulty` and `gettarget` and a `next` object to `getmininginfo`. You'll have to test this manually, because regtest doesn't have difficulty adjustment.\r\n\r\nI might push a test that uses the testnet4 genesis block and the rule that difficulty resets to 1 after 20 minutes.",
