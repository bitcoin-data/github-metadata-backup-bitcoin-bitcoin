    "body": "**tl&dr for consensus-code only reviewers**: the first commit splits `CheckProofOfWorkImpl()` in order to create a `DeriveTarget()` helper. The rest of this PR does not touch consensus code. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three ways to represent the proof-of-work in a block:\r\n\r\n1. nBits\r\n2. Difficulty\r\n3. Target\r\n\r\nThe latter notation is useful when you want to compare share work against either the pool target (to get paid) or network difficulty (found an actual block). E.g. for difficulty 1 which corresponds to an nBits value of `0x00ffff`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nshare hash: f6b973257df982284715b0c7a20640dad709d22b0b1a58f2f88d35886ea5ac45\r\ntarget:     7fffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's immediately clear that the share is invalid because the hash is above the target.\r\n\r\nThis type of logging is mostly done by the pool software. It's a nice extra convenience, but not very important. It impacts the following RPC calls:\r\n\r\n1. `gettarget` gives the target for the tip block, akin to `getdifficulty`\r\n2. `getmininginfo` displays the `target` for the tip block\r\n3. `getblock` and `getblockheader` display the `target` for a specific block (ditto for their REST equivalents)\r\n\r\nThe `gettarget` and `getdifficulty` methods are a bit useless in their current state, because what miners really want to know if the target / difficulty for the _next_ block. So I added a boolean argument `next` to `getdifficulty` and `gettarget`. (These values are typically the same, except for the first block in a retarget period. On testnet3 / testnet4 they change when no block is found after 20 minutes).\r\n\r\nSimilarly I added a `next` object to `getmininginfo` which shows `bit`, `difficulty` and `target` for the next block.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the difficulty transition, an alternate mainnet chain with 2016 blocks was generated and used in `mining_mainnet.py`. The chain is deterministic except for its timestamp and nonce values, which are stored in `mainnet_alt.json`.\r\n\r\nAs described at the top, this PR introduces a helper method `DeriveTarget()` which is split out from `CheckProofOfWorkImpl`. The proposed `checkblock` RPC in #31564 needs this helper method internally to figure out the consensus target.\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR moves `pow.cpp` and `chain.cpp` from `bitcoin_node` to `bitcoin_common`, in order to give `rpc/util.cpp` (which lives in `bitcoin_common`) access to `pow.h`.",

When configured to avoid internet connectivity, it seems reasonable to me to use testnet4 and canned data (`data/testnet4.hex`).\r\n\r\nThe bitcoin.conf for the test node has `dnsseed=0`, `fixedseeds=0`, and `connect=0`, which should help avoid internet traffic. Added a sleep in `run_test()` and didn't see internet traffic from the test node in Wireshark.\r\n\r\nPlanning to circle back and test a bit on mainnet.",

      "body": "Here we go!\r\n\r\nI generated an alternate mainnet with 2016 blocks, storing timestamps and nonces. The process is explained at the top of the renamed test file: ee1dcc6074323ae361e28cf235ddfc9bf07be1da. \r\n\r\nI did leave out some minutia for readability sake, and because things will change over time. E.g. I had to disable the `miner.isTestChain())` guard in `getblocktemplate`, I patched the CPU miner to work with taproot payout addresses https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer/pull/293 and set the coinbase version to https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer/pull/294. However it's trivial to work around those when reconstructing or expanding these test vectors.\r\n\r\nI also left out some rpc and jq incantations to generate the json file.\r\n\r\n47bf1086dacfc504699d672dc3faf8a77eceee67 changes the BIP34 padding from `OP_1` to `OP_0` in the test suite, which will also impact new signets (but it shouldn't matter).",

Maybe add \"Compact representation of the block difficulty target, which the block hash interpreted as a little-endian number must not be greater than. This is hexadecimal string containing 32-bit number with the compact representation described in the arith_uint256 class of the difficulty target.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI also think it's really unfortunate the RPC is returning this compact representation, and it would be better if RPCs returned uncompressed difficulty targets which would be easier to understand and are directly comparable to block hashes. e.g.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nresult.pushKV(\"hash\", blockindex.GetBlockHash().GetHex());\r\narith_uint256 target;\r\ntarget.SetCompact(blockindex.nBits);\r\nresult.pushKV(\"target\", ArithToUint256(target).GetHex());\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: I see later commits actually do add \"target\" fields which do this. In that case, I think it would be good to just document bits fields as a containing a compact representation of the target fields, since the target representation is a lot more straightforward.",
