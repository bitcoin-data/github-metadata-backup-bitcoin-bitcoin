    "body": "Extracted from #31564.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways to represent the proof-of-work in a block:\r\n\r\n1. nBits\r\n2. Difficulty\r\n3. Target\r\n\r\nThe latter notation is useful when you want to compare share work against either the pool target (to get paid) or network difficulty (found an actual block). E.g. for difficulty 1 which corresponds to an nBits value of `0x00ffff`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nshare hash: f6b973257df982284715b0c7a20640dad709d22b0b1a58f2f88d35886ea5ac45\r\ntarget:     7fffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's immediately clear that the share is invalid because the hash is above the target.\r\n\r\nThis type of logging is mostly done by the pool software. It's a nice extra convenience, but not very important. So for now I limited the RPC change to two methods:\r\n\r\n1. `gettarget` gives the target for the tip block, akin to `getdifficulty`\r\n2. `getmininginfo` displays the `target` for the tip block\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat useless, so I added a boolean argument `next` to `getdifficulty` and `gettarget` to get these values for the _next block_ (typically the same, except for the first retarget block and on testnet3 / testnet4 if no block was found after 20 minutes).\r\n\r\nSimilarly I added a `next` object to `getmininginfo` which shows `bit`, `difficulty` and `target` for the next block.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the difficulty transition, the first 2016 testnet4 blocks are added to the test suite and used in `mining_testnet.py`.\r\n\r\nThere's a bunch more places that render `difficulty`. If people prefer, I can add `target` in all such places. Only caveat is that `blockheaderToJSON` avoids a lock on `cs_main` for \"performance reasons\", but calculating the target requires the PoW limit, and obtaining that involves a lock on the chainman.  \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a helper method `DeriveTarget()`. Although `CheckProofOfWorkImpl` could use it, this PR does not touch that method.\r\n\r\nThe proposed `checkblock` RPC in #31564 needs this helper method internally to figure out the consensus target. It uses the `getmininginfo` in a test, though this could be replaced by manually calculated targets. The `DeriveTarget()` helper is the main thing I need for #31564.\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR moves `pow.cpp` and `chain.cpp` from `bitcoin_node` to `bitcoin_common`, in order to give `rpc/util.cpp` (which lives in `bitcoin_common`) access to `pow.h`.",

So added a `next` argument to `getdifficulty` and `gettarget` and a `next` object to `getmininginfo`. You'll have to test this manually, because regtest doesn't have difficulty adjustment.\r\n\r\nI might push a test that uses the testnet4 genesis block and the rule that difficulty resets to 1 after 20 minutes.",

Maybe add \"Compact representation of the block difficulty target, which the block hash interpreted as a little-endian number must not be greater than. This is hexadecimal string containing 32-bit number with the compact representation described in the arith_uint256 class of the difficulty target.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI also think it's really unfortunate the RPC is returning this compact representation, and it would be better if RPCs returned uncompressed difficulty targets which would be easier to understand and are directly comparable to block hashes. e.g.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nresult.pushKV(\"hash\", blockindex.GetBlockHash().GetHex());\r\narith_uint256 target;\r\ntarget.SetCompact(blockindex.nBits);\r\nresult.pushKV(\"target\", ArithToUint256(target).GetHex());\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: I see later commits actually do add \"target\" fields which do this. In that case, I think it would be good to just document bits fields as a containing a compact representation of the target fields, since the target representation is a lot more straightforward.",
