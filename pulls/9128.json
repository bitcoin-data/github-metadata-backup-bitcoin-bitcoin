    "body": "This contains a more complete version of #9117, as well as the changes promised to @TheBlueMatt in #8708. They're combined here because the PushMessage changes require that the SendVersion is sane. This will be my last time messing with PushMessage, and it's nearing the end of the net changes needed outside of actual net code...\r\n\r\nThe changes here:\r\n- Don't send messages after fDisconnect is set. (feeler connections are a TODO exception).\r\n- Don't use CSerializeData for outgoing data, which incurred a memory_cleanse for each message. Messages aren't secret, and going forward, if they are they'll be encrypted.\r\n- Add a thin, featureless serializer to turn any set of args into a byte vector.\r\n- Add an go-between message maker so that CConnman sees only serialized messages for pushing.\r\n- That means that the caller is now responsible for determining the node's send version. That's a good thing, it can now move to CNodeState as later step.\r\n- CConnman attaches the header and hashes the byte vector. @jonasschnelli: This should be very easy to adapt to bip151. A new flag SERIALIZE_BIP151_ENCRYPTED or so can be added and used similar to SERIALIZE_TRANSACTION_NO_WITNESS.\r\n",

      "body": "Fixed several things:\n- Fixed @jonasschnelli's whitespace nit\n- Fixed win32 build, broken due to missing cast\n- Addressed @TheBlueMatt's complaints:\n  - Back to using `pnode->nVersion == 0` to detect lack of version message\n  - Added a change to hold off on setting fDisconnect for feelers until later, to avoid attempting to send messages to a disconnected node. The behavior is kept the same here, but imo it should be changed as a follow-up.\n  - zero copies when sending to the net. CSerializedNetMsg now advises how much padding it may possibly need. Its copy ctor and copy assignment operator are deleted to ensure no copies.\n  - CVectorInserter::pad and CVectorOverWriter::skip. I'm not sure if these are exactly what you needed, but I took a guess :)\n",

The PRs are as follows:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9037 - net: Add test-before-evict discipline to addrman\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5151 - make CMessageHeader a dumb storage class\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6589 - log bytes recv/sent per command\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8688 - Move static global randomizer seeds into CConnman\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9050 - net: make a few values immutable, and use deterministic randomness for the localnonce\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8708 - net: have CConnman handle message sending\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9128 - net: Decouple CConnman and message serialization\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8822 - net: Consistent checksum handling\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9441 - Net: Massive speedup. Net locks overhaul\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9609 - net: fix remaining net assertions\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9626 - Clean up a few CConnman cs_vNodes/CNode things\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9698 - net: fix socket close race\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9708 - Clean up all known races/platform-specific UB at the time PR was opened\r\n  - Excluded bitcoin@512731bed0782f10092de35a960153b17ecc11eb and bitcoin@d8f2b8a8c032b83a3bd90750e58abaeece7e34e7, to be done in a separate PR",

If it's to be encrypted, we'll need some per-node state vars.\n\nSo I guess it depends whether encryption status and state are to end up somewhere in main like CNodeState, or in CNode. Since (for once) this seems like something CConnman should know about but nobody else should have to care, I figured CNode was the likely place.\n",

All internal structures could change without affecting the net side.\n\nDealing with wrapping the raw bytes up for transmission is something different, and arguably not something that the bitcoin side should have to know/care about. If you have a different model in your mind, please suggest it.\n\nCNode is slowly moving towards an internal dumb storage class. So in this case, I don't make much distinction.\n",
