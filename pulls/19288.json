May I ask you a re-review and hopefully give your fourth(!) ACK for this change? :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Fuzzing review beg: If we only had two or three more reviewers (like @Crypt-iQ!) who were willing to review fuzzing harnesses that would make such a huge difference for the state of fuzzing in the project. Please consider reviewing!** ❤️ \r\n\r\nSome fuzzing harnesses awaiting review:\r\n* #19065: tests: Add fuzzing harness for CAddrMan. Fill some fuzzing coverage gaps.\r\n* #19203: net: Add regression fuzz harness for CVE-2017-18350. Add FuzzedSocket. Add thin SOCKET wrapper.\r\n* #19259: tests: Add fuzzing harness for LoadMempool(...) and DumpMempool(...)\r\n* #19288: tests: Add fuzzing harness for TorController\r\n* #19415: net: Make DNS lookup mockable, add fuzzing harness\r\n* #19972: tests/net: Add fuzzing harness for node eviction logic. Make node eviction logic testable.\r\n",

It kind of violates encapsulation and makes the headers larger and less usefully self-documenting.\r\n\r\nThat said, I do not see any other solution in the immediate context here. A longer-term direction would be to have test-specific headers that expose internal functionality for unit testing[, benching, fuzzing] but are never included in production code.\r\n\r\nACK 10d4477dae663631411a1bd5a92e4fa941d3a96c\r\n",
