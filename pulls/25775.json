    "body": "We have pretty thorough documentation of our RBF policy in doc/policy/mempool-replacements.md. It enumerates each rule with several sentences of rationale. Also, each rule pretty much has its own function (3 and 4 share one), with extensive comments. The doc states explicitly that our rules are similar but differ from BIP125, and contains a record of historical changes to RBF policy.\r\n\r\nWe should not use \"BIP125\" as synonymous with our RBF policy because:\r\n- Our RBF policy is different from what is specified in BIP125, for example:\r\n    - the BIP does not mention our rule about the replacement feerate being higher (our Rule 6)\r\n    - the BIP uses minimum relay feerate for Rule 4, while we have used incremental relay feerate since #9380\r\n    - the \"inherited signaling\" question (CVE-2021-31876). Call it discrepancy, ambiguous wording, doc misinterpretation, or implementation details, I would recommend users refer to doc/policy/mempool-replacements.md\r\n    - the signaling policy is configurable, see #25353\r\n- Our RBF policy may change further\r\n- We have already marked BIP125 as only \"partially implemented\" in docs/bips.md since 1fd49eb498c75a1d14193bb736d195a3dc75ae12\r\n- See comments from people who are not me recently:\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#discussion_r909507429\r\n    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25575#issuecomment-1179519204\r\n\r\nThis PR removes all non-signaling mentions of BIP125 (if people feel strongly, we can remove all mentions of BIP125 period). It may be useful to refer to the concept of \"tx opts in to RBF if it has at least one nSequence less than (0xffffffff - 1)\" as \"BIP125 signaling\" because:\r\n- It is succint.\r\n- It has already been widely marketed as BIP125 opt-in signaling.\r\n- Our API uses it when referring to signaling (e.g. getmempoolentry[\"bip125-replaceable\"] and wallet error message \"not BIP 125 replaceable\"). Changing those is more invasive.\r\n- If/when we have other ways to signal in the future, we can disambiguate them this way. See #25038 which proposes another way of signaling, and where I pulled these commits from.\r\n\r\nAlternatives:\r\n- Changing our policy to match BIP125. This doesn't make sense as, for example, we would have to remove the requirement that a replacement tx has a higher feerate (Rule 6).\r\n- Changing BIP125 to match what we have. This doesn't make sense as it would be a significant change to a BIP years after it was finalized and already used as a spec to implement RBF in other places.\r\n- Document our policy as a new BIP and give it a number. This might make sense if we don't expect things to change a lot, and can be done as a next step.\r\n",

As the dominant implementation on the network Core is setting the default policy rules for the vast majority of nodes and attempting to maintain compatibility with a BIP means more scrutiny and an alternative point of reference to compare to. (The recent exercise of comparing current Core code to BIP125 for example was much more rigorous than it would have been if comparing Core code to an internal Core doc that may or may not be up to date.)\r\n\r\nedit: Maybe it is acceptable (or even desirable) for the RBF rules to be in a constant state of flux. There have been multiple ideas/proposals on changing the RBF rules in recent months. In that case a new BIP clearly does not make sense. But if the aspiration is to have a set of RBF rules with strong rationales that don't regularly change, moving from having a BIP to internal Core documentation seems like an erosion of scrutiny to me.",

The comments can (and should) refer to BIP125 e.g. BIP125 rule X and explain what differences there are between a BIP125 rule and how it is implemented in Core.\r\n\r\n>  It would feel a bit strange to refer to the rules by № if there was no documentation that comprehensively enumerates them as such anymore.  If e.g. the details were deleted from BIP125, should the rules perhaps be listed in code documentation? Otherwise, a new BIP to supersede BIP125 and document the actual behavior would sound useful.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is widely known, but doc/policy/mempool-replacements.md lists each rule with several sentences of rationale. Each rule pretty much has its own function (3 and 4 share one), with extensive comments. The doc states explicitly that our rules are similar but differ from BIP125, and contains a record of historical changes to RBF policy. Comments about what code *doesn't* do and referencing BIPs it *doesn't* implement is just clutter and confusing.",

      "body": "> Maybe it is acceptable (or even desirable) for the RBF rules to be in a constant state of flux. There have been multiple ideas/proposals on changing the RBF rules in recent months. In that case a new BIP clearly does not make sense. But if the aspiration is to have a set of RBF rules with strong rationales that don't regularly change, moving from having a BIP to internal Core documentation seems like an erosion of scrutiny to me.\r\n\r\n@glozow: Perhaps you can comment on the above then. There is a difference between cross checking code with a formal static doc like a BIP and updating regularly changing documentation (assuming one remembers to). Otherwise there is no argument to BIP or spec anything in Core whatsoever (except maybe consensus changes).",

It wasn't clear to me from the first post's description that this already existed—you could perhaps highlight that more in the first post. Given that most of the nodes on the network are Bitcoin Core, I'm not sure whether a BIP is strictly needed in that case then, but a BIP might still be a bit easier to discover. Since it's bad to have two diverging authoritative sources, I would agree that a BIP should wait until the rules aren't expected to change much anymore.",

It wasn't clear to me from the first post's description that this already existed—you could perhaps highlight that more in the first post.\r\n\r\nThanks, done!\r\n\r\n> if the aspiration is to have a set of RBF rules with strong rationales that don't regularly change, moving from having a BIP to internal Core documentation seems like an erosion of scrutiny to me. There is a difference between cross checking code with a formal static doc like a BIP and updating regularly changing documentation (assuming one remembers to). Otherwise there is no argument to BIP or spec anything in Core whatsoever (except maybe consensus changes).\r\n\r\nPutting code documentation in a BIP does not inherently make it more correct or up-to-date. There is a pretty large logical leap here from \"docs should change when code changes\" to \"there's no point in writing a spec.\" Feel free to open a PR if you see a divergence between code and documentation, which is what this PR is doing.",

This is not a criticism of that work, it is important, challenging and difficult to follow. But when security of L2 protocols are depending on it (whether we like it or not) and it is possible to achieve I do think a set of static RBF rules with clear rationales is what we should be aiming for.",
