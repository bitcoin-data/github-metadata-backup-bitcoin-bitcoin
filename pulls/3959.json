    "body": "New RPC methods: return an estimate of the fee (or priority) a transaction needs to be likely to confirm in a given number of blocks.\n\nFee-per-kilobyte estimates for 1..10 confirmations from this code:\n\n```\ngavin$ for i in {1..10}; do ./bitcoind estimatefee $i; done\n0.00044643\n0.00044248\n0.00044053\n0.00029499\n0.00020492\n0.00014970\n0.00012981\n0.00012190\n0.00011769\n0.00011217\n```\n\nMike Hearn created the first version of this method for estimating fees.\nIt works as follows:\n\nFor transactions that took 1 to N (I picked N=25) blocks to confirm, keep N buckets with at most 100 entries in each recording the fees-per-kilobyte paid by those transactions.\n\n(separate buckets are kept for transactions that confirmed because they are high-priority)\n\nThe buckets are filled as blocks are found, and are saved/restored as part of the mempool.dat file.\n\nA few variations on Mike's initial scheme:\n\nTo estimate the fee needed for a transaction to confirm in X buckets, all of the samples in all of the buckets are used and a median of all of the data is used to make the estimate. For example, imagine\n25 buckets each containing the full 100 entries. Those 2,500 samples are sorted, and the estimate of the fee needed to confirm in the very next block is the 50'th-highest-fee-entry in that sorted list; the estimate of the fee needed to confirm in the next two blocks is the 150'th-highest-fee-entry, etc.\n\nThat algorithm has the nice property that estimates of how much fee you need to pay to get confirmed in block N will always be greater than or equal to the estimate for block N+1. It would clearly be wrong\nto say \"pay 11 uBTC and you'll get confirmed in 3 blocks, but pay 12 uBTC and it will take LONGER\".\n\nA single block will not contribute more than 10 entries to any one bucket, so a single miner and a large block cannot overwhelm the estimates.\n",

      "message": "estimatefee / estimatepriority RPC methods\n\nNew RPC methods: return an estimate of the fee (or priority) a\ntransaction needs to be likely to confirm in a given number of\nblocks.\n\nMike Hearn created the first version of this method for estimating fees.\nIt works as follows:\n\nFor transactions that took 1 to N (I picked N=25) blocks to confirm,\nkeep N buckets with at most 100 entries in each recording the\nfees-per-kilobyte paid by those transactions.\n\n(separate buckets are kept for transactions that confirmed because\nthey are high-priority)\n\nThe buckets are filled as blocks are found, and are saved/restored\nin a new fee_estiamtes.dat file in the data directory.\n\nA few variations on Mike's initial scheme:\n\nTo estimate the fee needed for a transaction to confirm in X buckets,\nall of the samples in all of the buckets are used and a median of\nall of the data is used to make the estimate. For example, imagine\n25 buckets each containing the full 100 entries. Those 2,500 samples\nare sorted, and the estimate of the fee needed to confirm in the very\nnext block is the 50'th-highest-fee-entry in that sorted list; the\nestimate of the fee needed to confirm in the next two blocks is the\n150'th-highest-fee-entry, etc.\n\nThat algorithm has the nice property that estimates of how much fee\nyou need to pay to get confirmed in block N will always be greater\nthan or equal to the estimate for block N+1. It would clearly be wrong\nto say \"pay 11 uBTC and you'll get confirmed in 3 blocks, but pay\n12 uBTC and it will take LONGER\".\n\nA single block will not contribute more than 10 entries to any one\nbucket, so a single miner and a large block cannot overwhelm\nthe estimates.",

      "body": "ACK.  Speaking conservatively, appears to be low impact as implemented at first glance.\n\nThe largest impact is to existing operations is the hook that is executed when a block appears, necessitating the removal of TXs from the mempool.  At a quick glance, it was difficult to discern the big-O() of this operation, but at least it is all in CPU/RAM, and only executed once per incoming new block.\n\nOne nit (perhaps for post merge):  I don't like the mempool itself doing the reading.  Would prefer a helper function outside the mempool class that perform the necessary I/O.  Our normal pattern is a pure implement-serialize chain until actual file I/O is needed.  This seems to mix metaphors a bit more than usual.\n",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3.
