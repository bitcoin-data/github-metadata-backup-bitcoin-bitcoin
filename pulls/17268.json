    "body": "_Hansel and Gretel\r\nleft bread crumb trails as they went\r\nbut birds ate them all._\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request improves the asymptotic complexity of many of the mempool's algorithms as well as makes them more performant in practice.\r\n\r\nIn the mempool we have a lot of algorithms which depend on rather computationally expensive state tracking. The state tracking algorithms we use make a lot of algorithms inefficient because we're inserting into various sets that grow with the number of ancestors and descendants, or we may have to iterate multiple times of data we've already seen.\r\n\r\nTo address these inefficiencies, we can closely limit the maximum possible data we iterate and reject transactions above the limits.\r\n\r\nHowever, a rational miner/user will purchase faster hardware and raise these limits to be able to collect more fee revenue or process more transactions. Further, changes coming from around the ecosystem (lightning, OP_SECURETHEBAG) have critical use cases which benefit when the mempool has fewer limitations.\r\n\r\nRather than use expensive state tracking, we can do something simpler. Like Hansel and Gretel, we can leave breadcrumbs in the mempool as we traverse it, so we can know if we are going somewhere we've already been. Luckily, in bitcoind there are no birds!\r\n\r\nThese breadcrumbs are a uint64_t epoch per CTxMemPoolEntry. (64 bits is enough that it will *never* overflow). The mempool also has a counter.\r\n\r\nEvery time we begin traversing the mempool, and we need some help tracking state, we increment the mempool's counter. Any CTxMemPoolEntry with an epoch less than the MemPools has not yet been touched, and should be traversed and have it's epoch set higher.\r\n\r\nGiven the one-to-one mapping between CTxMemPool entries and transactions, this is a safe way to cache data.\r\n\r\nUsing these bread-crumbs allows us to get rid of many of the std::set accumulators in favor of a std::vector as we no longer rely on the de-duplicative properties of std::set.\r\n\r\nWe can also improve many of the related algorithms to no longer make heavy use of heapstack based processing.\r\n\r\nThe overall changes are not that big. It's 302 additions and 208 deletions. You could review it all at once, especially for a Concept Ack. But I've carefully done them in small steps to permit careful analysis of the changes. So I'd recommend giving the final state of the PR a read over first to get familiar with the end-goal (it won't take long), and then step through commit-by-commit so you can be convinced of the correctness for more thorough code reviewers.\r\n\r\n**But is it good in practice?** Yes! Basic benchmarks show it being 5% faster on the AssembleBlock benchmark, and 14.5% faster on MempoolEviction, but they aren't that tough. Tougher benchmarks, as described below, show a **>2x speedup**. \r\n\r\n> PR #17292, adds a motivating benchmark for the Epoch Mempool.\r\n> \r\n> ./src/bench/bench_bitcoin --filter=ComplexMemPool --scaling=5\r\n> \r\n> Before:\r\n> \r\n>     # Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median\r\n>     ComplexMemPool, 5, 5, 6.62715, 0.264409, 0.265441, 0.2654\r\n> \r\n> After:\r\n> \r\n>     # Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median\r\n>     ComplexMemPool, 5, 5, 3.07116, 0.122246, 0.12351, 0.122783\r\n> \r\n> This shows a > 2x speedup on this difficult benchmark (~2.15x across total, min, max, median).\r\n> \r\n> Note: For scientific purity, I created it \"single shot blind\". That is, I did not modify the test at all after running it on the new branch (I had to run it on master to fix bugs / adjust the expected iters for a second parameter, and then adjust the internal params to get it to be about a second).\r\n\r\n**What's the catch?** The specific downsides of this approach are twofold:\r\n\r\n1) We need to store an extra 8 bytes per CTxMemPoolEntry\r\n2) Some of the algorithms are a little bit less obvious & are \"less safe\" to call concurrently (e.g., from a recursive call, not necessarily in parallel)\r\n\r\nBut for these two specific downsides:\r\n\r\n1) The 8 bytes could be reduced to 4 (with code to reset all CTxMemPoolEntries near overflow, but then we would need to more carefully check that we won't overflow the epoch in a recursive call.\r\n2) The 8 bytes could be a 4 byte index into a table of 8 (or 4, or even fewer) Byte epochs + back pointer, at expense of indirection like vTxHashes. Then we would only ever need as many epochs as the things we walk per-epoch.\r\n3) We can replace the epoch with an atomic<epoch>, which would allow for new parallel graph traversal algorithms to build descendants more quickly\r\n4) Some algorithms benefit from recursive epoch use\r\n\r\nSo overall, I felt the potential benefits outweigh the risks.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What's next?**\r\nI've submitted this a bit early for review to gain concept acks on the approach, independent testing, and feedback on methodologies for testing, as well as to collect more worst-case edge conditions to put into benchmarks. It's not quite a WIP -- the code passes tests and is \"clean\", but it should receive intense scrutiny before accepting.",

This prevents a called function from creating an epoch guard (via assertion). While there is occasionally use for a multiple outstanding epochs, none are implemented currently.

From each such parent, we then select Rand(remaining outputs) +1 50% of the time, or 1 outputs 50% of the time.\r\n\r\nThen, we trim the size to 3/4. Then we trim it to just a single transaction.\r\n\r\nThis creates, hopefully, a big bundle of transactions with lots of complex structure, that should really put a strain on the mempool graph algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ends up testing both the descendant and ancestor tracking.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't love that the test is \"unstable\". That is, in order to compare this test to another, you really can't modify any of the internal state because it will have a different order of invocations of the deterministic randomness. However, it certainly suffices for comparing branches.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "This seems like a moderately important area for optimization.  One thing that might be worth keeping in mind:  It would probably be useful to support a \"fast but imprecise\" accounting method for the first block template after a new block.  This is really easy to do with the current code (just skip updating the costs while inserting transactions), not sure if your work would change that.\r\n\r\n[Aside, usually when talking about improving asymptotic complexity people ignore constant factors. You might want to use different language when describing this work to avoid confusing people.]\r\n\r\nIn theory, I think the common case where confirmation includes an entire disjoint subgraph at once it should be possible to make that linear time (by basically noticing that the entire subgraph is removed, so any cost updates can be skipped).  Interestingly: for attack resistance the worst case (permitted by policy) is what matters... but for revenue reasons the average case is more important.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there are greater wins though from speedups or from latency hiding hacks. e.g. if one keeps a small redundant highest fee only mempool perhaps without CPFP dependency tracking at all, and uses it while the real stuff is updating in the background... then it probably doesn't matter that much if the main mempool is taking tens of seconds.",

      "body": "Thanks for the review @gmaxwell.\r\n\r\nI think the \"fast but imprecise\" accounting method is not affected at all by this change, but someone who has implemented that should verify.\r\n\r\nI've also used the terminology correctly RE: asymptotes. Imagine a set of O(N) transactions which each have 1 output, and a single transaction which spends all outputs. Assembling the ancestors (e.g., in CalculateMemPoolAncestors) will iterate over O(N) inputs and make O(N log N) comparisons in set entries. In the new code I've written, you do O(N) work as it's O(1) (rather than O(log N)) to query if we've already included it.\r\n\r\nNow, you're correct to note that in the benchmark I gave, it's only a constant factor. This is the purpose of the benchmark; a \"believable\" transaction workload. As noted above, the O(N^2) work manifests as a result of the structure of that test specifically -- you have N transactions you're inserting into the mempool, and you need to percolate the updated package info up the tree every insert. Thus, you end up making N*N traversals. Thus, short of some sort of magic metadata data structure, any implementation's improvements will manifest lower-bounded by W(N^2).\r\n\r\nI can generate some micro benchmarks which show that Epoch Mempool beats out the status quo in asymptotes. I figured it's less interesting than showing it's better in the domain of believable workloads, because while it's easy to see that these algorithms win in the asymptotes, it's less clear that they win on realistic workloads.\r\n\r\nAlso, some of the \"composed\" algorithms have two parts -- one half is improved by this PR, and the other half isn't -- yet. For example in addUnchecked, we have two components: 1 builds setParentTransactions and the other calls UpdateParent on everything in setParentTransactions. Normally, building setParentTransactions is O(N log N), but with this update it becomes O(N). However, the *internals* of UpdateParent are  an ordered set, so we gain back the log N factor. However future work can update those data structures to make UpdateParent O(1).\r\n\r\nTo your point about making subtree detaching O(N), this work actually already does that moslty. removeRecursive was previously O(N log N), with this PR it is now basically O(N) (we skip the metadata updating in removeRecursive's call to RemoveStaged with updateDescendants = false, but removeUnchecked removes n items from a std::set so it regains a log(n) factor, but it's a pretty conceptually easy follow up PR to make txlinksMap a std::unordered_set).\r\n\r\nI haven't pushed the changes I was working on w.r.t. changing the std::sets to std::unordered_sets because while conceptually simple, they have a lot more edge case in if it will be better or worse (esp when it comes to memory). So the epoch's seemed like a better one as there's really no downside.",

This can cause us to propagate updates, worst case, to every transaction in the mempool.\r\n\r\nBecause we construct a `setEntries setChildren`, which is backed by a `std::set`, it is possible that this algorithm is `O(N log N)`.\r\n\r\nBy using an Epoch visitor pattern, we can limit this to `O(N)` worst case behavior.\r\n\r\nEpochs are also less resource intensive than almost any set option (e.g., hash set) because they are allocation free.\r\n\r\nThis PR is related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17268, it is a small subset of the changes which have been refactored slightly to ease review. If this PR gets review & merge, I will follow up with more PRs (similar to #17268) to improve the mempool ",

          "title": "Improve UpdateForDescendants by using Epochs and Removing CacheMap",
          "body": "This PR contains two refactors to the UpdateForDescendants method that could be stand alone, but I think are easiest to review together. This is follow up work from #17925 and a related to the work laid out in #17268.\r\n\r\nThe first change refactors UpdateForDescendants to use Epochs instead of sets to de-duplicate traversal, and replaces the cache entries with a vector instead of a set. This is a straightforward win. The algorithm is a bit clever so as not to require two separate vectors for txiters that need expanding and txiters that have already been processed, but I think it's relatively easy to reason about.\r\n\r\nThe second change removes the cache altogether, as it is not needed.\r\n\r\nThe cache was an optimization to limit re-traversal in UpdateForDescendants. But because we know that descendants limit limits the total number of descendants, this actually doesn't help that much. There are some common cases where having a CacheMap *might* be faster, but an adversary can trivially construct a worst-case example that causes equal behavior with or without a cachemap. For example, a transaction with N/2 children which each have N/2 outputs that get spent by N/2 grandchildren will cause the parent to iterate over N^2 entries with or without CacheMap. Post Epochs, UpdateForDescendants is sufficiently cheap such that the cachemap is just extra memory overhead.\r\n\r\nThis extra memory overhead isn't free, and my expectation is that getting rid of it should be faster in general. In an average case, we might expect not to have very deep long chains so we're allocating memory for little benefit.\r\n\r\nIt could be the case that the first commit causes a larger speed-up, because the upgraded cache vectors are much more efficient to build and iterate over. Then by removing them, we need to now go back to a traversal of std::sets for the MemPool children (before the first commit these cache lines were std::sets which are slow to iterate). However, we also eliminate the cache entry lookups, which are also slow, and get rid of a bunch of allocation. My guess is that it \"comes out in the wash\", and the new algorithm after both patches is superior to both the previous algorithm and the algorithm after only the first patch. The descendants limit comes into play helping feel comfortable with this: we know that the `vecEntries stage` can be no larger than the desendants limit (25), so we can bound how much traversals we'd do at 25*24.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a future work, the stage can become a cached epoch member (since we know we have the lock), so that this function does not need to allocate on each call, but this seemed like a minor improvement and invites some more discussion on if pre-allocating these scratchpads is a good idea.",

          "title": "Remove CTxMempool::mapLinks data structure member",
          "body": "Currently we have a peculiar data structure in the mempool called maplinks. Maplinks job is to track the in-pool children and parents of each transaction. This PR can be primarily understood and reviewed as a simple refactoring to remove this extra data structure, although it comes with a nice memory and performance improvement for free.\r\n\r\nMaplinks is particularly peculiar because removing it is not as simple as just moving it's inner structure to the owning CTxMempoolEntry. Because TxLinks (the class storing the setEntries for parents and children) store txiters to each entry in the mempool corresponding to the parent or child, it means that the TxLinks type is \"aware\" of the boost multiindex (mapTx) it's coming from, which is in turn, aware of the entry type stored in mapTx. Thus we used maplinks to store this entry associated data we in an entirely separate data structure just to avoid a circular type reference caused by storing a txiter inside a CTxMempoolEntry.\r\n\r\nIt turns out, we can kill this circular reference by making use of iterator_to multiindex function and std::reference_wrapper. This allows us to get rid of the maplinks data structure and move the ownership of the parents/child sets to the entries themselves.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this good all around, for any of the reasons given below the change would be acceptable, and it doesn't make the code harder to reason about or worse in any respect (as far as I can tell, there's no tradeoff).\r\n\r\n### Simpler ownership model \r\nNo longer having to consistency check that mapLinks did have records for our CTxMempoolEntry, impossible to have a mapLinks entry outlive or incorrectly die before a CTxMempoolEntry.\r\n\r\n### Memory Usage\r\nWe get rid of a O(Transactions) sized map in the mempool, which is a long lived data structure. \r\n\r\n### Performance\r\nIf you have a CTxMemPoolEntry, you immediately know the address of it's children/parents, rather than having to do a O(log(Transactions)) lookup via maplinks (which we do very often). We do it in *so many* places that a true benchmark has to look at a full running node, but it is easy enough to show an improvement in this case.\r\n\r\nThe ComplexMemPool shows a good coherence check that we see the expected result of it being 12.5% faster / 1.14x faster.\r\n```\r\nBefore:\r\n# Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median\r\nComplexMemPool, 5, 1, 1.40462, 0.277222, 0.285339, 0.279793\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n# Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median\r\nComplexMemPool, 5, 1, 1.22586, 0.243831, 0.247076, 0.244596\r\n```\r\nThe ComplexMemPool benchmark only checks doing addUnchecked and TrimToSize for 800 transactions. While this bench does a good job of hammering the relevant types of function, it doesn't test everything. \r\n\r\nSubbing in 5000 transactions shows a that the advantage isn't completely wiped out by other asymptotic factors (this isn't the only bottleneck in growing the mempool), but it's only a bit proportionally slower (10.8%, 1.12x), which adds evidence that this will be a good change for performance minded users.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median\r\nComplexMemPool, 5, 1, 59.1321, 11.5919, 12.235, 11.7068\r\n\r\n# Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median\r\nComplexMemPool, 5, 1, 52.1307, 10.2641, 10.5206, 10.4306\r\n```\r\nI don't think it's possible to come up with an example of where a maplinks based design would have better performance, but it's something for reviewers to consider.\r\n\r\n# Discussion\r\n## Why maplinks in the first place?\r\n\r\nI spoke with the author of mapLinks (sdaftuar) a while back, and my recollection from our conversation was that it was implemented because he did not know how to resolve the circular dependency at the time, and there was no other reason for making it a separate map.\r\n\r\n## Is iterator_to weird?\r\n\r\niterator_to is expressly for this purpose, see https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/indices.html#iterator_to \r\n\r\n>  iterator_to provides a way to retrieve an iterator to an element from a pointer to the element, thus making iterators and pointers interchangeable for the purposes of element pointing (not so for traversal) in many situations. This notwithstanding, it is not the aim of iterator_to to promote the usage of pointers as substitutes for real iterators: the latter are specifically designed for handling the elements of a container, and not only benefit from the iterator orientation of container interfaces, but are also capable of exposing many more programming bugs than raw pointers, both at compile and run time. iterator_to is thus meant to be used in scenarios where access via iterators is not suitable or desireable:\r\n> \r\n>     - Interoperability with preexisting APIs based on pointers or references.\r\n>     - Publication of pointer-based interfaces (for instance, when designing a C-compatible library).\r\n>     - The exposure of pointers in place of iterators can act as a type erasure barrier effectively decoupling the user of the code from the implementation detail of which particular container is being used. Similar techniques, like the famous Pimpl idiom, are used in large projects to reduce dependencies and build times.\r\n>     - Self-referencing contexts where an element acts upon its owner container and no iterator to itself is available.\r\n\r\nIn other words, iterator_to is the perfect tool for the job by the last reason given. Under the hood it should just be a simple pointer cast and have no major runtime overhead (depending on if the function call is inlined).\r\n\r\nEdit by laanwj: removed at sign from the description",
