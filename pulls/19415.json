          "body": "(chopped off from #19031 to ease review)\r\n\r\nBefore this change `CNetAddr::ip` was a fixed-size array of 16 bytes,\r\nnot being able to store larger addresses (e.g. TORv3) and encoded\r\nsmaller ones as 16-byte IPv6 addresses.\r\n\r\nChange its type to `prevector`, so that it can hold larger addresses and\r\ndo not disguise non-IPv6 addresses as IPv6. So the IPv4 address\r\n`1.2.3.4` is now encoded as `01020304` instead of\r\n`00000000000000000000FFFF01020304`.\r\n\r\nRename `CNetAddr::ip` to `CNetAddr::m_addr` because it is not an \"IP\" or\r\n\"IP address\" (TOR addresses are not IP addresses).\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve backward compatibility with serialization (where\r\ne.g. `1.2.3.4` is serialized as `00000000000000000000FFFF01020304`)\r\nintroduce `CNetAddr` dedicated legacy serialize/unserialize methods.\r\n\r\nAdjust `CSubNet` accordingly. Still use `CSubNet::netmask[]` of fixed 16\r\nbytes, but use the first 4 for IPv4 (not the last 4). Do not accept\r\ninvalid netmasks that have 0-bits followed by 1-bits and only allow\r\nsubnetting for IPv4 and IPv6.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Carl Dong <contact@carldong.me>",

This is problematic for several reasons:\r\n\r\n* It wastes disk space north of 20 GB, as all libraries and sanitizers are linked more than 150 times\r\n* It wastes CPU time, as the link step can practically not be cached (similar to ccache for object files)\r\n* It makes it a blocker to compile the fuzz tests by default for non-fuzz builds #19388, for the aforementioned reasons\r\n* The build file is several thousand lines of code, without doing anything meaningful except listing each fuzz target in a highly verbose manner\r\n* It makes writing new fuzz tests unnecessarily hard, as build system knowledge is required; Compare that to boost unit tests, which can be added by simply editing an existing cpp file\r\n* It encourages fuzz tests that re-use the `buffer` or assume the `buffer` to be concatenations of seeds, which increases complexity of seeds and complexity for the fuzz engine to explore; Thus reducing the effectiveness of the affected fuzz targets\r\n\r\nFixes #20088 ",

          "body": "Add I2P support by using the [I2P SAM](https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3) protocol. Unlike Tor, for incoming connections we get the I2P address of the peer (and they also receive ours when we are the connection initiator).\r\n\r\nTwo new options are added:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  -i2psam=<ip:port>\r\n       I2P SAM proxy to reach I2P peers and accept I2P connections (default:\r\n       none)\r\n\r\n  -i2pacceptincoming\r\n       If set and -i2psam is also set then incoming I2P connections are\r\n       accepted via the SAM proxy. If this is not set but -i2psam is set\r\n       then only outgoing connections will be made to the I2P network.\r\n       Ignored if -i2psam is not set. Notice that listening for incoming\r\n       I2P connections is done through the SAM proxy, not by binding to\r\n       a local address and port (default: true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Overview of the changes\r\n\r\n## Make `ReadBinary()` and `WriteBinary()` reusable\r\n\r\nWe would need to dump the I2P private key to a file and read it back later. Move those two functions out of `torcontrol.cpp`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nutil: extract {Read,Write}BinaryFile() to its own files\r\nutil: fix ReadBinaryFile() returning partial contents\r\nutil: fix WriteBinaryFile() claiming success even if error occurred\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Split `CConnman::AcceptConnection()`\r\n\r\nMost of `CConnman::AcceptConnection()` is agnostic of how the socket was accepted. The other part of it deals with the details of the `accept(2)` system call. Split those so that the protocol-agnostic part can be reused if we accept a socket by other means.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnet: check for invalid socket earlier in CConnman::AcceptConnection()\r\nnet: get the bind address earlier in CConnman::AcceptConnection()\r\nnet: isolate the protocol-agnostic part of CConnman::AcceptConnection()\r\nnet: avoid unnecessary GetBindAddress() call\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implement the I2P [SAM](https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3) protocol (not all of it)\r\n\r\nJust the parts that would enable us to make outgoing and accept incoming I2P connections.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnet: extend CNetAddr::SetSpecial() to support I2P\r\nnet: move the constant maxWait out of InterruptibleRecv()\r\nnet: dedup MSG_NOSIGNAL and MSG_DONTWAIT definitions\r\nnet: extend Sock::Wait() to report a timeout\r\nnet: extend Sock with methods for robust send & read until terminator\r\nnet: extend Sock with a method to check whether connected\r\nnet: implement the necessary parts of the I2P SAM protocol\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use I2P SAM to connect to and accept connections from I2P peers\r\n\r\nProfit from all of the preceding commits.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninit: introduce I2P connectivity options\r\nnet: add I2P to the reachability map\r\nnet: make outgoing I2P connections from CConnman\r\nnet: accept incoming I2P connections from CConnman\r\nnet: recognize I2P from ParseNetwork() so that -onlynet=i2p works\r\nnet: Do not skip the I2P network from GetNetworkNames()\r\n```",

We can avoid these (including in the incoming I2P code without further changes to it) by using ports with the correct type. The remaining conversions are pushed out to the user input boundaries where they can be range-checked and raise with user feedback in the next patch.",
