    "body": "This PR is a refactor only (i.e., any functional changes should be reported in review) which does the following:\r\n\r\n- Replace `state.DoS` with more descriptive calls where straightforward.  Rather than just call DoS or Invalid, different causes of invalidity have different functions. This makes it easier to quickly find all related causes of that class of error.\r\n- Convert all `nDoS` usage to an enum class with named levels (none 0, low 1, medium 10, elevated 20, high 50, and critical 100)\r\n- Use a custom enum class for reporting corruption to make it more clear where corruption occurs\r\n- return false directly from `CValidtationState` update call sites. state.DoS never returns true, so it makes it easier to see that the return value is not dependent on the call.\r\n- Don't pass `error()` as an argument to a function in DoS. error always returns false, and this is confusing for readers/reviewers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested, there's an unsquashed version too, but I figured this is simple enough to review squashed. \r\n\r\nThe only code quality 'decrease' is that some reject codes move from `validation.h` to `consensus/validation.h`. This abstraction barrier violation is already present (the `CValidationState` class is expected to handle those reject codes appropriately) so I think that this change is a lesser evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMotivation \r\n===\r\nI'm currently working on reworking the separation between reporting errors and DoS. As a first step in this process, I've cleaned up the interface without making any functional changes or major architecture changes. The resulting code should be easier to read and review changes to. The future plan to split `CValidationState` up into ~3 different subclasses (one to handle DoS, one to handle consensus correctness, and one to handle system errors) and then migrate the DoS completely to `net_processing.cpp`. This is a superior architecture because it better respects the boundaries between events on the network and faults in validation. I decided to start with this PR because I think it is an low hanging fruit immediate improvement independent of further modularization efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to @ryanofsky and @TheBlueMatt for feedback on an earlier version of this PR.",

          "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\n`BOOST_CHECK_THROW` merely checks that some `std::runtime_error` is\r\nthrown, but not which one.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how this can cause a test to pass when a developer\r\nintroduces a consensus bug. The test for the sigops limit assumes\r\nthat `CreateNewBlock` fails with `bad-blk-sigops`. However it can\r\nalso fail with bad-txns-vout-negative, if a naive developer lowers\r\n`BLOCKSUBSIDY` to `1*COIN`.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n`BOOST_CHECK_EXCEPTION` allows an additional predicate function. This\r\ncommit uses this for all exceptions that are checked for in\r\n`miner_tets.cpp`:\r\n* `bad-blk-sigops`\r\n* `bad-cb-multiple`\r\n* `bad-txns-inputs-missingorspent`\r\n* `block-validation-failed`\r\n\r\nIf the function throws a different error, the test will fail. Although the message produced by Boost is a bit [confusing](http://boost.2283326.n4.nabble.com/Test-BOOST-CHECK-EXCEPTION-error-message-still-vague-tt4683257.html#a4683554), it does show which error was actually thrown. Here's what the above `1*COIN` bug would result in:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1134\" alt=\"schermafbeelding 2017-09-02 om 23 42 29\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/29998976-815cabce-9038-11e7-9c46-f5f6cfb0ca7d.png\">\r\n \r\n## Other considerations\r\n\r\nA more elegant solution in my opinion would be to subclass `std::runtime_error` for each `INVALID_TRANSACTION` type, but this would involve touching consensus code.\r\n\r\nI put the predicates in `test_bitcoin.h` because I assume they can be reused in other test files. However [serialize_tests.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.15.0rc3/src/test/serialize_tests.cpp#L245) also uses `BOOST_CHECK_EXCEPTION` and it defines the predicate in the test file itself.\r\n\r\nInstead of four `IsRejectInvalidReasonX(std::runtime_error const& e)` functions, I'd prefer something reusable like `bool IsRejectInvalidReason(String reason)(std::runtime_error const& e)`, which would be used like `BOOST_CHECK_EXCEPTION(functionThatThrows(), std::runtime_error, IsRejectInvalidReason(\"bad-blk-sigops\")`. I couldn't figure out how to do that in C++.",

Instead, we replace CValidationState's nDoS and CorruptionPossible with a general ValidationInvalidReason, which net_processing can handle as it sees fit. I keep the behavior changes here to a minimum, but in the future we can utilize these changes for other smarter behavior, such as disconnecting/preferring to rotate outbound peers based on them providing things which are invalid due to SOFT_FORK because we shouldn't ban for such cases.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat complementary with, though obviously conflicts heavily with #11523, which added enums in place of DoS scores, as well as a few other cleanups (which are still relevant).\r\n\r\nCompared with previous bans, the following changes are made:\r\n * Txn with empty vin/vout or null prevouts move from 10 DoS\r\n   points to 100.\r\n * Loose transactions with a dependency loop now result in a ban\r\n   instead of 10 DoS points.\r\n * BIP68-violation no longer results in a ban as it is SOFT_FORK.\r\n * Non-SegWit SigOp violation no longer results in a ban as it\r\n   considers P2SH sigops and is thus SOFT_FORK.\r\n * Any script violation in a block no longer results in a ban as\r\n   it may be the result of a SOFT_FORK. This should likely be\r\n   fixed in the future by differentiating between them.\r\n * Proof of work failure moves from 50 DoS points to a ban.\r\n * Blocks with timestamps under MTP now result in a ban, blocks\r\n   too far in the future continue to *not* result in a ban.\r\n * Inclusion of non-final transactions in a block now results in a\r\n   ban instead of 10 DoS points.",

Imo returning from DoS as before is better as those extra lines have cost.\r\n* The CorruptionPossible enum/bool seems like a smell to me - if an enum is playing the role of a bool, why not a bool? If a bool isn’t clear, why not another construct?\r\n* I like the severity level enum\r\n* I don’t like that the severity param is buried as the last argument, IME severity make sense as a leading param or even the method name. Compare with log level apis.\r\n* I doubt making methods for each case is the way to go. There are a few independent variables here and ones with fewer, more stable values tend to make for better / more stable codebases. Consider severity or corruption / not corruption as alternatives.",

      "body": "@Empact, thanks for the review. \r\n\r\nThe motivation for the code changes I made is that the DoS code should eventually be *completely* relegated to a net_processing construct, whereas the _validity_ code should be handled in the validation. So the goal is to make the code in validation.h as abstract as possible and descriptive of what went wrong, providing a reason, rather than ascribing a Denial of Service level. \r\n\r\nThe extra lines for 'return false' don't have cost other than LoC, and the impact there is minimal. What they do help with is stricter modularization boundaries (should failure-reason code be returning information on validity?). Also returning a value from a function that always returns false is kind of stupid and makes the code harder to read.\r\n\r\nI'm indifferent on severity levels ordering.  \r\n\r\n",

          "body": "This is a rebase of #11639 with some fixes for the last few comments which were not yet addressed.\r\n\r\nThe original PR text, with some strikethroughs of text that is no longer correct:\r\n\r\n> This cleans up an old main-carryover - it made sense that main could decide what DoS scores to assign things because the DoS scores were handled in a different part of main, but now validation is telling net_processing what DoS scores to assign to different things, which is utter nonsense. Instead, we replace CValidationState's nDoS and CorruptionPossible with a general ValidationInvalidReason, which net_processing can handle as it sees fit. I keep the behavior changes here to a minimum, but in the future we can utilize these changes for other smarter behavior, such as disconnecting/preferring to rotate outbound peers based on them providing things which are invalid due to SOFT_FORK because we shouldn't ban for such cases.\r\n> \r\n> This is somewhat complementary with, though obviously conflicts heavily with #11523, which added enums in place of DoS scores, as well as a few other cleanups (which are still relevant).\r\n> \r\n> Compared with previous bans, the following changes are made:\r\n> \r\n> Txn with empty vin/vout or null prevouts move from 10 DoS\r\n> points to 100.\r\n> Loose transactions with a dependency loop now result in a ban\r\n> instead of 10 DoS points.\r\n> ~~BIP68-violation no longer results in a ban as it is SOFT_FORK.~~\r\n> ~~Non-SegWit SigOp violation no longer results in a ban as it\r\n> considers P2SH sigops and is thus SOFT_FORK.~~\r\n> ~~Any script violation in a block no longer results in a ban as\r\n> it may be the result of a SOFT_FORK. This should likely be\r\n> fixed in the future by differentiating between them.~~\r\n> Proof of work failure moves from 50 DoS points to a ban.\r\n> Blocks with timestamps under MTP now result in a ban, blocks\r\n> too far in the future continue to not result in a ban.\r\n> Inclusion of non-final transactions in a block now results in a\r\n> ban instead of 10 DoS points.\r\n\r\nNote: The change to ban all peers for consensus violations is actually NOT the change I'd like to make -- I'd prefer to only ban outbound peers in those situations.  The current behavior is a bit of a mess, however, and so in the interests of advancing this PR I tried to keep the changes to a minimum.  I plan to revisit the behavior in a followup PR.\r\n\r\nEDIT: One reviewer suggested I add some additional context for this PR:\r\n\r\n> The goal of this work was to make net_processing aware of the actual reasons for validation failures, rather than just deal with opaque numbers instructing it to do something.\r\n> \r\n> In the future, I'd like to make it so that we use more context to decide how to punish a peer. One example is to differentiate inbound and outbound peer misbehaviors. Another potential example is if we'd treat RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE failures differently (ie after the next consensus change is implemented), and perhaps again we'd want to treat some peers differently than others.",
