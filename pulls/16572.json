    "body": "In a few places in src/wallet/wallet.h, we use a char when semantically we want a bool.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of an issue because it means we can unserialize the same transaction with different fFromMe flags (as differing chars) and evaluate the following section in wallet/wallet.cpp\r\n```c++\r\n        if (wtxIn.fFromMe && wtxIn.fFromMe != wtx.fFromMe)\r\n         {\r\n             wtx.fFromMe = wtxIn.fFromMe;\r\n             fUpdated = true;\r\n         }\r\n```\r\nincorrectly (triggering an fUpdated where both fFromMe values represent true, via different chars).\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a vulnerability, but it's just a little messy and unsemantic, and could lead to issues with stored wtxIns not being findable in a map by their hash.\r\n\r\nThe serialize/unserialize code for bool internally uses a char, so it should be safe to make this substitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: Technically, this is a behavior change -- I haven't checked too closely that nowhere is depending on storing information in this char. Theoretically, this could break something because after this change a tx unserialized with such a char would preserve it's value, but now it is converted to a ~true~ canonical bool.",

Unless you can demonstrate specific performance improvements, where the (possible) compaction causes bottlenecks, I strongly disagree that this is a reason to go around refactoring things.\r\n\r\nFrom a developer angle `vector<bool>` is definitely less surprising to encounter (use bools for what should be bools) and unless there's a specific reason the compaction gets in the way (serialization voodoo ?), it shouldn't be a reason for concern at all.\r\n",
