See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

In our case that applies to the following calls:\n- `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create`\n- `secp256k1_keypair_create`\n- `secp256k1_ellswift_create`\n- `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign`\n- `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_recoverable`\n- `secp256k1_schnorrsig_sign32`\n- `ec_seckey_export_der` (not a direct secp256k1 function, but calls\n  `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create` inside)\n\nFor all the other secp256k1 calls we can simply use the static context.",

      "message": "coins: warn on oversized -dbcache\n\nOversized allocations can cause out-of-memory errors or [heavy swapping](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/issues/64#issuecomment-663637321), [grinding the system to a halt](https://x.com/murchandamus/status/1964432335849607224).\n\n`LogOversizedDbCache()` now emits a startup warning if the configured `-dbcache` exceeds a cap derived from system RAM, using the same parsing/clamping as cache sizing via CalculateDbCacheBytes(). This isn't meant as a recommended setting, rather a likely upper limit.\n\nNote that we're not modifying the set value, just issuing a warning.\nAlso note that the 75% calculation is rounded for the last two numbers since we have to divide first before multiplying, otherwise we wouldn't stay inside size_t on 32-bit systems - and this was simpler than casting back and forth.\n\nWe could have chosen the remaining free memory for the warning (e.g. warn if free memory is less than 1 GiB), but this is just a heuristic, we assumed that on systems with a lot of memory, other processes are also running, while memory constrained ones run only Core.\n\nIf total RAM < 2 GiB, cap is `DEFAULT_DB_CACHE` (`450 MiB`), otherwise it's 75% of total RAM.\nThe threshold is chosen to be close to values commonly used in [raspiblitz](https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz/blob/dev/home.admin/_provision.setup.sh#L98-L115) for common setups:\n\n| Total RAM | `dbcache` (MiB) | raspiblitz % | proposed cap (MiB) |\n|----------:|----------------:|-------------:|-------------------:|\n|     1 GiB |             512 |        50.0% |               450* |\n|     2 GiB |            1536 |        75.0% |               1536 |\n|     4 GiB |            2560 |        62.5% |               3072 |\n|     8 GiB |            4096 |        50.0% |               6144 |\n|    16 GiB |            4096 |        25.0% |              12288 |\n|    32 GiB |            4096 |        12.5% |              24576 |\n\n[Umbrel issues](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/issues/64#issuecomment-663816367) also mention 75% being the upper limit.\n\nStarting `bitcoind` on an 8 GiB rpi4b with a dbcache of 7 GiB:\n> ./build/bin/bitcoind -dbcache=7000\n\nwarns now as follows:\n```\n2025-09-07T17:24:29Z [warning] A 7000 MiB dbcache may be too large for a system memory of only 7800 MiB.\n2025-09-07T17:24:29Z Cache configuration:\n2025-09-07T17:24:29Z * Using 2.0 MiB for block index database\n2025-09-07T17:24:29Z * Using 8.0 MiB for chain state database\n2025-09-07T17:24:29Z * Using 6990.0 MiB for in-memory UTXO set (plus up to 286.1 MiB of unused mempool space)\n```\n\nBesides the [godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/EPsaE3xTj) reproducers for the new total memory method, we also tested the warnings manually on:\n- [x] Apple M4 Max, macOS 15.6.1\n- [x] Intel Core i9-9900K, Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n- [x] Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, Armbian Linux 6.12.22-current-bcm2711\n- [x] Intel Xeon x64, Windows 11 Home Version 24H2, OS Build 26100.4351\n\nCo-authored-by: stickies-v <stickies-v@protonmail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Hodlinator <172445034+hodlinator@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: w0xlt <woltx@protonmail.com>",

Fix this by reducing the iteration count in the `LIMITED_WHILE` loops.\n\n  This should help decrease the run time of the fuzz CI jobs.

For consistency, and to avoid an unnecessary upgrade, we should be setting this flag for migrated wallets.\n\n  The flag would end up being set anyways at the end of migration when the wallet is reloaded as it would perform the automatic upgrade at that time. However, this is unnecessary and we should just set it from the get go.\n\n  This PR also adds a couple tests to verify that the flag is being set, and that the upgrade is being performed.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  cedwies:\n    re-ACK 88b0647\n  rkrux:\n    lgtm ACK 88b0647f027a608acb61ec32329d19f8e5b0a9fd\n  pablomartin4btc:\n    ACK 88b0647f027a608acb61ec32329d19f8e5b0a9fd\n\nTree-SHA512: 7d0850db0ae38eedd1e6a3bfaa548c6c612182291059fb1a47279a4c4984ee7914ecd02d8c7e427ef67bf9f5e67cbc57a7ae4412fad539e1bf3e05c512a60d69\n",

For consistency, and to avoid an unnecessary upgrade, we should be setting this flag for migrated wallets.\n\n  The flag would end up being set anyways at the end of migration when the wallet is reloaded as it would perform the automatic upgrade at that time. However, this is unnecessary and we should just set it from the get go.\n\n  This PR also adds a couple tests to verify that the flag is being set, and that the upgrade is being performed.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  cedwies:\n    re-ACK 88b0647\n  rkrux:\n    lgtm ACK 88b0647f027a608acb61ec32329d19f8e5b0a9fd\n  pablomartin4btc:\n    ACK 88b0647f027a608acb61ec32329d19f8e5b0a9fd\n\nTree-SHA512: 7d0850db0ae38eedd1e6a3bfaa548c6c612182291059fb1a47279a4c4984ee7914ecd02d8c7e427ef67bf9f5e67cbc57a7ae4412fad539e1bf3e05c512a60d69",

See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33421/commits/c9530cf35d351628eea4992c66fc1df548d1b580.\n\n  This fix can be tested by cherry-picking the commits from #33421 without the static cast fix and running:\n\n  ```bash\n  echo \"AQAAAAAAA\n  AAnJycnAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\" | base64 --decode > miner.crash\n\n  FUZZ=block_template_cache ./build_fuzz/bin/fuzz miner.crash\n  ```\n\n  ---\n\n  This is part of a larger inconsistency in how size/weight is represented in the codebase. It may be worth defining a dedicated type for size/weight.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  glozow:\n    nice, utACK b807dfcdc5929c314d43b790c9e705d5bf0a86e8\n  furszy:\n    Code ACK b807dfcdc5929c314d43b790c9e705d5bf0a86e8\n\nTree-SHA512: c1d2f7e500f9b0624a4c22a146921a1644017065e6c94d0c5027486392321f5de26c61751a24765e025e45b34c535adfd6d0e2ac809dea6846b99f37d13043c9\n",

See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33421/commits/c9530cf35d351628eea4992c66fc1df548d1b580.\n\n  This fix can be tested by cherry-picking the commits from #33421 without the static cast fix and running:\n\n  ```bash\n  echo \"AQAAAAAAA\n  AAnJycnAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\" | base64 --decode > miner.crash\n\n  FUZZ=block_template_cache ./build_fuzz/bin/fuzz miner.crash\n  ```\n\n  ---\n\n  This is part of a larger inconsistency in how size/weight is represented in the codebase. It may be worth defining a dedicated type for size/weight.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  glozow:\n    nice, utACK b807dfcdc5929c314d43b790c9e705d5bf0a86e8\n  furszy:\n    Code ACK b807dfcdc5929c314d43b790c9e705d5bf0a86e8\n\nTree-SHA512: c1d2f7e500f9b0624a4c22a146921a1644017065e6c94d0c5027486392321f5de26c61751a24765e025e45b34c535adfd6d0e2ac809dea6846b99f37d13043c9",

The API docs hint to those by stating \"[(not secp256k1_context_static)](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/b4756543028065b3ae6f30e9e6d7f1ecf2bb08c6/include/secp256k1.h#L645)\" for the context parameter. In our case that applies to the following calls:\n  - `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create`\n  - `secp256k1_keypair_create`\n  - `secp256k1_ellswift_create`\n  - `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign`\n  - `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_recoverable`\n  - `secp256k1_schnorrsig_sign32`\n  - `ec_seckey_export_der` (not a direct secp256k1 function, but calls `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create` inside)\n\n  For all the other secp256k1 calls we can simply use the static context. This is done for consistency to other calls that already use `secp256k1_context_static`, and also to reduce dependencies on the global signing context variable. Looked closer at this in the course of reviewing #29675, where some functions used the signing context that didn't need to, avoiding a move to another module (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29675#discussion_r2333831377).\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  Eunovo:\n    ACK https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33399/commits/1ff9e929489e625a603e8755b8efe849feda1f16\n  furszy:\n    ACK 1ff9e929489e625a603e8755b8efe849feda1f16\n  rkrux:\n    crACK 1ff9e929489e625a603e8755b8efe849feda1f16\n\nTree-SHA512: f091efa56c358057828f3455d4ca9ce40ec0d35f3e38ab147fe3928bb5dbf7ffbc27dbf97b71937828ab95ea4e9be5f96d89a2d29e2aa18df4542aae1b33e258\n",

The API docs hint to those by stating \"[(not secp256k1_context_static)](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/b4756543028065b3ae6f30e9e6d7f1ecf2bb08c6/include/secp256k1.h#L645)\" for the context parameter. In our case that applies to the following calls:\n  - `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create`\n  - `secp256k1_keypair_create`\n  - `secp256k1_ellswift_create`\n  - `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign`\n  - `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_recoverable`\n  - `secp256k1_schnorrsig_sign32`\n  - `ec_seckey_export_der` (not a direct secp256k1 function, but calls `secp256k1_ec_pubkey_create` inside)\n\n  For all the other secp256k1 calls we can simply use the static context. This is done for consistency to other calls that already use `secp256k1_context_static`, and also to reduce dependencies on the global signing context variable. Looked closer at this in the course of reviewing #29675, where some functions used the signing context that didn't need to, avoiding a move to another module (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29675#discussion_r2333831377).\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  Eunovo:\n    ACK https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33399/commits/1ff9e929489e625a603e8755b8efe849feda1f16\n  furszy:\n    ACK 1ff9e929489e625a603e8755b8efe849feda1f16\n  rkrux:\n    crACK 1ff9e929489e625a603e8755b8efe849feda1f16\n\nTree-SHA512: f091efa56c358057828f3455d4ca9ce40ec0d35f3e38ab147fe3928bb5dbf7ffbc27dbf97b71937828ab95ea4e9be5f96d89a2d29e2aa18df4542aae1b33e258",

(amisha)\n\nPull request description:\n\n  **Description**\n  From what I deciphered reading the line https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/macdeploy/macdeployqtplus#L390 is that qt translations are optional to have hence we should be able to build without it but the case where the flag translations_dir falls back to its default Null value it raises this error.\n\n  The config comments also mentioned that adding translation file is optional.\n\n  ```\n  ./macdeployqtplus --help\n  usage: macdeployqtplus [-h] [-verbose [VERBOSE]] [-no-plugins] [-no-strip] [-translations-dir path] [-zip zip] app-bundle\n\n  Improved version of macdeployqt. Outputs a ready-to-deploy app in a folder \"dist\" and optionally wraps it in a .zip file. Note, that the \"dist\" folder will be deleted before deploying on each run. Optionally, Qt translation files\n  (.qm) can be added to the bundle.\n  ```\n\n  **Steps to reproduce**\n  So I was following the general steps to set up app on macos however I didn't download any qt translations presuming it was optional from the comment linkedin in PR, so to reproduce if you have translation directories in place ull need to delete them and then try to build the file, otherwise don't download it at all and try to build it. It should fail on that flag as translations dir was never downloaded.\n\n  **Approach taken**\n  I have moved the code which adds language files under the if statement that first checks if the value of the flag is not Null before referencing it.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  ismaelsadeeq:\n    ACK 7b5261f7ef3d88361204c40eb10c0d9dc44f5ed7\n\nTree-SHA512: 8d51b17569e42c9feb95e1be17b1551c708a05eb44b82c74db0b25e07006b4ee223d64484f8bdb2ee1420f6e571686561ae1c09bd3362f77dcbb507bc5085f86\n",

(amisha)\n\nPull request description:\n\n  **Description**\n  From what I deciphered reading the line https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/macdeploy/macdeployqtplus#L390 is that qt translations are optional to have hence we should be able to build without it but the case where the flag translations_dir falls back to its default Null value it raises this error.\n\n  The config comments also mentioned that adding translation file is optional.\n\n  ```\n  ./macdeployqtplus --help\n  usage: macdeployqtplus [-h] [-verbose [VERBOSE]] [-no-plugins] [-no-strip] [-translations-dir path] [-zip zip] app-bundle\n\n  Improved version of macdeployqt. Outputs a ready-to-deploy app in a folder \"dist\" and optionally wraps it in a .zip file. Note, that the \"dist\" folder will be deleted before deploying on each run. Optionally, Qt translation files\n  (.qm) can be added to the bundle.\n  ```\n\n  **Steps to reproduce**\n  So I was following the general steps to set up app on macos however I didn't download any qt translations presuming it was optional from the comment linkedin in PR, so to reproduce if you have translation directories in place ull need to delete them and then try to build the file, otherwise don't download it at all and try to build it. It should fail on that flag as translations dir was never downloaded.\n\n  **Approach taken**\n  I have moved the code which adds language files under the if statement that first checks if the value of the flag is not Null before referencing it.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  ismaelsadeeq:\n    ACK 7b5261f7ef3d88361204c40eb10c0d9dc44f5ed7\n\nTree-SHA512: 8d51b17569e42c9feb95e1be17b1551c708a05eb44b82c74db0b25e07006b4ee223d64484f8bdb2ee1420f6e571686561ae1c09bd3362f77dcbb507bc5085f86",

      "message": "coins: fix `cachedCoinsUsage` accounting to prevent underflow\n\nMove the `cachedCoinsUsage` subtract in `AddCoin()` to after the `possible_overwrite` check.\nPreviously a throw before assignment decremented the counter without changing the entry, which corrupted accounting and later underflowed.\n\nIn `Flush()`, reset `cachedCoinsUsage` to `0` only when `BatchWrite()` succeeds and `cacheCoins` is actually cleared. In production `BatchWrite()` returns `true`, so this mostly affects tests. On failure, leave the counter unchanged to keep it in sync with the cache.\n\nThe existing `Flush()` workaround in fuzzing was also removed now that the source of the problem was fixed, so the fuzzer no longer needs `coins_view_cache.Flush()` to realign `cachedCoinsUsage` after an exception.\nReplace the prior `expected_code_path` tracking with direct assertions. The role of the variable was to verify that code execution follows only expected paths, either successful addition, or if it's an exception, the message is verified and checked that overwrite was disallowed.\n\nWith these changes the counter stays consistent across success and exception paths, so we can finally remove the `UBSan` suppressions for `CCoinsViewCache` that were masking the issue.\n\nIncluded a unit test as well, attempting to add a different coin to the same outpoint without allowing overwrites and make sure it throws.\nWe use `SelfTest()` to validates accounting, and check that the cache remains usable.\n\nCo-authored-by: Ryan Ofsky <ryan@ofsky.org>\nCo-authored-by: w0xlt <woltx@protonmail.com>",

Finally, it exposes a function `GetMainMemoryUsage()` to compute `TxGraph`'s approximate memory usage.\n\n  It makes the `Cluster` type abstract, with two instances (`SingletonClusterImpl` for 1-transaction clusters, and `GenericClusterImpl` for others).\n\n  On my 64-bit system, I obtain the following numbers:\n  * `SingletonClusterImpl`: 48 bytes, plus 16 bytes malloc overhead in its `unique_ptr`, plus 8-byte pointer in `m_clusters`\n  * `GenericClusterImpl`: 104 bytes, plus 16 bytes malloc overhead in its `unique_ptr`, plus 8-byte pointer in `m_clusters`, plus 72 bytes malloc overhead inside its vectors and `DepGraph`, plus 40 bytes per transaction in those.\n  * `TxGraphImpl::Entry`: 72 bytes per transaction\n  * `TxGraphImpl::ChunkData`: 8 bytes, plus 56 bytes in `std::set` overhead + malloc overhead, all per chunk.\n  * `TxGraph::Ref`: 16 bytes per transaction\n\n  This overall amounts to 200 bytes per cluster, plus 64 bytes per chunk, plus 128 bytes per transaction, but only 224 bytes overall per singleton cluster.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  l0rinc:\n    code review reACK 023cd5a5469ad61205bf7bb1135895f2b4a20ea9\n  instagibbs:\n    reACK 023cd5a5469ad61205bf7bb1135895f2b4a20ea9\n  ismaelsadeeq:\n    reACK 023cd5a5469ad61205bf7bb1135895f2b4a20ea9  🚢\n  glozow:\n    reACK 023cd5a5469ad61205bf7bb1135895f2b4a20ea9\n\nTree-SHA512: c957b27f47318be7c25d71453df2ae9d4e7bf21dab13b6e5e975cca122a221a99b15c584872491225785d276a9165f090675ee0f4460a2775bd3271933e3b246\n",

Finally, it exposes a function `GetMainMemoryUsage()` to compute `TxGraph`'s approximate memory usage.\n\n  It makes the `Cluster` type abstract, with two instances (`SingletonClusterImpl` for 1-transaction clusters, and `GenericClusterImpl` for others).\n\n  On my 64-bit system, I obtain the following numbers:\n  * `SingletonClusterImpl`: 48 bytes, plus 16 bytes malloc overhead in its `unique_ptr`, plus 8-byte pointer in `m_clusters`\n  * `GenericClusterImpl`: 104 bytes, plus 16 bytes malloc overhead in its `unique_ptr`, plus 8-byte pointer in `m_clusters`, plus 72 bytes malloc overhead inside its vectors and `DepGraph`, plus 40 bytes per transaction in those.\n  * `TxGraphImpl::Entry`: 72 bytes per transaction\n  * `TxGraphImpl::ChunkData`: 8 bytes, plus 56 bytes in `std::set` overhead + malloc overhead, all per chunk.\n  * `TxGraph::Ref`: 16 bytes per transaction\n\n  This overall amounts to 200 bytes per cluster, plus 64 bytes per chunk, plus 128 bytes per transaction, but only 224 bytes overall per singleton cluster.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  l0rinc:\n    code review reACK 023cd5a5469ad61205bf7bb1135895f2b4a20ea9\n  instagibbs:\n    reACK 023cd5a5469ad61205bf7bb1135895f2b4a20ea9\n  ismaelsadeeq:\n    reACK 023cd5a5469ad61205bf7bb1135895f2b4a20ea9  🚢\n  glozow:\n    reACK 023cd5a5469ad61205bf7bb1135895f2b4a20ea9\n\nTree-SHA512: c957b27f47318be7c25d71453df2ae9d4e7bf21dab13b6e5e975cca122a221a99b15c584872491225785d276a9165f090675ee0f4460a2775bd3271933e3b246",

Since secnonces must not be used, this class has no serialization and will only live in memory. A restart of the software will require a restart of the MuSig2 signing process.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  fjahr:\n    tACK ac599c4a9cb3b2d424932d3fd91f9eed17426827\n  rkrux:\n    lgtm tACK ac599c4a9cb3b2d424932d3fd91f9eed17426827\n  theStack:\n    Code-review ACK ac599c4a9cb3b2d424932d3fd91f9eed17426827 :old_key:\n\nTree-SHA512: 626b9adc42ed2403e2f4405321eb9ce009a829c07d968e95ab288fe4940b195b0af35ca279a4a7fa51af76e55382bad6f63a23bca14a84140559b3c667e7041e",

The issues stemmed from incorrect decrement timing in `AddCoin()`, unconditional reset in `Flush()` on failure, and incorrect increment in `EmplaceCoinInternalDANGER()` when insertion fails.\n\n  ### Problems Fixed\n\n  **1. `AddCoin()` underflow on exception**\n  - Previously decremented `cachedCoinsUsage` *before* the `possible_overwrite` validation\n  - If validation threw, the map entry remained unchanged but counter was decremented\n  - This corrupted accounting and later caused underflow\n  - **Impact**: Test-only in current codebase, but unsound accounting that could affect future changes\n\n  **2. `Flush()` accounting drift on failure**\n  - Unconditionally reset `cachedCoinsUsage` to 0, even when `BatchWrite()` failed\n  - Left the map populated while the counter read zero\n  - **Impact**: Test-only (production `BatchWrite()` returns `true`), but broke accounting consistency\n\n  **3. Cursor redundant usage tracking**\n  - `CoinsViewCacheCursor::NextAndMaybeErase()` subtracted usage when erasing spent entries\n  - However, `SpendCoin()` already decremented and cleared the `scriptPubKey`, leaving `DynamicMemoryUsage()` at 0\n  - **Impact**: Redundant code that obscured actual accounting behavior\n\n  **4. `EmplaceCoinInternalDANGER()` double-counting**\n  - Incremented `cachedCoinsUsage` even when `try_emplace` did not insert (duplicate key)\n  - Inflated the counter on duplicate attempts\n  - **Impact**: Mostly test-reachable (AssumeUTXO doesn't overwrite in production), but incorrect accounting\n\n  ### Testing\n\n  To reproduce the historical UBSan failures on the referenced baseline and to verify the fix, run:\n  ```\n  MAKEJOBS=\"-j$(nproc)\" FILE_ENV=\"./ci/test/00_setup_env_native_fuzz.sh\" ./ci/test_run_all.sh\n  ```\n\n  The change was tested with the related unit and fuzz test, and asserted before/after each `cachedCoinsUsage` change (in production code and fuzz) that the calculations are still correct by recalculating them from scratch.\n\n  <details>\n  <summary>Details</summary>\n\n  ```C++\n  bool CCoinsViewCache::CacheUsageValid() const\n  {\n      size_t actual{0};\n      for (auto& entry : cacheCoins | std::views::values) actual += entry.coin.DynamicMemoryUsage();\n      return actual == cachedCoinsUsage;\n  }\n  ```\n  or\n  ```patch\n  diff --git a/src/coins.cpp b/src/coins.cpp\n  --- a/src/coins.cpp(revision fd3b1a7f4bb2ac527f23d4eb4cfa40a3215906e5)\n  +++ b/src/coins.cpp(revision 872a05633bfdbd06ad82190d7fe34b42d13ebfe9)\n  @@ -96,6 +96,7 @@\n           fresh = !it->second.IsDirty();\n       }\n       if (!inserted) {\n  +        Assert(cachedCoinsUsage >= it->second.coin.DynamicMemoryUsage());\n           cachedCoinsUsage -= it->second.coin.DynamicMemoryUsage();\n       }\n       it->second.coin = std::move(coin);\n  @@ -133,6 +134,7 @@\n   bool CCoinsViewCache::SpendCoin(const COutPoint &outpoint, Coin* moveout) {\n       CCoinsMap::iterator it = FetchCoin(outpoint);\n       if (it == cacheCoins.end()) return false;\n  +    Assert(cachedCoinsUsage >= it->second.coin.DynamicMemoryUsage());\n       cachedCoinsUsage -= it->second.coin.DynamicMemoryUsage();\n       TRACEPOINT(utxocache, spent,\n              outpoint.hash.data(),\n  @@ -226,10 +228,12 @@\n               if (itUs->second.IsFresh() && it->second.coin.IsSpent()) {\n                   // The grandparent cache does not have an entry, and the coin\n                   // has been spent.

On `master` the failure can be seen in https://github.com/l0rinc/bitcoin-core-nightly/pull/2\n\n  before:\n  https://github.com/l0rinc/bitcoin-core-nightly/actions/runs/18327936488/job/52196728885?pr=2\n\n  <details>\n  <summary>Details</summary>\n\n  ```\n  /home/runner/work/bitcoin-core-nightly/bitcoin-core-nightly/src/randomenv.cpp:61:15: warning: '__p__environ' redeclared without 'dllimport' attribute: previous 'dllimport' ignored [-Winconsistent-dllimport]\n     61 | extern char** environ; // NOLINT(readability-redundant-declaration): Necessary on some platforms\n        |               ^\n  /home/runner/work/bitcoin-core-nightly/bitcoin-core-nightly/llvm_mingw_toolchain/aarch64-w64-mingw32/include/stdlib.h:656:17: note: expanded from macro 'environ'\n    656 | #define environ _environ\n        |                 ^\n  /home/runner/work/bitcoin-core-nightly/bitcoin-core-nightly/llvm_mingw_toolchain/aarch64-w64-mingw32/include/stdlib.h:225:21: note: expanded from macro '_environ'\n    225 | #define _environ (* __p__environ())\n        |                     ^\n  /home/runner/work/bitcoin-core-nightly/bitcoin-core-nightly/llvm_mingw_toolchain/aarch64-w64-mingw32/include/stdlib.h:221:27: note: previous declaration is here\n    221 |   _CRTIMP char ***__cdecl __p__environ(void);\n        |                           ^\n  /home/runner/work/bitcoin-core-nightly/bitcoin-core-nightly/llvm_mingw_toolchain/aarch64-w64-mingw32/include/stdlib.h:221:3: note: previous attribute is here\n    221 |   _CRTIMP char ***__cdecl __p__environ(void);\n        |   ^\n  /home/runner/work/bitcoin-core-nightly/bitcoin-core-nightly/llvm_mingw_toolchain/aarch64-w64-mingw32/include/_mingw.h:52:40: note: expanded from macro '_CRTIMP'\n     52 | #      define _CRTIMP  __attribute__ ((__dllimport__))\n        |                                        ^\n  1 warning generated.\n  ```\n\n  </details>\n\n  after:\n  https://github.com/l0rinc/bitcoin-core-nightly/actions/runs/18329616268/job/52201940831?pr=4\n\n  <details>\n  <summary>Details</summary>\n\n  ```\n  [ 28%] Building CXX object src/util/CMakeFiles/bitcoin_util.dir/__/randomenv.cpp.obj\n  ```\n\n  </details>\n\n  Note that there are some other remaining warnings in the logs that will be fixed in separate PRs\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  sipa:\n    utACK 9610b0d1e28aeda02a2ddcf1f0591ae577c3e88e if this makes the compilers happy\n  laanwj:\n    Code review ACK 9610b0d1e28aeda02a2ddcf1f0591ae577c3e88e\n  hebasto:\n    re-ACK 9610b0d1e28aeda02a2ddcf1f0591ae577c3e88e.\n\nTree-SHA512: a9e39d288b663ed24cbbbae228850e6f02d417d8781a3ac3d0b3db0b7ff734bbd62fddb9f57b8f77daab4e9c016ff66906ebc5fb2de7635ef539ef7f4dc2eaba",

This helps fine tune the memory consumption per `HeadersSyncState`-instance in the face of malicious peers.\n\n  (The `REDOWNLOAD_BUFFER_SIZE`/`HEADER_COMMITMENT_PERIOD` ratio determines how many Headers Sync commitment bits must match between PRESYNC & REDOWNLOAD phases before we start permanently storing headers from a peer. For more details see comments in *src/headerssync.h* and *contrib/devtools/headerssync-params.py*).\n\n  ### Problem: Not feeding back headers until completing sync\n\n  During v30 release process #33274 made `REDOWNLOAD_BUFFER_SIZE` exceed the `target_blocks` constant used to control the length of chains generated for testing Headers Sync (`15000`, *headers_sync_chainwork_tests.cpp*).\n\n  The `HeadersSyncState::m_redownloaded_headers`-buffer now does not reach the `REDOWNLOAD_BUFFER_SIZE`-threshold during those unit tests. As a consequence `HeadersSyncState::PopHeadersReadyForAcceptance()` will not start feeding back headers until the PoW threshold has been met. While this will not cause the unit test to start failing on master, it means we have gone from testing behavior that resembles mainnet (way more than `REDOWNLOAD_BUFFER_SIZE` headers to reach the PoW limit), to behavior that is not possible/expected there.\n\n  ### Solution\n\n  Avoid testing this unrealistic condition of completing Headers Sync before reaching `REDOWNLOAD_BUFFER_SIZE` by making tests able to define their own values through the new `HeadersSyncParams` instead of having them hard-coded for all chains & tests.\n\n  ### Commits\n\n  * First 6 commits refactor and improve the unit tests in order to clarify latter changes.\n  * We then add checks for the behavior around the `REDOWNLOAD_BUFFER_SIZE` threshold.\n  * The main change: we extract the section from *headerssync.cpp* containing the constants to *kernel/chainparams.cpp*, making `HeadersSyncState` no longer hard-coded to mainnet.\n\n  ### Notes\n\n  This PR used to be called \"headerssync: Preempt unrealistic unit test behavior\".\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  l0rinc:\n    reACK cc5dda1de333cf7aa10e2237ee2c9221f705dbd9\n  marcofleon:\n    code review ACK cc5dda1de333cf7aa10e2237ee2c9221f705dbd9\n  danielabrozzoni:\n    reACK cc5dda1de333cf7aa10e2237ee2c9221f705dbd9\n\nTree-SHA512: ccc824dcbbb8ad5ae98c3bf5808b38467aac0230739898a758c9b939eecd74f982df088fa0ba81cc1c1732f19a607b135a6e9577bb9fcf7f8570567ce92f66e6\n",

For better fuzzing of it, it would be great to have these values/interactions.
