    "body": "When a wallet is automatically upgraded, we always do so in a way that allows the user to load their wallet in an older version. When the user loads their wallet into an upgraded version again, the wallet may not perform the automatic upgrade and end up with upgraded and non-upgraded material in the wallet.\r\n\r\nIf we write some information about the last client to open the wallet, we would be able to detect these upgrade-downgrade-upgrade situations and perform another upgrade if so. However, in order for this to work, we need to have implemented writing such information into versions prior to the ones which introduce new automatic upgrades.\r\n\r\nWe are already writing the CLIENT_VERSION into all wallets in a \"version\" record, although this record is not updated in the same way across all previous versions. Since v24.0, we are always updating the record when the client version differs, but prior to that, the record would only be updated when the client version is newer. Even so, we can use this record to store the last client version.\r\n\r\nThe first commit decouples the written client version from the node version. This aids in development of new features. The version is entirely decoupled from previous versions by requiring all versions to have bit 30 set, and the initial version being `0 | (1 << 30)`. The versions just need to be at least 299900, and forcing bit 30 to be set was an easy way to achieve this.\r\n\r\nHowever, using version numbers is not as flexible as feature flags, so the second commit introduces the concept of Wallet Client Features. These flags are distinct from the existing Wallet Feature Flags since they are conceptually different. These are written in a separate record, and the wallet client version is incremented to `(1 << 0) | (1 << 30)`.\r\n\r\nLastly, since some upgrades may need private keys and can only occur after the wallet is decrypted, the third commit also adds a last decrypted features flags record to record the features of the last client to decrypt the wallet.\r\n\r\nThe result is that we will now be able to detect a downgrade down to v24.0 and be able to implement in parallel multiple features that require automatic upgrades.",

I know that running from the master branch is not supported and devs will have to deal with un-upgraded material themselves, but it seems easy to fix (and cleaner) to just introduce a new variable in the wallet that is equal to the current `CLIENT_VERSION` and then handle it separately and explicitly from now on.",

      "body": "Concept ACK. It shouldn't hurt to add more metadata to help detect when there might be a mix of old data in a newer format and new data in an older format in the same wallet.\r\n\r\nConceptually, I think we could always detect these cases by just scanning the entire wallet for data that needs to be upgraded on loading. But having this extra metadata is nice because it can avoid slowing down wallet loading by avoiding unnecessary upgrade rescans.\r\n\r\nOn the approach in e94ef51837daa5ec9552eb14e8ccc38d1b82b65b, I think it is ok, but would suggest some ways it might be improved:\r\n\r\n- I agree with Marco's [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32895#issuecomment-3048078577) that it would be great to move away from CLIENT_VERSION and use something independent of the node version.\r\n  - A downside of this suggestion is that the PR might not be able to reuse the existing VERSION field and might need to introduce 2 new fields instead of 1. I think the tradeoff could be worth it though.\r\n- It would be nice to avoid version numbers altogether and use feature flags instead, defining new feature flags when new data fields are introduced, and writing supported feature flags to LAST_OPENED_FEATURES & LAST_DECRYPTED_FEATURES fields on wallet loading.\r\n  - This would not require introducing a new data type since we already have a [WalletFlags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/927055e42afbfd998b5d85108e9c5fe7c6ffb7aa/src/wallet/walletutil.h#L36-L78) enum. New internal and external features could just be new (nonmandatory) `WalletFlags` values.\r\n  - IMO, flags are better than version numbers because they decouple code that implements new features from the merge and release process. They also make code more readable and maintainable because checks like `if (last_opened_supported_specific_feature_x)` are more obvious than `if (last_opened_version > some_version_number_with_collection_of_features)`\r\n- I assume we don't care about detecting upgrades & downgrades to versions before v24.0 which wouldn't overwrite the `VERSION` field on opening. But if we did, it'd be possible to detect this by writing last_opened and last_decrypted metadata to a file alongside the wallet database instead of inside the wallet database, and touching the file whenever the database is flushed. This way, if the database file modification time was greater than metadata file modification time, you could infer that the database had been loaded by an older version in the meantime and needs to be upgraded. Wouldn't recommend this approach because it is more complicated, but wanted to mention it as an alternative to introducing new database fields.",

The detection only works because of older versions overwriting the field with their CLIENT_VERSION. Introducing a new field now means that we cannot detect when an upgraded wallet was opened in any version older than v30.0 (assuming this is merged for the next release). The timeline would be too soon for any newly introduced features in say v31.0 or v32.0 (and I've got a few things in mind already that would utilize this). I'm already not particularly thrilled by the fact that the current implementation can only detect down to 24.0 as I expect that users doing upgrade-downgrade-upgrade with even older versions is commonplace.\r\n\r\n> Conceptually, I think we could always detect these cases by just scanning the entire wallet for data that needs to be upgraded on loading.\r\n\r\nI don't think that is actually viable as it would largely end up performing the upgrade on all loads regardless of whether the upgrade has already been done.",

It also writes out a set of client specific feature flags into two new records: `lastopenedfeatures` and `lastdecryptedfeatures`. However, these feature flags are separate from the existing wallet feature flags.\r\n\r\nI believe this preserves the behavior of detecting downgrades down to v24.0, while also giving us the flexibility of a new field and feature flags.",
