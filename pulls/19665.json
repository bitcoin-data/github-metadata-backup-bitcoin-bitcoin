    "body": "This change is related to a whitepaper I submitted privately to ZmnSCPxj, and this PR is by his request.\r\n\r\nChanges in this pr:\r\n- Updated the protocol layer to accept a competing chain of the same height so that it's fitness can be tested.\r\n- Updated the verification layer to incorporate a block fitness test to resolve disagreements.\r\n- Introduced an uint256-bit addition operator to support the block fitness test.\r\n \r\n---\r\nWhen forming a Nakamoto Consensus, two competing chains of equal length can presented to the network. Nodes within the network see these two chains authoritative equals, and a disagreement forms on which is the authoritative equal.  Floating-Point Nakamoto Consensus introduces a method of disagreement resolution by setting up a kind of relay-race - where the winning team’s strength is carried forward.   This design is intended to cement the lead of the winner and to greatly incentivize the network to adopt the dominant chain no matter how many valid solutions are advertised, or what order they arrive.\r\n\r\nThe first step in this new algorithm is that a node in the network should continue to conduct traditional Nakamoto Consensus, but If at any point there are two solution blocks advertised for the same height - then the more-fit block is chosen as the winner which is then propagated to neighbors.  It is in the best interest of all miners to adopt the most-fit block, failing to do so risks wasting resources on a mining a block that would be discarded.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a decentralized solution, this kind of agreement must be empirically derived from the existing proof-of-work so that it is identically verifiable by all nodes on the network.  Additionally, this fitness evaluation needs to ensure that no two competing solutions can be numerically equivalent.\r\n",

This does introduce the possibility of intentionally replacing a single block - but in order to do so the adversarial miner must expend more energy than what is required to simply create a new block.   The built-in network incentives come into the defender's advantage.\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Aug 5, 2020 at 12:23 AM MarcoFalke <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> requries an adversary to generate\r\n>\r\n> It doesn't require the adversary to generate such a pow, when it is\r\n> expected to happen by chance eventually.
