    "body": "This PR brings back and builds on #17094. GitHub uses a CODEOWNERS magic file to automatically add tagged contributors to the \"Reviewers\" list for a PR.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this is to make use of GitHub's suggested reviewers feature and not to confer ownership or give veto power to specific people. It would be better if this file could be named CODEREVIEWERS, but alas, that wouldn't work. The idea of a NAGFILE was proposed in [Bitcoin Core Dev meeting in 2018](https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-03-07-priorities/#:~:text=NAGFILE). While this GitHub implementation has some complications, it's a step towards realizing the promise of automating \"reviewing begging\" and (hopefully) positively impacting the review process as a whole.\r\n\r\nOf secondary value, this file can serve as documentation for who the maintainers are and who it might be smart to check with for certain areas of code/features (i.e., fuzzing, PSBT, and Bech32) -- this is helpful information for new contributors.\r\n\r\n* The first commit is taken from #17094\r\n* The second commit adds comments and expands the list of reviewers based on the suggestions and comments from that PR\r\n* ~The third WIP commit~ This commit also uses the doc dir as an example of granular assignments based on lines of codes ~contributed~ written and/or general engagement with the project. (If interested, here is a report for [most lines of code per author for each file](https://gist.github.com/adamjonas/854a46a1918224927b186865baeac411)). The pro of this level of detail is that the best reviewer is more likely to be nominated. The con is that it will create churn as files are renamed, new files are added, or reviewers want to be added or removed.\r\n\r\nSome open questions:\r\n* How often should this file be changed?\r\n* What level of history does one need have on the project before being added to this file? When does it make sense to remove a reviewer?\r\n* These review notifications can [cause a lot of noise](https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/Team-based-notifications-or-rework-CODEOWNERS-notification/td-p/7811) and automatically subscribes the requested reviewer to the thread. A GitHub Team based approach would allow for adding or removing reviewers without modifying this file; however, this comes along with its [own set of problems](https://bionic.fullstory.com/taming-github-codeowners-with-bots/#problems-with-github-code-owners), including granting [write access](https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/CODEOWNERS-works-with-users-but-not-teams/td-p/4986#U4991). Other projects [have used bots](https://bionic.fullstory.com/taming-github-codeowners-with-bots/#using-a-github-bot) to sidestep this.",

Review time spent on the codebase and willingness to invest time reviewing a particular PR may both be factors as well, but which would not be accounted for. Also, PRs can be improved by repeated rounds of reviewing but in the end only the PR author is taken into account in the LOC stats. It may be good for these factors to be stated if this file is intended to be a reference for new contributors. A final question is if the updating and maintainance effort would be worth the value added.",

I'd like to be added (in this PR or after) as a reviewer for src/interfaces/, and probably a few other places too like src/util/settings/.\r\n\r\nOn the concept, I think it's a potentially promising experiment. We'll have to see how it works and how people change the file and use the feature to match their preferences. Maybe it will even encourage less monolithic code organization and breaking up giant files like wallet.cpp into modules that people want to receive review requests for. In past projects, I've found systems for tracking review requests very useful, not just as a guide for what to review next, but also for requesting reviewers I might not have thought of, and for steering new requests away from people who are already overloaded with too many existing ones",

My biggest concern with this would be that a reviewer that is added to a PR might be a bottleneck. There just needs to be clarity that maintainers don't need to wait for their reviews when something is RFM and if the automatically added reviewers don't have the time or feel they are not the right person they remove themselves. So good job on clarifying what this is and what it isn't!",

The purpose of this proposal is to encourage peer review, so it's an error on my part if my wording misses the mark. I agree LOC may not be a great metric and will lead to [some poor initial tagging](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18949#discussion_r424598442), but it's an easy way to get up and running. Open to other metrics or suggestions as well.\r\n\r\n@ryanofsky\r\nI've added you to the file for the requested files/dirs (and thanks for the encouragement).\r\n\r\n@ariard \r\nI'm missing where the suggestion is made to subscribe by labels. I don't think that's possible without a bot, but GitHub teams come native to the feature.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke \r\nHappy to remove anyone that requests it. The unit and functional test suites will probably have to be broken down into more granular assignments for others to pick it up since you were assigned the whole framework.",

This is undocumented and will obviously close the circle of who can be tagged and so this PR reverts the addition of the file in #18949.~\r\n\r\n~This removes a line not being parsed in the CODEOWNERS file introduced in #18949. While the pattern [checked out](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18949#issuecomment-648859076) using `git ls-files`, it is preventing the CODEOWNERS file from automatically tagging reviewers. For future modifications to this file, note that [any line failing to parse causes the entire file to stop identifying codeowners](http://www.benjaminoakes.com/git/2018/08/10/Testing-changes-to-GitHub-CODEOWNERS/#:~:text=warning).~\r\n\r\n~I experimented in a [sandbox repo](https://github.com/adamjonas/bitcoin-codeowners-sandbox/pulls) to discover the offending line and this change appears to fix the problem.~\r\n\r\n",
