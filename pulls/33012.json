    "body": "For unconfirmed transactions, we currently distinguish between Script validation failures due to standardness rules and those due to consensus rules. The distinction is used to decide whether to disconnect the peer which submitted this transaction.\r\n\r\nThis is currently achieved by repeating Script validation with only the consensus verification flags, after it failed with the standardness flags. It is wasteful, and potentially significantly more so since we have Taproot. This PR proposes to replace this detection by having Script validation return the verification flag responsible for the failure instead.\r\n\r\nNote this is a slight behaviour change, as a consensus-related Script validation failure that happens after a standardness-related Script validation failure would not be treated as a consensus error anymore (and consequentially the peer not disconnected). I don't think this is an issue because we already do not treat all consensus-invalid transactions we get submitted as consensus errors. For instance, a non-standard transaction (for any reason other than its Scripts) with a consensus-invalid Script will be treated as a standardness error. Same for a transaction with a consensus-invalid Script in a later input than another with a non-standard Script. In these conditions, a Script that is consensus-invalid after being standardness-invalid is an edge case that seems unnecessary to detect. It also seems to me that the fact this edge case is detected at all is more an artifact of the existing logic (introduced in 97e7901a3a74 13 years ago) than a design decision. For all these reasons, this slight behaviour change seems fine to me (and definitely worth it when considering the upside of not having to run Script validation twice).\r\n\r\nThis change is quite verbose. If reviewers want i can try to make it less so, but i first wanted to open this as draft to get feedback on the broader approach of returning errors from Script validation directly instead of having to run it multiple times with different flags to distinguish the cause of an error.",

This commit adds additional cases to\ninvalid_txs.py to clarify the distinction and highlight the behaviour change in the next commit.\n\nWe treat a non-standard transaction with an invalid Script as non-standard (and not disconnect the\npeer), and always treat a standard transaction with an invalid Script (whether or not the Script\nitself is also non-standard) as consensus.

This prevents having to run Script validation a second time upon failure.\n\nIt does change behaviour slightly, in that a Script consensus failure after a Script standardness\nfailure won't be detected anymore, and therefore won't lead to a disconnect. This is arguably by\ndesign though: this can only ever be detected by running Script validation without the standardness\nverification flags, which we are trying to avoid here.",
