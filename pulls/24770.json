    "body": "This is a more minimal, no-frills version of #24734 for backport. The other fixes and improvements in that pull can be done after.\r\n\r\n*Copy of the PR 24734 description:*\r\n\r\nPRs #22736, #22904 and #23223 changed lock contention logging from a `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` compile-time preprocessor directive to a runtime `lock` log category and improved the logging output. This changed the locking from using `lock()` to `try_lock()`:\r\n\r\n- `void Mutex::UniqueLock::lock()` acquires the mutex and blocks until it gains access to it\r\n\r\n- `bool Mutex::UniqueLock::try_lock()` doesn't block but instead immediately returns whether it acquired the mutex; it may be used by `lock()` internally as part of the deadlock-avoidance algorithm\r\n\r\nIn theory the cost of `try_lock` might be essentially the [same](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-697) relative to `lock`. The test-and-set logic of these calls is purported to be ~ constant time, optimised and light/quick if used carefully (i.e. no mutex convoying), compared to system calls, memory/cache coherency and fences, wait queues, and (particularly) lock contentions. See the discussion around https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-902851054 and after with respect to performance/cost aspects.  However, there are reasonable concerns (see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#discussion_r691277896) and [here](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-620)) that `Base::try_lock()` may be potentially [costly](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-700) or [risky](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22904#issuecomment-930484001) compared to `Base::lock()` in this very frequently called code.\r\n\r\nOne alternative to keep the run-time lock logging would be to gate the `try_lock` call behind the logging conditional, for example as proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ccd73de1dd969097d34634c2be2fc32b03fbd09e and ACKed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-901980815). However, this would add the [cost](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-910102353) of `if (LogAcceptCategory(BCLog::LOCK))` to the hotspot, instead of replacing `lock` with `try_lock`, for the most frequent happy path (non-contention).\r\n\r\nIt turns out we can keep the advantages of the runtime lock contention logging (the ability to turn it on/off at runtime) while out of prudence putting the `try_lock()` call and `lock` logging category behind a  `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` compile-time preprocessor directive, and also still retain the lock logging enhancements of the mentioned PRs, as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24734#issuecomment-1085785480 by W. J. van der Laan, in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#discussion_r691280693, and in the linked IRC discussion.\r\n\r\nProposed here and for backport to v23.\r\n",

          "title": "Put lock contention logging behind `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` preprocessor directive",
          "body": "PRs #22736, #22904 and #23223 changed lock contention logging from a `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` compile-time preprocessor directive to a runtime `lock` log category and improved the logging output. This changed the locking from using `lock()` to `try_lock()`:\r\n\r\n- `void Mutex::UniqueLock::lock()` acquires the mutex and blocks until it gains access to it\r\n\r\n- `bool Mutex::UniqueLock::try_lock()` doesn't block but instead immediately returns whether it acquired the mutex; it may be used by `lock()` internally as part of the deadlock-avoidance algorithm\r\n\r\nIn theory the cost of `try_lock` might be essentially the [same](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-697) relative to `lock`. The test-and-set logic of these calls is purported to be ~ constant time, optimised and light/quick if used carefully (i.e. no mutex convoying), compared to system calls, memory/cache coherency and fences, wait queues, and (particularly) lock contentions. See the discussion around https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-902851054 and after with respect to performance/cost aspects.  However, there are reasonable concerns (see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#discussion_r691277896) and [here](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-620)) that `Base::try_lock()` may be potentially [costly](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-700) or [risky](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22904#issuecomment-930484001) compared to `Base::lock()` in this very frequently called code.\r\n\r\nOne alternative to keep the run-time lock logging would be to gate the `try_lock` call behind the logging conditional, for example as proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ccd73de1dd969097d34634c2be2fc32b03fbd09e and ACKed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-901980815). However, this would add the [cost](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-910102353) of `if (LogAcceptCategory(BCLog::LOCK))` to the hotspot, instead of replacing `lock` with `try_lock`, for the most frequent happy path (non-contention).\r\n\r\nIt turns out we can keep the advantages of the runtime lock contention logging (the ability to turn it on/off at runtime) while out of prudence putting the `try_lock()` call and `lock` logging category behind a  `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` compile-time preprocessor directive, and also still retain the lock logging enhancements of the mentioned PRs, as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24734#issuecomment-1085785480 by W. J. van der Laan, in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#discussion_r691280693, and in the linked IRC discussion.\r\n\r\nProposed here and for backport to v23.",

They'll all be removed when the parent PRs get merged.\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. Introducing cryptographic constructs(HKDF, ECDH, ChaCha20, Poly1305, FSChaCha20 and FSChaCha20Poly1305) in the test framework to help with P2P encryption.\r\n2. Performing v2 P2P encryption in a v2 connection.\r\n    * introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n    * this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    * the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n    * includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.",

It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

          "title": "log: Mitigate disk filling attacks by rate limiting LogPrintf",
          "body": "This picks up #19995 in an attempt to solve #21559.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to mitigate disk filling attacks by temporarily rate limiting `LogPrintf(…)`.\r\n\r\nA disk fill attack is an attack where an untrusted party (such as a peer) is able to cheaply make your node log to disk excessively. The excessive logging may fill your disk and thus make your node crash either cleanly (best case: if disk fill rate is relatively slow) or uncleanly (worst case: if disk fill rate is relatively fast).\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nThe hourly logging quota is set **per source location**. Every single source location (say net_processing.cpp:418) gets a quota of 1 MB of logging per hour. Logging is only dropped from source locations that exceed the quota.\r\n\r\n- Only logging to disk is rate limited. Logging to console is not rate limited.\r\n- Only `LogPrintf(…)` is rate limited. `LogPrint(category, …)` (`-debug`) is not rate limited.\r\n- `UpdateTip: new best=[…]` is logged using `LogPrintfWithoutRateLimiting(…)` to avoid rate limiting. High log volume is expected for that source location during IBD.\r\n- When logging is restarted a tally of how many messages/bytes were dropped is printed.\r\n- Log rate limiting can be disabled with the `-ratelimitlogging` config option.\r\n- All logs will be prefixed with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently being suppressed.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nIn a recent [PR Review Club meeting](https://bitcoincore.reviews/21603) we discussed this PR and evaluated alternative approaches.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Global rate limiting </summary>\r\n\r\n#### Global rate limiting\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion around an alternative approach which would be to globally rate limit `LogPrintf(…)`.  This approach was implemented in a competing PR #21706. The main point [1] in favor of global rate limiting is that it could be confusing to have incomplete logs when logs from one source location are dropped but not from others. The main point against global rate limiting is that it opens another attack vector where an attacker could trigger rate limiting and then execute a 2. attack which would then not be document in the logs at all. With regard to the attack vector on the global approach and the overall reviews the two approaches have gotten I have chosen to continue with the approach in this PR. \r\n(To address the concern of [1] i have chosen to prefix all logs with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently being suppressed.)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>logrotate</summary>\r\n\r\n#### logrotate\r\n\r\nLarryRuane brought up [logrotate](https://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate) which can be used on linux to monitor log files and perform actions (delete, compress, send somewhere, etc.) on them when a certain size or point in time is reached. `logrotate` could be used to rate limit log but since we would like log rate limiting to be enabled by default it is not the best solution. Also on windows an alternative would have to be used.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI have a written a unit test which is contained in this PR. (Not the greatest test, it currently does not work on windows thanks to `\\r\\n`. If someone has an idea how to improve the test i would appreciate it)\r\n\r\nFurther more I made a RPC [here](https://github.com/dergoegge/bitcoin/commit/8e6d15d6be06834d1f634f4a54ea646be8bc3491) that can log excessive amounts of \"a\"s from different locations which i have found useful during my own testing.\r\n`bitcoin-cli excessivelog <location (1-5)> <num_bytes>`\r\n\r\n⚠️One thing to note with that rpc is that the rate limiting logic still prints the last message that triggered the limiting to disk, so something like `bitcoin-cli excessivelog 1 536870912` would still log ~512MiB to disk. Logging to console is also never suppressed (unless -printtoconsole=0)  ⚠️\r\n\r\nA simple example to use the rpc:\r\n```bash\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest setmocktime 1\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 1048500 # log just under 1MiB\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 100 # this should get the total amount logged above 1MiB\r\n                                        # and the rate limiting logic should kick in\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest setmocktime 3602 # let 1 hour pass (only works in regtest)\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 100 # this should trigger logging to resume\r\n```\r\n",
