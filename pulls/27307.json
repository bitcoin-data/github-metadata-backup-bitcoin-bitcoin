    "body": "The `mempool_conflicts` variable is added to `CWalletTx`, it is a set of txids of txs in the mempool conflicting with the wallet tx or a wallet tx's parent. This PR only changes how mempool-conflicted txs are dealt with in memory.\r\n\r\n`IsSpent` now returns false for an output being spent by a mempool conflicted transaction where it previously returned true.\r\n\r\nA txid is added to `mempool_conflicts` during  `transactionAddedToMempool`. A txid is removed from `mempool_conflicts` during  `transactionRemovedFromMempool`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a `mempoolconflicts` field to the `gettransaction` wallet RPC result.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #27145\r\nSecond attempt at #18600",

          "title": "wallet: Keep track of the wallet's own transaction outputs in memory",
          "body": "Currently, the wallet is not actually aware about its own transaction outputs. Instead, it will iterate all of the transactions stored in `mapWallet`, and then all of the outputs of those transactions, in order to figure out what belongs to it for the purposes of coin selection and balance calculation. For balance calculation, there is caching that results in it only iterating all of the transactions, but not all of the outputs. However when the cache is dirty, everything is iterated. This is especially problematic for wallets that have a lot of transactions, or transactions that have a lot of unrelated outputs (as may occur with coinjoins or batched payments).\r\n\r\nThis PR helps to resolve this issue by making the wallet track all of the outputs that belong to it in a new member `m_txos`. Note that this includes outputs that may have already been spent. Both balance calculation (`GetBalance`) and coin selection (`AvailableCoins`) are updated to iterate `m_txos`. This is generally faster since it ignores all of the unrelated outputs, and it is not slower as in the worst case of wallets containing only single output transactions, it's exactly the same number of outputs iterated.\r\n\r\n`m_txos` is memory only, and it is populated during wallet loading. When each transaction is loaded, all of its outputs are checked to see if it is `IsMine`, and if so, an entry added to `m_txos`. When new transactions are received, the same procedure is done.\r\n\r\nSince imports can change the `IsMine` status of a transaction (although they can only be \"promoted\" from watchonly to spendable), all of the import RPCs will be a bit slower as they re-iterate all transactions and all outputs to update `m_txos`.\r\n\r\nEach output in `m_txos` is stored in a new `WalletTXO` class. This class contains references to the parent `CWalletTx` and the `CTxOut` itself. It also caches the `IsMine` value of the txout. This should be safe as `IsMine` should not change unless there are imports. This allows us to have additional performance improvements in places that use these `WalletTXO`s as they can use the cached `IsMine` rather than repeatedly calling `IsMine` which can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe existing `WalletBalance` benchmark demonstrates the performance improvement that this PR makes. The existing `WalletAvailableCoins` benchmark doesn't as all of the outputs used in that benchmark belong to the test wallet. I've updated that benchmark to have a bunch of unrelated outputs in each transaction so that the difference is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger project to have the wallet actually track and store a set of its UTXOs.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #24914 as it requires loading the txs last in order for `m_txos` to be built correctly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks:\r\n\r\nMaster:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       92,245,141.50 |               10.84 |    0.1% |  988,823,975.00 |  66,803,340.50 |    0.0% |      2.04 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            5,709.90 |          175,134.50 |    0.5% |       80,968.24 |      25,539.15 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|          139,396.17 |            7,173.80 |    0.6% |    1,383,390.50 |     430,276.86 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            5,055.80 |          197,792.47 |    0.3% |       80,968.10 |      25,539.02 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|                9.79 |      102,152,396.19 |    0.1% |          161.00 |          37.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,552,736.00 |              644.02 |    1.5% |   20,316,315.80 |     618,545.80 |    0.6% |      0.08 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|      114,114,732.00 |                8.76 |    0.5% |1,291,047,717.60 | 320,244,602.00 |    0.0% |      6.30 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      359,315,754.00 |                2.78 |    0.1% |4,339,447,818.00 | 136,619,757.00 |    0.7% |      1.80 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|       98,230,601.00 |               10.18 |    0.1% |  537,688,964.00 |  97,332,266.00 |    0.3% |      0.49 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       75,319,868.50 |               13.28 |    0.2% |  863,758,229.00 |  30,892,593.00 |    0.2% |      1.66 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            2,367.62 |          422,364.95 |    1.0% |       35,785.05 |       9,893.01 |    0.2% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|            2,685.58 |          372,359.55 |    0.2% |       36,501.05 |      10,027.01 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            3,462.24 |          288,830.68 |    2.7% |       35,785.06 |       9,893.01 |    0.3% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|               11.65 |       85,838,176.97 |    0.1% |          180.00 |          42.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,563,092.60 |              639.76 |    1.5% |   20,426,154.40 |     649,953.80 |    0.6% |      0.09 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|       58,367,804.40 |               17.13 |    0.9% |  587,164,005.00 | 107,905,843.80 |    0.1% |      3.21 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      365,302,636.00 |                2.74 |    0.2% |4,349,345,147.00 | 138,730,668.00 |    0.8% |      1.83 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|      124,995,585.00 |                8.00 |    1.2% |  801,998,316.00 | 103,210,721.00 |    0.3% |      0.63 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n",

          "body": "UI notifications and the -walletnotify process should be triggered for wallet transactions that are conflicted out of the mempool by a newly connected block.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it has been broken by 7e89994 by removing the call to `SyncTransaction()` for block-conflicted transactions in `CWallet::BlockConnected`. This PR restores conflict tracking but instead relies on `TransactionRemovedFromMempool`. \r\n\r\nDoing so allows for wider conflict detection, i.e non-connected wallet transactions. Transaction A may not involves wallet but may be spent by a transaction B paying back to a wallet address. Double-spend of transaction A won't trigger a conflict for transaction B as A isn't tracked by wallet (`mapTxSpends`).\r\n\r\nThis PR also extends conflicts detection to mempool replacement (`MemPoolRemovalReason::REPLACED`), as for an end-user, consequences are likely to be interpreted the same, conflicted funds aren't available. Distinction of reasons (block-connected or mempool-replacement) should stay clear for us.\r\n\r\nConflicts detection stays a best-effort, as a mempool replacement may happen while wallet is shutdown, and mempool isn't replayed at wallet rescan, conflict can't be see.\r\n\r\nFixes #18325 ",

          "body": "## For reviewers\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since it's much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122\r\n  - Implements the logic from BIP352 without any wallet code. This PR adds the necessary cryptographic functions and implements the logic needed for sending and scanning. This PR also includes the test vectors from the BIP as unit tests. Both the send and receive PRs have this as a dependency. In terms of priority, this PR should be reviewed first\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201\r\n  - Implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to send to a silent payment address, regardless of whether or not the wallet can receive silent payments\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202\r\n  - Implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet. This PR allows a wallet to generate silent payment addresses and scan for silent payments, regardless of whether or not the wallet can send to a silent payment address\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Overall\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the full silent payments scheme: sending and receiving. The following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` are covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* External signer support (dependent on hardware wallets supporting silent payments)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897. Below is a summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove labels\r\n  * The original draft included labels, but this has been deferred for a later PR. Labels are not necessary for sending and receiving and there are still some open questions on how best to implement them in Bitcoin Core. Labels can also be added at any point by the receiver without requiring any changes from the sender\r\n* Remove indexes\r\n  * In the original draft, indexes were used when scanning for silent payments and when doing wallet rescans. This has been removed in favor of using `rev*.dat` files for rescanning. It may make sense to add an index in the future, but for the purpose of vending tweak data to light clients, which is still an open question\r\n* Update to implement the most current version of BIP352\r\n  * Since the original draft, there have been a few changes in the BIP which are reflected in the current PR. Most notably, using 33-byte compressed keys for the silent payment address (as opposed to X-only keys in the original draft) \r\n\r\nIt may be helpful for context to read through the discussions on #24897 , but ongoing review should happen in the relevant child PRs listed above.",

This TXO set is iterated for balance checking and coin selection preparation, which can still be slow for wallets that have had a lot of activity. This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

          "body": "This PR implements receiving silent payment transactions through the use of a new `ScriptPubKeyMan` type: `SilentPaymentsSPKM`. This is a descriptor wallet only feature, although it does not use descriptors.\r\n\r\nThis is an optional feature, so the only way to use it is to create a new wallet with `createwallet` with `silent_payments=true`. Such wallets will have a single `SilentPaymentsSPKM` that is used for both receiving and change. Since silent payments only have a single address, repeated calls to `getnewaddress` and `getrawchangeaddress` always return the same address, however the receiving and change addresses are different, see the BIP for how the change is generated.\r\n\r\nSince silent payments requires the spent coins in order to extract public keys from them, `TransactionAddedToMempool` is modified to also provide that information. For scanning blocks, the wallet will retrieve that information from the undo data. Additionally, when rescanning, a silent payments wallet must use the slow rescan method.\r\n\r\nThe labels feature has not been fully implemented yet and is left for a followup.\r\n\r\nBased on #28122 and #28201 \r\n\r\nAlternative to #28202",

          "body": "Originally, this PR fixed a wallet migration bug that could cause the watchonly wallet created by legacy wallet migration to have incorrect transaction height values. A different fix for the bug was implemented in #28609, but that PR did not add any test coverage that would have caught the bug, and didn't include other changes from this PR intended to prevent problems from invalid transaction heights.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new asserts to catch invalid transaction heights, which would trigger test failures without bugfix in #28609. This PR also refactors code and adds comments to clarify assumptions and make it less likely a bug from invalid transaction height values would be introduced.",

Is it still possible to abandon a transaction with conflicts with the mempool? If a transaction is already abandoned and we know it conflicts with the mempool does `isMempoolConflicted` still return false?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like a more straightforward way to implement this feature would be to add a `bool mempool_conflicts` field to `TxStateInactive` rather than adding a new `TxStateMempoolConflicted` state. The description of `TxStateInactive` says \"May conflict with the mempool, or with an unknown block, or be abandoned, never broadcast, or rejected from the mempool for another reason.\" So the inactive state was meant to handle transactions that could have conflicts or be inactive for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nI think I would recommend removing the new `MempoolConflicted` state here, but otherwise keeping this PR unchanged. The mempool tracking feature, renames, and other cleanups here do seem very nice, so it is good to see this work.",

[...]\r\n\r\nI will also add that I think adding a new top-level state instead of just adding a new field to TxStateInactive makes this PR considerably harder to review because you have to manually search for every line of code that is accessing the `m_state` field directly or indirectly and verify that it is either:\r\n\r\n1. Treating the TxStateInactive and TxStateMempoolConflicted states equivalently and not changing behavior\r\n2. Treating the TxStateInactive and TxStateMempoolConflicted states differently and changing behavior in a useful way.\r\n\r\nIf can avoid adding a new top-level state it would make this PR easier to review, because you could focus on the second case, and easily see where behavior is changing and not changing, which I don't think is possible with the current approach.\r\n\r\nThis is not a fundamental objection, but might be something to consider.",

Abandoned is not a permanent state - as soon as it shows back up in the mempool, it'll no longer be abandoned. As soon as a conflict appears in a block, it'll no longer be abandoned. Likewise, if a transaction shows up in the mempool that conflicts with it, it should reflect that it is now conflicted and no longer needs to be marked as abandoned. Abandoned has always been a transient state since someone else could rebroadcast the transaction to the network. Once there's something else that makes the transaction invalid, I don't think it's useful to keep track of whether it is abandoned, so we wouldn't need to have more states to track that.",

But I don't see why the abandoned state be should be cleared just because a mempool heuristic happened to detect a conflict. That just seems like a bad UX and a confusion of two orthogonal concepts. The abandoned state is transient in the sense that it can be overriden by mempool events and block confirmations, but it should be less transient than the mempool conflicted state because it (1) reflects user intent and (2) is actually serialized to disk, so it doesn't seem to me something that should be thrown away unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nAlso, the PR description doesn't mention anything about discarding the abandoned state so this seems to me like an unintentional bug than a sensible design choice.\r\n\r\nI would just recommend adding the conflict tracking feature without adding a new top level state and without changing the behavior of abandoned transactions (especially unintentionally). It would shrink this PR, make it safer and easier to review, and provide all the benefits of the current implementation.

      "body": "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27307#issuecomment-1926350798\r\n\r\nThanks ishaanam for pointing out the lines of code that answer my questions. Since original links got broken in rebase, here are stable links that point to the two lines of code which prioritize the abandoned state over the conflicted state:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3de89342dcd44bdde4027a91cb27793dc0231847#diff-1f2db0e4d5c12d109c7f0962333c245b49b696cb39ff432da048e9d6c08944d8L1313-R1313\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3de89342dcd44bdde4027a91cb27793dc0231847#diff-1f2db0e4d5c12d109c7f0962333c245b49b696cb39ff432da048e9d6c08944d8R1443-R1444\r\n\r\nThis is better than what I was afraid of, since the abandoned state consistently takes priority over the mempoolconflicted state. But this behavior is fragile and unnecessarily complicates our internal model and potential RPC and GUI interfaces, because there's no logical reason for the abandoned and mempool conflicted states to contradict each other, when both can be true at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf we take the current approach in 3471ebc8c6ee268ad501525121ea3f3a221fb5ad, we will have to be careful going forward, whenever we do any state change, to remember that the abandoned state is supposed to take priority over the mempool conflicted state (this is not even documented anywhere), and decide how we want to deal with potentially odd states like `mempool_conflicts` set being nonempty when the transaction is not in the `MempoolConflicted` state.\r\n\r\nFor background, I already think it's bad that abandoned and block-conflicted states exclude each other, and that the block conflicted state takes priority over the abandoned state and resets it. But the block conflicted state is pretty permanent, so it's basically just a UI quirk if a block conflict causes the abandoned state to be forgotten about. There are also backwards compatibility benefits to storing the block conflict and abandoned bit exclusively in the same field.\r\n\r\nIn the current case, though, there are no backwards compatibility concerns, so it seems wrong and unnecessary to go out our way to create an unenforced, undocumented, and confusing hierarchy of states: _MempoolConflicted < Abandoned < BlockConflicted_, when there is a simpler alternative of just straightforwardly representing the information we have about transactions directly.\r\n\r\nIt seems pretty clear to me that it would make this change simpler, safer and easier to review, make the code more straightforward and maintainable long term, and avoid potential bugs and confusion in the UI if it just represented abandoned and mempool conflicted states independently and didn't try to establish a hierarchy between them.\r\n\r\nI think a good approach would avoid adding a `TxStateMempoolConflicted` top-level state, and just add a `bool mempool_conflicts` or `std::set<Txid> mempool_conflicts` member to the `TxStateInactive` struct. And it is good to rename `TxStateConflicted` to `TxStateBlockConflicted` too for clarity. If you're skeptical of this approach, I'd be curious to know why, but we can also experiment in a separate PR if you are concerned there are benefits in this PR which would be lost.\r\n\r\nIf it would be helpful, I could make another PR next week to compare the two approaches. But I'd be curious to know what you think. There is a lot of a complexity and a long history of bugs in wallet transaction state tracking (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Wallet-Transaction-Conflict-Tracking) so I think think it is worth taking a little more time to get this right.",

Seems like a very nice change that improves the wallet balance calculation and ability to spend, and also returns useful information about the mempool.\r\n\r\nThanks for the updates, too. I think comparing current a650caab9f11be7f5927f9aa556bb7d2a8ebed33 to previous a6ae5b23b1497ab6f4899db49348db623700a2d8, the resulting code is simpler and the charges are more direct and easier to review.\r\n\r\nI left some more suggestions below, but most are not important and none are critical so feel free to ignore them.",

          "body": "This is an attempt to demonstrate what is necessary to get `-Wshadow` building under `-Werror` on clang, and to see what other existing pull requests that might conflict with.\r\n\r\nThis was prompted by [an example of shadowing I spotted in review](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29473#discussion_r1501678205). We currently [warn against shadowing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#shadowing) in the docs but do not detect it, so instead rely on review to identify these issues.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n* This was [previously enabled in 2016 ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8794) and [reverted six months later](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10136).\r\n* [I proposed a version in 2019](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15377) using a different approach in a different context.\r\n\r\nThe question is: have the circumstances changed in the past 9 years? Is a partial fix beneficial?\r\n\r\nOne option would be to merge the low-risk changes, re.  tests, etc. and exclude\r\nsensitive files from this warning to get it applied to regular builds.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27087\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

This PR makes the wallet UI safer by not rendering transactions as fully confirmed until the background validation is done.\r\n\r\nInstead it shows the same icon as when a transaction has 1 confirmation. This is quite conservative. The cost of tricking someone into accepting a fake coin, by giving them a invalid snapshot`*` and then mining a block on top of it, is higher than a regular doublespend by mining.\r\n\r\n![pending](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/10217/a2a95190-a1a7-402e-822b-b0829d5bdf45)\r\n\r\n`* =` in the current implementation this involves giving someone a malicious binary or getting them to recompile\r\n\r\nCaveat: because transaction state is updated after `blockConnected`, if you restart the node during background sync, then the transaction will show as fully confirmed (`\"assumed\": false`) briefly - until the next block is connected.",

The solution implemented here, augments the mempool transaction `REPLACED` signal with the double-spending transaction which the wallet stores and watches for in Block notifications. A map is added to the wallet to track conflicting tx ids and their child transactions.  The entry is erased when the double-spending tx is removed from MemPool.\r\n",

Additionally, I felt that it was more uniform with the other transaction states to be describing the state of the transaction instead of the state of a conflict. Eg. `TxStateBlockConflicted` indicates that the transaction is block-conflicted, and similarly `TxStateConfirmed` indicates that the transaction is confirmed. On the other hand, `TxStateConfirmedConflict` indicates the state of the conflict. \r\n\r\nThat being said, if you or others think that `TxStateConfirmedConflict` or something similar is better, I would be open to changing it.

Most things in the wallet are keyed and listed by txid, so with this change, we'd end up with a transaction that's listed as conflicted by it's own txid. Also, we won't ever update the wallet to store a transaction with a different wtxid.\r\n\r\nSorry I didn't see this earlier. After looking at this again I don't think that same-txid-different-witness will be a problem here. Please see: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27307#discussion_r1484797295",

Also, if isConflicted were renamed to isBlockConflicted in the first commit, and then introduced as a new function here, these changes would be a lot more obvious because the relevant code would have visible diffs here.",

So it would be very reassuring to add the test coverage before making the changes and see the changes having the expected effects on tests, instead of making the changes blindly and adding the test coverage later.",
