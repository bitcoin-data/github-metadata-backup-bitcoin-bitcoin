    "body": "I have updated signapple to notarize MacOS app bundles without adding any additional dependencies. Further, it can also sign and apply detached signatures to standalone binaries.\r\n\r\nAs such, we can use signapple to perform the notarization and stapling steps so that MacOS will run the app bundle after it is installed. `detached-sig-create.sh` is updated to have a notarization step and to download the ticket which will be included in the detached signatures. The workflow is largely unchanged for the MacOS codesigners except for the additional requirement of having an App Store Connect API key and Team UUID, instructions for which can be found at https://github.com/achow101/signapple/blob/master/docs/notarization.md. For guix builders, the workflow is unchanged.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the standalone binaries packaged in the MacOS `.tar.gz` and Windows `.zip` will now be codesigned. `detached-sig-create.sh` was updated to handle these, so the workflow for both MacOS and Windows codesigners remains unchanged. For guix builders, the workflow is also unchanged.\r\n\r\nBecause those binaries will how have codesigned and unsigned versions, the build command is modified to output `-unsigned.{tar.gz,zip}` archives containing the binaries. Since this happens to conflict with the tarball used for codesigning, the codesigning tarball was renamed to `-codesigning.tar.gz`. Both MacOS and Windows codesigners will need to adjust their workflows to account for the new name.\r\n\r\nFixes #15774 and #29749",
