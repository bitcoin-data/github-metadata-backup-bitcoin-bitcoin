    "body": "I have updated signapple to notarize MacOS app bundles without adding any additional dependencies. Further, it can also sign and apply detached signatures to standalone binaries.\r\n\r\nAs such, we can use signapple to perform the notarization and stapling steps so that MacOS will run the app bundle after it is installed. `detached-sig-create.sh` is updated to have a notarization step and to download the ticket which will be included in the detached signatures. The workflow is largely unchanged for the MacOS codesigners except for the additional requirement of having an App Store Connect API key and Team UUID, instructions for which can be found at https://github.com/achow101/signapple/blob/master/docs/notarization.md. For guix builders, the workflow is unchanged.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the standalone binaries packaged in the MacOS `.tar.gz` and Windows `.zip` will now be codesigned. `detached-sig-create.sh` was updated to handle these, so the workflow for both MacOS and Windows codesigners remains unchanged. For guix builders, the workflow is also unchanged.\r\n\r\nBecause those binaries will how have codesigned and unsigned versions, the build command is modified to output `-unsigned.{tar.gz,zip}` archives containing the binaries. Since this happens to conflict with the tarball used for codesigning, the codesigning tarball was renamed to `-codesigning.tar.gz`. Both MacOS and Windows codesigners will need to adjust their workflows to account for the new name.\r\n\r\nFixes #15774 and #29749",

There it works fine on both Firefox and Safari:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/304b06bf-20cd-470f-a4e1-22e9cddf2af0\r\n\r\nI also just noticed now that i don't have access to the Mac anymore that in Liana it used to be an x86 binary in the zip, so it might make a difference. Although i think the Wizardsardine team is now also shipping arm binaries.",

This [forum thread](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/721117) suggests it can be done by temporarily zipping them and sending them Apple in that form.\r\n\r\nThe binaries can be notarized, but the notarization cannot be stapled, which is why I elected to not notarize them. This means that anyone who runs those binaries will be phoning home to apple, but I guess that will happen regardless of notarization. I believe notarizing the individual binaries will require additional changes to signapple.\r\n\r\n> I tried downloading it through Safari and likewise other reviewers i encountered an error:\r\n\r\nThat seems like a different error. Also, I believe others were testing the binaries tarball, not the zipped app bundle.",

We do not use data from these checks to learn what individual users are using on their devices.\r\n\r\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-qa/102445\r\n\r\nIf we tell users to do `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine bin/*`, it would both ensure the binaries work _and_ has a chance of avoiding the \"hi Apple I use Bitcoin\" call. But I haven't checked this. \r\n\r\nBut where would that instruction go? Adding a README would pollute the `/usr/local` directory for anyone using a script to download and extract. Saying it on the download page is probably the best option, even if not everyone looks there.",

Then double-click to extract the Tar in Finder. And then start `bitcoind` from the terminal.\r\n\r\nThe only confusing bit is that you can't start `bitcoind` from finder, which isn't super useful anyway. Except for `bitcoin-qt` where this is annoying, however most GUI users will presumably download the zip archive.\r\n\r\nUsing `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine bitcoin-e181bda061ca/bin/bitcoin-qt` frees up the binary so that you can run it from Finder as well. So it seems the binaries still get some level of quarantine, but at least they work from the terminal which is the most important.",

      "body": "@achow101 for 096525e92cc2f5a4318bae13cedd2cf36b928d5f did you only notarize the arm binaries and not x86? As a sanity check I tried that archive again, to see what happens I start binaries from the terminal. `bitcoind` works and the others refuse. Once I right-click open the other binaries, they start working. Since I right-click opened that version of `bitcoind` yesterday, that makes sense, and implies the notarization indeed helps.\r\n\r\nOne more thing worth trying might be to notarize the `tar.gz` archive. However it seems Finder launches things in a different way than the Terminal, and it might Just Not Work (tm): https://stackoverflow.com/a/75161940\r\n\r\nAn earlier Apple Forum thread also suggests that the way to notarize these binaries is to put the contents of the `tar.gz` archive into a zip and then upload: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/651759",

      "body": "> > An earlier Apple Forum thread also suggests that the way to notarize these binaries is to put the contents of the tar.gz archive into a zip and then upload\r\n> \r\n> That's what we're doing.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm misreading the `find` incantation here:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n# Notarize the binaries\r\n# Binaries cannot have stapled notarizations so this does not actually generate any output\r\nbinaries_dir=$(dirname \"$(find . -maxdepth 2 -wholename '*/bin' -type d -exec realpath --relative-to=. {} \\;)\")\r\n${SIGNAPPLE} notarize --passphrase \"${api_key_pass}\" \"$2\" \"$3\" \"${binaries_dir}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it seems that this only picks the binaries. But if I understand the Apple priests correctly, you have to send the whole package.\r\n\r\nHowever I agree that if this works it would contradict this:\r\n\r\n> According to https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/706379, starting a command line tool from Finder just doesn't work in general.\r\n\r\nUnless they recently fixed bug 58097824 (or do so in the future; it's only been open [for 5 years](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/654480)). But the step may be unnecessary in any case. Apple's description of the issue suggest it's really about individual binaries, not the archive.\r\n\r\n> Tool Blocked by Gatekeeper\r\n> If your product includes a command-line tool, you might notice this behaviour:\r\n> When you double click the tool in Finder, it’s blocked by Gatekeeper.\r\n> When you run the tool from within Terminal, it works.\r\n\r\n> This is a known bug in macOS (r. 58097824). The issue is that, when you double click a tool in the Finder, it doesn’t run Gatekeeper’s standard execution logic. Rather, the Finder passes the tool to Terminal as a document and that opens a window (and associated shell) in which to run that document. This triggers Gatekeeper’s document logic, and that logic always blocks the tool.\r\n\r\n> There are two ways around this:\r\n\r\n> Embed your tool in an application. If the user runs the application first, Gatekeeper runs its normal application check. If the user allows the app to run, Gatekeeper records that decision and applies it to the app and any code within the app, including your tool.\r\n\r\nThis might explain what @darosior experienced when bundling `bitcoind` inside Liana: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31407#issuecomment-2663476018\r\n\r\nAnd it's potentially good news for a multiprocess future where the GUI might be launching a node process.\r\n\r\n> Install your tool using an installer package. When the user goes to install the package, Gatekeeper checks it. Assuming that check passes, Gatekeeper does no further checks on the content it installed.\r\n\r\nI don't think we want to go this route.",

If there is a regression there, it's caused by something else.\r\n\r\n> Can you elaborate on why this is this expected?\r\n\r\nOpening an app as @davidgumberg did is always going to result in that error. MacOS has significant restrictions on apps, which is why we need to do this whole sign and notarize song and dance.\r\n\r\n > If the unsigned binaries will no-longer work at all (regardless of any workarounds), then I assume we are going to stop uploading them entirely?\r\n\r\nWe still include them in the SHA256SUMS which was the stated reason for uploading all guix build artifacts, including things that are irrelevant to end users like the codesigning tarballs. So presumably we will continue to upload them to /bin, although not link to them from the downloads page.",
