    "body": "Improve error reporting in `autogen.sh` by redirecting the autoreconf dependency check's error message to stderr.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `autogen.sh` in the root directory.\r\n\r\n- No change to the functional behavior of these files.\r\n- Enhances error reporting by directing error messages to stderr, aligning with best practices.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n1. **9 years ago:** Added the check for the `autoreconf` dependency to the `autogen.sh` build script. This check avoids a `not found` error because the next line runs autoreconf.\r\n\r\n   - Original error message: `./autogen.sh: 9: ./autogen.sh: autoreconf: not found`\r\n   - Updated error message: `configuration failed, please install autoconf first`\r\n   - [Link to commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/889426d37e331c9e6c914dae824663a7167effdf) to the commit.\r\n\r\n2. **5 years ago:** Updated the check from `which` to `command -v` to improve portability and reliability as part of a large lint refactor.\r\n\r\n   - [Link to commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/1ac454a3844b9b8389de0f660fa9455c0efa7140#diff-7544c8642acdd15d295934770061473e64323316cd9797fb78c1830ebba08cf2L14) to that commit.\r\n",
