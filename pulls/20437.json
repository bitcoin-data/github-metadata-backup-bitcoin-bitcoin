Don't forget to contribute any coverage increasing inputs you find to the [Bitcoin Core fuzzing corpus repo](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets).\r\n\r\nHappy fuzzing :)",

Hence the constant rather than a fuzzer provided value.\r\n\r\nI agree that if we are okay with invalidating seeds then `SetMockTime(ConsumeTime(fuzzed_data_provider));` is obviously the superior choice. (FWIW I'm not opposed to invalidating seeds for these harnesses.)\r\n\r\nI think we still need a constant for the `-mocktime` parameter passed to `BasicTestingSetup` though (for `InitializeFuzzingContext`). Did you have any number in mind that is better than `1`? :)\r\n\r\nI'll fix `SetMockTime(ConsumeTime(fuzzed_data_provider));` and `-mocktime=N` when we've chosen the most appropriate default :)",

Locally the targets are non-deterministic before and after this change.\r\n\r\nOne way to test that time-based non-determinism is removed is probably to introduce `if (g_fuzzing_started) { assert(false); }` in the relevant part of `GetTime`, and set `g_fuzzing_started = true;` in `test_one_input`. Then compare the results before and after this patch :)",
