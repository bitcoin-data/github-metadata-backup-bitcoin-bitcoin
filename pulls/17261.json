    "body": "Continuation of wallet boxes project.\r\n\r\nActually makes ScriptPubKeyMan an interface which LegacyScriptPubkeyMan. Moves around functions and things from CWallet into LegacyScriptPubKeyMan so that they are actually separate things without circular dependencies.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIntroducing the `ScriptPubKeyMan` (short for ScriptPubKeyManager) for managing scriptPubKeys and their associated scripts and keys. This functionality is moved over from `CWallet`. Instead, `CWallet` will have a pointer to a `ScriptPubKeyMan` for every possible address type, internal and external. It will fetch the correct `ScriptPubKeyMan` as necessary. When fetching new addresses, it chooses the `ScriptPubKeyMan` based on address type and whether it is change. For signing, it takes the script and asks each `ScriptPubKeyMan` for whether that `ScriptPubKeyMan` considers that script `IsMine`, whether it has that script, or whether it is able to produce a signature for it. If so, the `ScriptPubKeyMan` will provide a `SigningProvider` to the caller which will use that in order to sign.\r\n\r\nThere is currently one `ScriptPubKeyMan` - the `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`. Each `CWallet` will have only one `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` with the pointers for all of the address types and change pointing to this `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`. It is created when the wallet is loaded and all keys and metadata are loaded into it instead of `CWallet`. The `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` is primarily made up of all of the key and script management that used to be in `CWallet`. For convenience, `CWallet` has a `GetLegacyScriptPubKeyMan` which will return the `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` or a `nullptr` if it does not have one (not yet implemented, but callers will check for the `nullptr`). For purposes of signing, `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`'s `GetSigningProvider` will return itself rather than a separate `SigningProvider`. This will be different for future `ScriptPubKeyMan`s.\r\n\r\nThe `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` will also handle the importing and exporting of keys and scripts instead of `CWallet`. As such, a number of RPCs have been limited to work only if a `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` can be retrieved from the wallet. These RPCs are `sethdseed`, `addmultisigaddress`, `importaddress`, `importprivkey`, `importpubkey`, `importmulti`, `dumpprivkey`, and `dumpwallet`. Other RPCs which relied on the wallet for scripts and keys have been modified in order to take the `SigningProvider` retrieved from the `ScriptPubKeyMan` for a given script.\r\n\r\nOverall, these changes should not effect how everything actually works and the user should experience no difference between having this change and not having it. As such, no functional tests were changed, and the only unit tests changed were those that were directly accessing `CWallet` functions that have been removed.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the last step in the [Wallet Structure Changes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Wallet-Class-Structure-Changes).",

It would seem safer to trigger some kind of error for non-legacy wallets if planned behavior hasn't been implemented yet, than to just do nothing.\r\n\r\nIf there is supposed to be legacy / non-legacy distinction, it would seem better to move legacy code out of CWallet into LegacyScriptPubKeyMan in a `PostEncrypt` or similar ScriptPubKeyMan virtual method\r\n\r\n",
