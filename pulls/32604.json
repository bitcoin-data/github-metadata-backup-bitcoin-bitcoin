    "body": "This revives the work done by dergoegge in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21603. The approach is similar — this PR uses `std::source_location` under the hood now that we can use c++20 features. It also resets the rate limiting statistics via the `CScheduler`. The logging functions have also changed slightly since that PR was opened, so work has been done to preserve the intent of the original rate limiting change. I have tried to give commit attribution where possible.\r\n\r\n**Approach:**\r\nEach source code location is given an hourly logging quota of 1MiB of logging per hour. Logging is only dropped from source locations that exceed the quota.\r\n- Only logging to disk is rate limited. Logging to console is not rate limited.\r\n- Printing with the category argument is not rate limited.\r\n- `UpdateTip: new best=[…]` is logged without rate limiting. High log volume is expected for that source location during IBD.\r\n- When logging is restarted a tally of how many bytes were dropped is printed.\r\n- All logs will be prefixed with [*] if there is at least one source location that is currently being suppressed.\r\n\r\nI've repurposed the old logging rpc mentioned in #21603 in another branch for testing [here](https://github.com/Crypt-iQ/bitcoin/tree/log_ratelimiting_05192025_rpc). This can be used to log from source locations and test out the new changes in logging behavior. Note that the `setmocktime` RPC needs to be used to set the mock time past the current clock time to reset the logging messages.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 1048500 # log just under 1MiB\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 100 # this should get the total amount logged above 1MiB\r\n                                        # and the rate limiting logic should kick in\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 2 1048500\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 2 100 # trigger rate limiting from another location\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest mockscheduler 3600 # fast-forward the scheduler\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 100 # this should trigger logging to resume and will log the source locations that were reset\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n```\r\n2025-07-02T22:03:56Z [warning] Excessive logging detected from rpc/node.cpp:142 (RPCHelpMan excessivelog()): >1048576 bytes logged during the last time window of 3600s. Suppressing logging to disk from this source location until time window resets. Console logging unaffected. Last log entry.\r\n[*] 2025-07-02T22:03:56Z aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n2025-07-02T22:04:58Z (mocktime: 2262-04-11T23:47:15Z) Restarting logging from rpc/node.cpp:142 (RPCHelpMan excessivelog()): 121 bytes were dropped during the last 3600s.\r\n2025-07-02T22:04:58Z (mocktime: 2262-04-11T23:47:15Z) Restarting logging from rpc/node.cpp:139 (RPCHelpMan excessivelog()): 121 bytes were dropped during the last 3600s.\r\n```",

      "body": "The latest change uses a single `BCLog::LogRateLimiter` instance and uses a slimmer way of tracking the amount of logging bytes left per `std::source_location`. I like the approach better as `m_categories` is no longer being used. I would like to point out that the rate-limiting logic can be bypassed if `LogPrintLevel` is used. I think `LogPrintLevel` callers need to be cautious and I kind of think this macro shouldn't be used if `level >= BCLog::Level::Info`.\r\n\r\n> Will that appear on the console as well, which didn't have any messages dropped?\r\n\r\nYes this appears in the console as well. I actually was unsure if console-logging should be rate-limited or not. Hopefully users have sensible limits on their terminal history?\r\n\r\nI will work on fixing the CI, I think review can still happen in the meantime while I debug the windows failure and fix the tidy job.",

This feels like a much more natural fit to me, and allows a couple of other improvements. See branch [here](https://github.com/stickies-v/bitcoin/commits/2025-06/schedule-ratelimit-reset/), or diff [here](https://github.com/Crypt-iQ/bitcoin/compare/2ac8696b53e455dd27c8341828404a23b5cb68a9..9fb36ba46bccad079b4aea6062f7d187b7ef7775).\r\n\r\nEither way, I'll do a full re-review soon. I think the PR achieves its (important) stated goals, and while I think my suggested improvement is worthwhile, it isn't necessary or blocking. Making progress is more important than getting it perfectly right here.",

I hope you can untangle the different directions, I know that so many comments can be overwhelming, I hope you take it the way that I meant them.\r\n\r\nMy main concerns are that the code doesn't seem finished yet, it still contains commented out code, typos, redundant comments, dangerous recursion, prefixes for non-dropped log lines, duplicate state management - and I'm not even entirely sure we should be restricting logs per line in the first place.\r\nAlso, having so many remaining inconsistencies and mixed styles and undocumented decisions makes it harder to find code smells that would help us catch mistakes (e.g. like the ones I mentioned above).",

      "body": "> My main concerns are that the code doesn't seem finished yet, it still contains commented out code, typos, redundant comments, dangerous recursion, prefixes for non-dropped log lines, duplicate state management - and I'm not even entirely sure we should be restricting logs per line in the first place.\r\n\r\nI've responded to most of your concerns in-line. I think you've left some excellent suggestions for a follow-up, but I've not seen anything that imo warrants not merging this PR in this current shape. I understand that you'd like to see improvements, and I'd be happy to review the follow-up (as well as re-review here if the author decides to address anything), but without blockers I think it's absolutely fair for the author to decide that these can be done in a follow-up. I'd prefer not having a third version of this PR.",

I went over the code multiple times, left nits and comments and questions all over, regardless of the severity.\r\n\r\nI have responded to some of the comments that were about behavior changes. I hope this isn't taken as lip-service to get the PR merged, but I will make a follow-up PR post-merge to address the style and test comments (I have a list of the comments that need to be addressed). I think the most pressing comments are about behavior changes and I have attempted to address those. I think this behavior change is overdue for the codebase and it has went through iterations across several previous PRs of striking a balance between getting this mitigation shipped into production and some other less-pressing issues.\r\n\r\n> I know that so many comments can be overwhelming, I hope you take it the way that I meant them.\r\n\r\nI don't take it personally, review is a scarce resource and more review is better than less review. As a newcomer, I'm realizing the (appropriate) high bar for review in this project. At this point, though, I think this PR is finished as far as behavior goes and I think it is reasonable to leave the non-behavior changes to a follow-up PR.",

We switch to using it instead\nof the __func__ identifier and the __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros.\n\nBufferedLog is changed to have a std::source_location member, replacing the\nsource_file, source_line, and logging_function members. As a result,\nMemUsage no longer explicitly counts source_file or logging_function as the\nstd::source_location memory usage is included in the MallocUsage call.\n\nThis also changes the behavior of -logsourcelocations as std::source_location\nincludes the entire function signature. Because of this, the functional test\nfeature_config_args.py must be changed to no longer include the function\nsignature as the function signature can differ across platforms.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Niklas Gogge <n.goeggi@gmail.com>\nCo-Authored-By: stickies-v <stickies-v@protonmail.com>\n",

      "message": "log: use std::source_location in place of __func__, __FILE__, __LINE__\n\nThe std::source_location conveniently stores the file name, line number,\nand function name of a source code location. We switch to using it instead\nof the __func__ identifier and the __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros.\n\nBufferedLog is changed to have a std::source_location member, replacing the\nsource_file, source_line, and logging_function members. As a result,\nMemUsage no longer explicitly counts source_file or logging_function as the\nstd::source_location memory usage is included in the MallocUsage call.\n\nThis also changes the behavior of -logsourcelocations as std::source_location\nincludes the entire function signature. Because of this, the functional test\nfeature_config_args.py must be changed to no longer include the function\nsignature as the function signature can differ across platforms.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Niklas Gogge <n.goeggi@gmail.com>\nCo-Authored-By: stickies-v <stickies-v@protonmail.com>",

There are currently only two places where these log unconditionally, when [flushing to anchors.dat](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2d59977601ea18f189991fa027364e69293c61a9/src/addrdb.cpp#L230) and when [writing UTXO snapshots](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2d59977601ea18f189991fa027364e69293c61a9/src/rpc/blockchain.cpp#L3182-L3184) so this is not a problem today AFAICT, but it is a bit of a footgun for future users of `LOG_TIME*`, one approach to solving it could look like: https://github.com/davidgumberg/bitcoin/commit/5fb07e80a422cf7b65da94dda2e1c0619c80eab3\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary> \r\n\r\n#### Benchmark results\r\n\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ ./build/bin/bench_bitcoin -filter=\"Log.*\" -min-time=10000\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Branch (4c772cbd83e502a1339e8993d192ea6416ecd45c)\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |          cyc/op |    IPC |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|----------------:|-------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|              901.02 |        1,109,855.48 |    0.7% |       14,673.87 |        3,198.96 |  4.587 |       3,030.13 |    0.1% |     10.83 | `LogWithDebug`\r\n|              903.56 |        1,106,735.32 |    0.4% |       15,262.89 |        3,206.54 |  4.760 |       3,119.37 |    0.1% |     10.81 | `LogWithThreadNames`\r\n|                2.61 |      383,423,939.51 |    0.1% |           70.00 |           11.18 |  6.263 |          16.00 |    0.0% |     10.99 | `LogWithoutDebug`\r\n|              817.98 |        1,222,522.02 |    0.6% |       13,723.71 |        2,866.27 |  4.788 |       2,793.33 |    0.1% |     10.77 | `LogWithoutThreadNames`\r\n|               28.37 |       35,246,387.38 |    0.7% |          440.00 |          121.69 |  3.616 |         107.00 |    0.0% |     11.04 | `LogWithoutWriteToFile`\r\n\r\n#### Pre-merge master (b7e9dc8e46)\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |          cyc/op |    IPC |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|----------------:|-------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|              883.86 |        1,131,404.74 |    1.1% |       14,673.94 |        3,136.38 |  4.679 |       3,030.14 |    0.1% |     10.83 | `LogWithDebug`\r\n|              897.16 |        1,114,625.39 |    0.7% |       15,262.84 |        3,189.17 |  4.786 |       3,119.36 |    0.1% |     10.84 | `LogWithThreadNames`\r\n|                2.60 |      384,716,694.70 |    0.3% |           70.00 |           11.15 |  6.279 |          16.00 |    0.0% |     11.01 | `LogWithoutDebug`\r\n|              816.35 |        1,224,958.62 |    0.2% |       13,723.80 |        2,852.35 |  4.811 |       2,793.35 |    0.1% |     10.72 | `LogWithoutThreadNames`\r\n|               28.28 |       35,357,376.60 |    0.4% |          440.00 |          121.30 |  3.627 |         107.00 |    0.0% |     11.01 | `LogWithoutWriteToFile`\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

I can see how it reduces the diff, but I'm not sure that's worth it. I'll think about an alternative approach - have you considered any already?\r\n\r\nSince the user doesn't have to be able to configure any of this, and we only have a single `UNCONDITIONAL_ALWAYS` use case (and likely won't have (many) more in the future), I think adding an `is_conditional=True` arg to `LogPrintLevel` and a `LogInfoAlways` macro might be an alternative?",

I also understand if you disagree with this and I would appreciate an explanation, I want to understand.\r\n\r\nWe can still get invalid data (thanks for triggering a clarification), but maybe the guard should added per `LogFlags` and we may want to blacklist instead of whitelisting.\r\nOr is this meant as a final catch-all for all the unknowns, e.g. maybe there's a trick to enable LevelDB logs externally and this should still guard against that?",

I think that option 2) to modify all call-sites to pass in a rate-limiting argument is cumbersome when most callers don't need to be aware of rate limiting and it should instead be done under-the-hood (i.e. `UpdateTipLog` is the exception to the rule). I think using a boolean for rate-limiting vs no-rate-limiting is better than a uint64_t because then the proposed `SourceLocationCounter` needs to also keep track of this window-scaling value (i.e. multiple of `WINDOW_MAX_BYTES`).\r\n\r\nI might be wrong here, curious to hear thoughts.",

The reason I had the original change is because `FormatLogStrInPlace` inserts a timestamp at the beginning of `str` and I wanted the prepended rate-limiting logs to occur after the timestamp. With the new change, the rate-limiting logs are first in `str` followed by the time-stamp. I think now the logs look a little wonky, but I like the code change better. I could also extract the time-stamp prepend logic so it's called after `NeedsRateLimiting`.",

I don't think this is a robust way of deciding on rate limiting.\r\n\r\nI think I would prefer either:\r\n1. using `LogPrintLevel_` directly in `UpdateTipLog()`, with a comment on why we're using a private function and not enabling rate limiting here. A `LogInfoAlways` macro could be an alternative.\r\n2. refactoring `logging.h` replace a lot of the current macros to become regular functions using `std::source_location`, allowing easier overloads for ratelimiting. This probably makes more sense in a separate pull, so imo going with 1. in this PR and then improving with 2. separately would be nice?",

On my machine, `__func__` contains just the function name, whereas `function_name()` returns the entire signature, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n__func__: AppInitParameterInteraction\r\nsource_location: bool AppInitParameterInteraction(const ArgsManager &)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't see how this affects any maps, though? I think it just affects the messages when we stop and restart logging?\r\n\r\n> I think m_cs is unnecessary if m_ratelimiter is guarded by m_cs?\r\n\r\nYeah nice, that seems correct. Probably good to add \"This class is not thread-safe.\" to the `LogRateLimiter` docstring, given that it is likely to be used in a multithreaded context. ",

It's unfortunate that these message are counted in `is_ratelimited = !m_source_locations[source_loc].Consume(str.size());`, but suppressions should be extremely rare, so triggering enough of them to cause a meaningful difference here seems impractical. A solution with not too much change could be to change to `MaybeResetWindow(const std::string& str, std::string& resume_msg)`, so we can keep separate accounting, but yeah not sure that's worth it/important.",

      "body": "I was long overdue for my biannual confusion about (dynamic) memory usage, but luckily here it is. It seems like I got it entirely backwards in my previous comment. The memory pointed to by `std::source_location` is static, so I don't think we need to account for any of it beyond what the `memusage::MallocUsage(sizeof(memusage::list_node<BCLog::Logger::BufferedLog>))` statement is already doing.\r\n\r\nOrthogonal, but since we're touching the line anyway: dynamic memory usage of `std::string` should be measured with `.capacity()` instead of `.size()`.  Or even better, use the [`DynamicUsage(const std::string&)`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/154b98a7aaae248f5d40ca567d1ec51410d09bae/src/memusage.h#L94) function we already have to also account for small string optimization, which, of course, is totally a thing.\r\n\r\nSo the function could become:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstatic size_t MemUsage(const BCLog::Logger::BufferedLog& buflog)\r\n{\r\n    return memusage::DynamicUsage(buflog.str) +\r\n           memusage::DynamicUsage(buflog.threadname) +\r\n           memusage::MallocUsage(sizeof(memusage::list_node<BCLog::Logger::BufferedLog>));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll in all, this should mean that thanks to ca0c1a7a9ce9198c950e123d36c9e4bb13db13da we can now buffer quite a bit more messages within our 1MB limit. Obviously not going to change anything meaningful, but wouldn't hurt to add a line to commit msg to highlight that.",

      "body": "Sorry for the wait, branch is ready: https://github.com/stickies-v/bitcoin/commits/2025-06/schedule-ratelimit-reset/ . I added the \"fixup\" comments as commits that should be squashable into the current branch as-is (requiring rebase for the commits above, though). Hopefully the isolation of the changes makes this easier to review and potentially adopt into this PR.\r\n\r\nThe main change is that I've carved out scheduling from `LogRateLimiter` (leaving that to `CScheduler`), which allows quite a bit of subsequent improvements. Specifically for this thread, I've [refactored](https://github.com/stickies-v/bitcoin/commit/c466e7b8ef11d0feb762c2b2ed41db695cd21602) `NeedsRateLimiting` into `Consume` that does not have any side-effects (except update internal accounting, as expected by the Consume name).\r\n\r\nThe other changes (see [diff](https://github.com/Crypt-iQ/bitcoin/compare/2ac8696b53e455dd27c8341828404a23b5cb68a9..9fb36ba46bccad079b4aea6062f7d187b7ef7775)) I've implemented in this branch include:\r\n- change `Logger::m_limiter` to a pointer so it can more easily be (re)set, allowing for easier testing.\r\n- add unit tests specifically for the `LogRateLimiter` interface that I find quite a bit easier to understand than the existing `rate_limit` tests, but there may be merit in keeping both (I've updated the latter so they don't break, but they should probably be deduplicated at least somewhat)\r\n- made `LogRateLimiter` thread-safe since it is now used in multiple threads\r\n- various cleanups, including removing the unnecessary `m_suppressed_locations` (now a `m_suppression_active` boolean), parameterizing the max_bytes and reset_window, ...\r\n- removes the need for the test-only `BCLog::Logger::ResetLimiter()` function\r\n\r\nI think the PR is in a good enough shape as it is, and I don't want to block progress. I like the new interface of my suggestion quite a bit better than the old one, and I think it is worth the time and effort to overhaul this (I spent a lot of time carving everything out in separate commits to make rebasing easy), but I understand this PR has had a lot of back-and-forth already. I'll leave it up to the author if he wants to change the approach here, of if I'll do it in a follow-up (which unfortunately would be a lot of churn). In either case, I'll shortly do a full re-review. \r\n",

(#32604)\r\n\r\nWhen `-logsourcelocation` is enabled, the log output now contains the entire function signature\r\ninstead of just the function name. (#32604)\r\n```",

[suggestion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32604#discussion_r2172385738), I removed the mutex guard for `m_limiter` because the class is now thread-safe, but of course that doesn't prevent race conditions on the setting of `m_limiter`, e.g. when one thread calls [`SetRateLimiting()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32604/files#diff-21abb6b14af1e9330a6f0c89a87231035a439248c556ef5e110eb0617b88a1f4R275) and another inspects [if `m_limiter` is set](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32604/files#diff-44fd50b51e8fc6799d38f193237fb921ec9d34306c448f64837524a17bac06eeR455), which is what TSan caught here.\r\n\r\nCan be fixed by re-introducing the `m_cs` guard:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>git diff on 34fc54d547</summary>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/logging.h b/src/logging.h\r\nindex f81f4947af..c801e94e28

That kinda' seems worse to me, maybe we should investigate a simpler solution first.\r\n\r\nBut if we stay with the per-line logging-quota, I think this should at least be explained in the PR description.",

Is it to avoid iterating the values of the map to find a `0`?\r\nBut shouldn't we only prefix the *dropped* lines by `*` anyway (why prefix the lines that aren't dropped in the first place?), so why do we care about a global suppression state, i.e.\r\n```C++\r\n// To avoid confusion caused by dropped log messages when debugging an issue,\r\n// we prefix log lines with \"[*]\" when there are any suppressed source locations.\r\nif (m_limiter->SuppressionsActive()) {\r\n    str_prefixed.insert(0, \"[*] \");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is more confusing than only prefixing the dropped lines, i.e. something like:\r\n```C++\r\nif (m_print_to_console && ratelimit) {\r\n    str_prefixed.insert(0, \"[*] \");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich would eliminate the need for `m_suppression_active` as far as I can tell.",

I have personally had to use logs to piece together what happened after-the-fact when somebody's machine was compromised. The concern brought up in the earlier PRs was about an attacker finding two vulnerabilities if there is a global limit:\r\n- a logging vulnerability that triggers the global rate limit\r\n- a separate vulnerability which goes undetected because all logs to disk are now suppressed\r\n\r\n> Maybe, but this could apply currently as well, you just have to make sure you exhaust the target logger before the second attack.\r\n\r\nI don't think this applies currently -- because the rate limiting is done per source-code location, an attacker will leave a trail of evidence.\r\n\r\n> And as far as I can tell currently any hack which would enable all logs to be written would allow log-locations * 1MiB additional lines to be added.\r\n\r\nI can't find a bug in the current version of the code that allows this to happen. If there is some way to bypass the rate limiting logic, that would be severe. However, the same issue would also exist in the global rate limiting case.\r\n\r\n> But if we stay with the per-line logging-quota, I think this should at least be explained in the PR description.\r\n\r\nThis is explained in the PR description under the \"Approach\" section -- it mentions source code locations.",
