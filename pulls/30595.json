    "body": "This is a first attempt at introducing a C header for the libbitcoinkernel library that may be used by external applications for interfacing with Bitcoin Core's validation logic. It currently is limited to operations on blocks. This is a conscious choice, since it already offers a lot of powerful functionality, but sits just on the cusp of still being reviewable scope-wise while giving some pointers on how the rest of the API could look like.\r\n\r\nThe current design was informed by the development of some tools using the C header:\r\n\r\n* A re-implementation (part of this pull request) of [bitcoin-chainstate](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/bitcoin-chainstate.cpp).\r\n* A re-implementation of the python [block linearize](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/linearize) scripts: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/kernelLinearize \r\n* A silent payment scanner: https://github.com/josibake/silent-payments-scanner\r\n* An electrs index builder: https://github.com/josibake/electrs/commits/electrs-kernel-integration\r\n* A rust bitcoin node: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/kernel-node\r\n* A reindexer: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/kernelApi_Reindexer\r\n\r\nNext to the C++ header also made available in this pull request, rust bindings are available here:  https://github.com/TheCharlatan/rust-bitcoinkernel. The rust bindings include unit and fuzz tests for the API.\r\n\r\nThe header currently exposes logic for enabling the following functionality:\r\n* Feature-parity with the now deprecated libbitcoin-consensus\r\n* Optimized sha256 implementations that were not available to previous users of libbitcoin-consensus thanks to a static kernel context\r\n* Full support for logging as well as control over categories and severity\r\n* Feature parity with the existing experimental bitcoin-chainstate\r\n* Traversing the block index as well and using block index entries for reading block and undo data.\r\n* Running the chainstate in memory\r\n* Reindexing (both full and chainstate-only)\r\n* Interrupting long-running functions\r\n\r\nThe pull request introduces a new kernel-only test binary that purely relies on the kernel C header and the C++ standard library. This is intentionally done to show its capabilities without relying on other code inside the project. This may be relaxed to include some of the existing utilities, or even be merged into the existing test suite.\r\n\r\nThe complete docs for the API as well as some usage examples are hosted on [thecharlatan.ch/kernel-docs](https://thecharlatan.ch/kernel-docs/index.html). The docs are generated from the following repository (which also holds the examples): [github.com/TheCharlatan/kernel-docs](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/kernel-docs).\r\n\r\n#### How can I review this PR?\r\n\r\nScrutinize the commit messages, run the tests, write your own little applications using the library, let your favorite code sanitizer loose on it, hook it up to your fuzzing infrastructure, profile the difference between the existing bitcoin-chainstate and the bitcoin-chainstate introduced here, be nitty on the documentation, police the C interface, opine on your own API design philosophy.\r\n\r\nTo get a feeling for the API, read through the tests, or one of the examples.\r\n\r\nPlease try to avoid nits for the tests, these can wait for later and easily be improved over time. Docs exhaustively explaining all the intricacies of the internal goings-on of the library can also be added later.\r\n\r\nTo configure this PR for making the shared library and the bitcoin-chainstate and test_kernel utilities available:\r\n```\r\ncmake -B build -DBUILD_KERNEL_LIB=ON -DBUILD_UTIL_CHAINSTATE=ON\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce compiled the library is part of the build artifacts that can be installed with:\r\n```\r\ncmake --install build\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython headers might also be useful for testing. [ctypeslib2](https://pypi.org/project/ctypeslib2/)'s [clang2py](https://github.com/trolldbois/ctypeslib/blob/master/ctypeslib/clang2py.py) can be used to auto-generate bindings:\r\n```\r\nclang2py src/kernel/bitcoinkernel.h -l /path/to/bitcoin/src/.libs/libbitcoinkernel.so > test_wrapper.py\r\n```\r\nOr alternatively on macOS (after `cmake --install build`):\r\n```\r\nclang2py /usr/local/include/bitcoinkernel.h -l /usr/local/lib/libbitcoinkernel.dylib --nm $(PWD)/nm_patch.py > test_wrapper.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Why a C header (and not a C++ header)\r\n\r\n* Shipping a shared library with a C++ header is hard, because of name mangling.\r\n* Mature and well-supported tooling for integrating C exists for nearly every popular language.\r\n* C offers a reasonably stable ABI\r\n\r\nAlso see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30595#issuecomment-2285719575.\r\n\r\n#### What about versioning?\r\n\r\nThe header and library are still experimental and I would expect this to remain so for some time, so best not to worry about versioning yet.\r\n\r\n#### Potential future additions\r\n\r\nIn future, the C header could be expanded to support (some of these have been roughly implemented):\r\n\r\n* Handling transactions, block headers, coins cache, utxo set, meta data, and the mempool\r\n* Adapters for an abstract coins store\r\n* Adapters for an abstract block store\r\n* Allocators and buffers for more efficient memory usage\r\n* An \"[io-less](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/how-to-sans-io.html)\" interface\r\n\r\n#### Current drawbacks\r\n\r\n* For external applications to read the block index of an existing Bitcoin Core node, Bitcoin Core needs to shut down first, since leveldb does not support reading across multiple processes. Other than migrating away from leveldb, there does not seem to be a solution for this problem.\r\n* The fatal error handling through the notifications is awkward.\r\n* Handling shared pointers in the interfaces is unfortunate. They make ownership and freeing of the resources fuzzy and poison the interfaces with additional types and complexity. However, they seem to be an artifact of the current code that interfaces with the validation engine. The validation engine itself does not seem to make extensive use of these shared pointers.\r\n* If multiple instances of the same type of objects are used, there is no mechanism for distinguishing the log messages produced by each of them.\r\n* The background leveldb compaction thread may not finish in time leading to a non-clean exit. There seems to be nothing we can do about this, outside of patching leveldb.",

      "body": "Thank you for the questions and kicking this discussion off @ryanofsky! I'll update the PR description with a better motiviation re. C vs C++ header, but will also try to answer your questions here.\r\n\r\n> This seems to offer a lot of nice features, but can you explain the tradeoffs of wrapping the C++ interface in C instead of using C++ from rust directly? It seems like having a C middle layer introduces a lot of boilerplate, and I'm wondering if it is really necessary. For example it seems like there is a rust cxx crate (https://docs.rs/cxx/latest/cxx/, https://chatgpt.com/share/dd4dde59-66d6-4486-88a6-2f42144be056) that lets you call C++ directly from Rust and avoid the need for C boilerplate. It looks like https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html is an even more full-featured way of calling c++ from python.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the interoperability between C++ and Rust has become very good. In fact there is someone working on wrapping the entirety of Bitcoin Core in Rust: https://github.com/klebs6/bitcoin-rs.\r\n\r\nDuring the last Core Dev meeting in Berlin I also asked if a C API were desirable in the first place ([notes here](https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2024-04/kernel/)) during the libbitcoinkernel session. I moved forward with this implementation, because the consensus at the time with many contributors in the room was that it was desirable. The reasons for this as discussed during the session at the meeting can be briefly summarised:\r\n\r\n* Shipping a shared library with a C++ header is hard\r\n* Mature and well-supported tooling for integrating C exists for nearly every popular language.\r\n* C offers a reasonably stable ABI\r\n\r\nSo if we want the broadest possible support, across as many languages as possible with both dynamic and statically compiled libraries, a C header is the go-to option. I'm speculating here, but a C++ header might also make future standard version bumps and adoption of new standard library features harder. If having some trade-offs with compatibility, library portability, and language support is acceptable, a C++ header might be acceptaple though. It would be nice to hear more reviewers give their opinions here. \r\n\r\nI'd also like to add that two libraries that we use and depend on in this project, [minisketch](https://github.com/sipa/minisketch/tree/master) and [zeromq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/), use the same pattern. They are C++ codebases, that only expose a C API that in both instances can be used with a C++ RAII wrapper. So there is precedent in the free software ecosystem for doing things this way.\r\n\r\nThe quality of C++ language interop seems to vary a lot between languages. Python and Rust seem to have decent support, ziglang on the other hand has no support for C++ bindings. JVM family languages are a bit hit and miss, and many of the common academic and industrial data analysis languages, like Julia, R, and Matlab have no support for direct C++ bindings. The latter category should not be disregarded as potential future users, since this library might be useful to access Bitcoin Core data for data analysis projects.\r\n\r\n> Another drawback of going through a C API seems like not just increased boilerplate, but reduced safety. For example, the implementation is using reinterpret_cast everywhere\r\n\r\nI feel like the reduced type safety due to casting is bit of a red herring. The type casting can be harder to abuse if you always use a dedicated helper function for interpreting passed in data types (as I believe is implemented here). Casting is also a pattern used in many other projects; both minisketch and libzmq use similar type casts extensively. It should definitely be possible to scrutinize the API in this PR to a point where it offers decent safety to its users as well as contributors to and maintainers of this code base.\r\n\r\nThe concerns around boilerplate are more serious in my view, but at least with the current internal code and headers I feel like exposing a _safe_ C++ API is not trivial either. The current headers do not lend themselves to it well, for example through tricky locking mechanics, exposing boost types, or confusing lifetimes. There also comes a point where we should probably stop extensively refactoring internal code for the kernel. I've heard some voices during the last two Core Dev meetings with concerns that the kernel project might turn the validation code into an extensive forever building site. Having some boilerplate and glue to abstract some the ugliness and make it safe seems like an acceptable solution for this dilemma. If this means boilerplate is required anyway, I would personally prefer a C API.\r\n\r\nSome of the boilerplate-y duplicate definitions in the header could be dropped again eventually if some of the `enum`s are moved to C-style `enum`s instead of `class enum`. As long as they are properly namespaced, I don't see a big drawback for this. Similarly, some of the structs could be defined in a way where they can be used on both sides using pimpl or similar idioms. All in all, most of these translations seem very straightforward.\r\n\r\nIt might be interesting to see how some of the RPC methods could be re-implemented using the kernel header. There have been some RPC implementation bugs over the years that were due to unsafe usage of our internal code within the method implementations. Using the kernel header instead might make this safer and reduce boilerplate. To  be clear, I am not suggesting replacing the implementations, but separately re-implementing some of them to show where the kernel header might shine.\r\n\r\n> it seems like the exposed C functions use a kernel_ErrorCode enum type with the union of every possible error type, so callers don't have a way to know which functions can return which errors.\r\n\r\nWe have disagreed on the design of this before. If I understood you correctly, consolidating all error codes into a single enumeration was one of the reasons you opened your version for handling fatal errors in the kernel: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29700 as an alternative to my original: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29642. I am still a bit torn by the two approaches. I get that it may be useful to exactly see which errors may be encountered by invoking a certain routine, but at the same time I get the feeling this often ends up splintering the error handling to the point where you end up with a catch all approach after all. I also think that it is nice to have a single, central list for looking up all error codes and defining some routines for handling them in close proximity to their definition. It would be nice to finally hear some more voices besides the two of us discussing this. real-or-random has recently provided some good points on error handling in the libsecp [silent payments pr](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1519#issuecomment-2142599641) (that I mostly did not adopt in this PR) and argues that most error codes are not useful to the user. As mentioned in the description, error handling is a weak spot of this pull request and I would like to improve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Like is this 20%, 30%, or 50% of the expected size?\r\n\r\nI like the idea of reviewing and merging this PR, and establishing a way to interoperate with rust libraries and external projects. I just think going forward we should not lock ourselves into an approach that requires everything to go through a C interface. As we build on this and add features, we should experiment with other approaches that use C++ directly, especially when it can reduce boilerplate and avoid bugs.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing to me to the other error handling discussion. I very much agree with the post that says having a single error handling path is highly desirable. I especially agree with this in cases where detailed error messages are still provided (keeping in mind that error handling != error reporting, you can return simple error states with detailed messages or logging). Of course there are places where callers do need to handle separate error cases, especially when there are temporary failures, timeouts, and interruptions, and in these cases functions should return 2 or 3 error states instead of 1. But I don't think there is a reason in modern application code for functions to be able to return 5, 10, 20, or 50 error states generally. In low-level or very general OS, networking or DBMS code it might make sense, but for application code it seems like a cargo cult programming practice that made IBM service manuals very impressive in the 1980s but does not have a present day rationale. There are special cases, but I don't think it should be a normal thing for functions to be returning 15 error codes if we are trying to provide a safe and easy to use API.\r\n\r\nAgain though, if this approach is the easiest way to get cross-language interoperability working right now, I think we should try it. I just think we should be looking for ways to make things simpler and safer going forward.",

Like is this 20%, 30%, or 50% of the expected size?\r\n\r\nI think a fair comparison would be comparing the amount of code \"glue\" required, e.g. the size of the `bitcoinkernel.cpp` file in this pull request. The size of the header is very dependent on the detail of documentation and I think judging it by the amount of test code is also hard. On my branch including iterators for the UTXO set, handling headers, and simple mempool processing, basically all the stuff required to drop-in replace the calls to validation code in `net_processing` with the C API, is about similar in size: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30595/files#diff-cc28221ef8d0c7294dda4e3df9f70bb6c062006b387468380c2c2cc02b6762c3 . The code on that branch is more hacky than the code here, so I would expect a bit less than a doubling in size to get all the features  required to run a full node with transaction relay.\r\n\r\n> In low-level or very general OS, networking or DBMS code it might make sense, but for application code it seems like a cargo cult programming practice that made IBM service manuals very impressive in the 1980s but does not have a present day rationale.\r\n\r\nHeh, well put. I think for most functions here it could be feasible to have more concise error codes without too much effort, but I feel like I have to detach from this a bit before being able to come up with an alternative.",

When functions need to return more complicated information or can fail in different ways that callers will want to distinguish, it should be easy to return the relevant information in custom struct or enum types. I think it's usually better for functions to return simpler custom types than more complicated shared types, because it lets callers know what values functions can return just by looking at their declarations.",

      "body": "> I think for most functions here it could be feasible to have more concise error codes without too much effort, but I feel like I have to detach from this a bit before being able to come up with an alternative.\r\n\r\nCompletely got rid of the `kernel_Error` with the last push. Thanks for laying out your logic ryanofsky, I feel like this is cleaner now. When looking at the Rust wrapper, the code seems much clearer too. Errors are now communicated through nullptr or false values. Where required, so far only for the verification functions, a richer status code is communicated to the developer.",

      "body": "Thanks for the update. It's good to drop the error codes so the C API can correspond 1:1 with the C++ API and not be tied to a more old fashioned and cumbersome error handling paradigm (for callers that want to know which errors are possible and not have to code defensively or fall back to failing generically).\r\n\r\nI am still -0 on the approach of introducing a C API to begin with, but happy to help review this and get merged and maintain it if other developers think this is the right approach to take (short term or long term). **It would be great to have more concept and approach ACKs for this PR** particularly from the @theuni who commented earlier and @josibake who seems to have some projects built on this and linked in the PR description.\r\n\r\nI think personally, if I wanted to use bitcoin core code from python or rust I would use tools like:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/pybind/pybind11\r\n- https://docs.rs/cxx/latest/cxx/\r\n- https://hkalbasi.github.io/zngur/\r\n\r\nAnd interoperate with C++ directly,  instead of wrapping the C++ interface in a C interface first. Tools like these do not support all C++ types and features, and can make it necessary to selectively wrap more complicated C++ interfaces with simpler C++ interfaces, or even C interfaces, but I don't think this would be a justification for preemptively requiring every C++ type and function to be wrapped in C before it can be exposed. I just think the resulting boilerplate code:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nkernel_Warning cast_kernel_warning(kernel::Warning warning)\r\n{\r\n    switch (warning) {\r\n    case kernel::Warning::UNKNOWN_NEW_RULES_ACTIVATED:\r\n        return kernel_Warning::kernel_LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN;\r\n    case kernel::Warning::LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN:\r\n        return kernel_Warning::kernel_LARGE_WORK_INVALID_CHAIN;\r\n    } // no default case, so the compiler can warn about missing cases\r\n    assert(false);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand duplicative type definitions and documentation:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n/**\r\n * A struct for holding the kernel notification callbacks. The user data pointer\r\n * may be used to point to user-defined structures to make processing the\r\n * notifications easier.\r\n */\r\ntypedef struct {\r\n    void* user_data;                         //!< Holds a user-defined opaque structure that is passed to the notification callbacks.\r\n    kernel_NotifyBlockTip block_tip;         //!< The chain's tip was updated to the provided block index.\r\n    kernel_NotifyHeaderTip header_tip;       //!< A new best block header was added.\r\n    kernel_NotifyProgress progress;          //!< Reports on current block synchronization progress.\r\n    kernel_NotifyWarningSet warning_set;     //!< A warning issued by the kernel library during validation.\r\n    kernel_NotifyWarningUnset warning_unset; //!< A previous condition leading to the issuance of a warning is no longer given.\r\n    kernel_NotifyFlushError flush_error;     //!< An error encountered when flushing data to disk.\r\n    kernel_NotifyFatalError fatal_error;     //!< A un-recoverable system error encountered by the library.\r\n} kernel_NotificationInterfaceCallbacks;\r\n```\r\n\r\nare fundamentally unnecessary and not worth effort of writing and maintaining when C++ is not a new or unusual language and not meaningfully less accessible or interoperable than C is.\r\n\r\nThere are legitimate reasons to wrap C++ in C. One reason would be to provide ABI compatibility. Another would be to make code accessible with dlopen/dlsym. But I think even in these cases you would want to wrap C++ in C selectively, or just define an intermediate C interface to pass pointers but use C++ on either side of the interface. I don't think you would want to drop down to C when not otherwise needed.\r\n\r\nThis is just to explain my point of view though. Overall I think this is very nice work, and I want to help with it, not hold it up.\r\n",

The new code here does not necessarily need to be part of the main bitcoin core git repository, and it could be in a separate project. A benefit of this approach is it could relieve bitcoin core developers from the responsibility of updating the C API and API documention when they change the C++ code. But a drawback is that C API might not always be up to date with latest version of bitcoin core code and could be broken between releases. Also it might not be as well reviewed or understood and might have more bugs.",

I have been focusing on using the kernel library in proof of concept applications to get a better sense of how well the library works for downstream users and to hopefully uncover any pain points preemptively. A few of these projects are linked in the PR description.\r\n\r\nRegarding a C header vs C++ header, thanks @ryanofsky for taking the time to explain your thought process. I think you raise some excellent points. I'll try to respond as best I can, despite being slightly out of my depth on this topic 😅 \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor me, the value of libbitcoinkernel is only fully realised with the broadest possible language support and ease of use for downstream projects. This is why I strongly prefer the C header approach for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Mature tooling for C language bindings\r\n2. Stable ABI\r\n3. Well established pattern in other open source projects\r\n\r\nIf we agree that broad language support is a goal of libbitcoinkernel, highlighting languages that _do not_ support C++ bindings is a much more compelling argument for a C header than highlighting languages that _do_ support C++ bindings as an argument for a C++ header.\r\n\r\nRegarding some of the mentioned languages/tools which do have C++ language binding support: \r\n\r\n> Tools like these do not support all C++ types and features, and can make it necessary to selectively wrap more complicated C++ interfaces with simpler C++ interfaces, or even C interfaces\r\n\r\nIn this example, who is doing the wrapping to be able to use these tools? If it's us, this seems much more complicated to ship and maintain a mixed wrapper and also feels over engineered to a specific set of tools and languages. It also does nothing for languages that do not support C++ bindings at all. As @TheCharlatan mentioned, languages favoured by academia lack C++ binding support and making libbitcoinkernel useful for academic research is a particularly important use case of libbitcoinkernel for me. \r\n\r\nIf we are exposing just a C++ header and expecting the downstream user to wrap selective parts in C interfaces to use libbitcoinkernel, we've eroded a fundamental value proposition of libbitcoinkernel, in my opinion. Namely, we want to provide a safe to use consensus library for users and minimise the risk of downstream projects introducing consensus bugs. Requiring downstream projects to write their own C++/C interfaces to be able to use kernel means that a) they just won't use libbitcoinkernel or b) will introduce bugs when writing these wrappers. Said differently, if boilerplate will be needed for broad language support, I would prefer we focus our energy on writing and reviewing boilerplate code that ensures the usefulness of the library for the broadest possible user base, instead of requiring a subset of users to each write their own boilerplate without any review from us.",

      "body": "Reworked after receiving a bunch of out-of-band feedback. In short:\r\n\r\n* Got rid of the `void *` option handling. Options are now set through dedicated functions instead of a single setter for all options.\r\n* Got rid of the `kernel_TaskRunner`. The context now holds an immediate task runner internally on which a user can register various validation interfaces. It is now the user's responsibility to process the validation callbacks in a non-blocking fashion with their own infrastructure.\r\n* Got rid of raw data types in validation functions. Instead the raw data is now parsed and processed beforehand and the user always passes opaque data types.\r\n* Got rid of the explicit transaction output struct. The user can now retrieve the data with helper functions applied on opaque transaction output objects.",

For\nnow the external validation interface only has support for the\n`BlockChecked` callback, but support for the other internal validation\ninterface methods can be added in the future.\n\nThe validation interface follows an architecture for defining its\ncallbacks and ownership that is similar to the notifications.\n\nThe task runner is created internally with a context, which itself\ninternally creates a unique ValidationSignals object. When the user\ncreates a new chainstate manager the validation signals are internally\npassed to the chainstate manager through the context.\n\nThe callbacks block any further validation execution when they are\ncalled. It is up to the user to either multiplex them, or use them\notherwise in a multithreaded mechanism to make processing the validation\nevents non-blocking.\n\nA validation interface can register for validation events with a\ncontext.

The undo data of a block contains all the spent\nscript pubkeys of all the transactions in a block.\n\nIn normal operations undo data is used during re-orgs. This data might\nalso be useful for building external indexes, or to scan for silent\npayment transactions.\n\nInternally the block undo data contains a vector of transaction undo\ndata which contains a vector of the spent outputs. For this reason, the\n`kernel_get_block_undo_size(...)` function is added to the header for\nretrieving the size of the transaction undo data vector, as well as the\n`kernel_get_transaction_undo_size(...) function for retrieving the size\nof each spent outputs vector contained within each transaction undo data\nentry.

This is arguably safer, since we don't completely rely on the null terminator for safety.\r\n* Removed '\\n' newlines in the log calls in the kernel wrapper calls.\r\n* Added the `progress` callback back again. I disabled it some time ago, and forgot to add it back again.\r\n* Use string views instead of `const char*` in the c++ wrapper.",

This context\n+ * offers only limited functionality. It detects and self-checks the correct\n+ * sha256 implementation, initializes the random number generator and\n+ * self-checks the secp256k1 static context. It is used internally for otherwise\n+ * \"context-free\" operations.\n+ *\n+ * The user can create their own context for passing it to state-rich validation\n+ * functions and holding callbacks for kernel events.\n+ *\n+ * ------ Error handling ------\n+ *\n+ * Functions communicate an error through their return types, usually returning\n+ * a nullptr, or false if an error is encountered. Additionally, verification\n+ * functions, e.g. for scripts, may communicate more detailed error information\n+ * through status code out parameters.\n+ *\n+ * Fine-grained validation information is communicated through the validation\n+ * interface.\n+ *\n+ * The kernel notifications issue callbacks for errors. These are usually\n+ * indicative of a system error. If such an error is issued, it is recommended\n+ * to halt and tear down the existing kernel objects. Remediating the error may\n+ * require system intervention by the user.\n+ *\n+ * ------ Pointer and argument conventions ------\n+ *\n+ * The user is responsible for de-allocating the memory owned by pointers\n+ * returned by functions. Typically pointers returned by *_create(...) functions\n+ * can be de-allocated by corresponding *_destroy(...) functions.\n+ *\n+ * Pointer arguments make no assumptions on their lifetime. Once the function\n+ * returns the user can safely de-allocate the passed in arguments.\n+ *\n+ * Pointers passed by callbacks are not owned by the user and are only valid for\n+ * the duration of it.

An alternative approach would be to extend the `kernel_context_options_create` to take a (nullable) `kernel_ChainParameters*`, and remove these ~unsafe modifiers altogether? I think that would have the benefit of:\r\n- removing a whole category of bugs where users set options at the wrong time (i.e. too late), silently leading to buggy behaviour\r\n- making it easier to see which options can (should) be set, without having to first have read the entire documentation\r\n\r\nThis concern also applies to e.g.:\r\n- `kernel_context_options_set_notifications`\r\n- `kernel_validation_interface_register`",

Besides, it may be relevant to know what the library is instantiating internally in case there is some sort of conflict.\r\n\r\nThere is an exception here with the validation interface, and I've taken several attempts to come up with a nice way to tie it into the option pattern as well.

The actual object only gets configured once by the options during its instantion. It can't be changed later on, so there is no concern that users could set something at the wrong time. Having to set options as arguments in their creation function is not a clear win in my eyes either. There are use-cases, for example using the kernel only as a data reader, where the notifications are useless. Likewise defaulting to mainnet seems sane to me too. It also does not integrate well with the \"builder pattern\" which is common in a bunch of other languages.",

Additionally, verification\n+ * functions, e.g. for scripts, may communicate more detailed error information\n+ * through status code out parameters.\n+ *\n+ * Fine-grained validation information is communicated through the validation\n+ * interface.\n+ *\n+ * The kernel notifications issue callbacks for errors.

This static\n+ * context offers only limited functionality. It detects and self-checks the\n+ * correct sha256 implementation, initializes the random number generator and\n+ * self-checks the secp256k1 static context.

Additionally, verification\n+ * functions, e.g. for scripts, may communicate more detailed error information\n+ * through status code out parameters.\n+ *\n+ * Fine-grained validation information is communicated through the validation\n+ * interface.\n+ *\n+ * The kernel notifications issue callbacks for errors. These are usually\n+ * indicative of a system error. If such an error is issued, it is recommended\n+ * to halt and tear down the existing kernel objects. Remediating the error may\n+ * require system intervention by the user.\n+ *\n+ * ------ Pointer and argument conventions ------\n+ *\n+ * The user is responsible for de-allocating the memory owned by pointers\n+ * returned by functions. Typically pointers returned by *_create(...) functions\n+ * can be de-allocated by corresponding *_destroy(...) functions.\n+ *\n+ * A function that takes pointer arguments makes no assumptions on their\n+ * lifetime.

      "body": "We discussed during the last workshop that ideally we don't have any status codes here at all. But the problem is annoying to tackle. You'd probably want to pass this function a script verify object that has already passed through the required pre-checks. But then you have to either copy the objects into this object, or give ownership up to that object, which I don't think is desirable. The alternative to that is having a function with the same signature that you can call to check the arguments. But then you're forced to check them here again. I'm coming around to the option of replacing the status codes with log messages, but then we're sacrificing a bit of responsiveness to the developer.\r\n\r\nEdit: I also think that because this is probably going to be the most low-level verification function we expose here, populating the `ScriptError_t` enum here and returning that instead might be much more interesting. I wanted to hold off on this a bit though, so did not do that yet.",

      "body": "> You'd probably want to pass this function a script verify object that has already passed through the required pre-checks.\r\n\r\nI 100% agree with this approach. Adding extra types makes the API more cumbersome to use, but I think it does make it more safe, and the extra verbosity should be quite easy to hide in client libraries.\r\n\r\n> But then you're forced to check them here again.\r\n\r\nI think that can be avoided by having the prechecks function return a `ScriptPreChecksPassed*` (which references the object it verified, but doesn't copy it) and then requiring that as an extra argument (extra as a way to address lifetime issues) to the `kernel_verify_script` function? This doesn't prevent runtime issues (e.g. re-using `PreChecksPassed` pointers, which is easily verifiable at runtime) or segfaults, but at least it adds some compile-time checks to guide the user to using the API safely, and it can be done without any copies or changing ownership?\r\n\r\n> What do you think of doing something like this instead: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commit/6323d7b072de5b13ab25aaa29e02332c44808b62\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced. I think not requiring the user to deal with status codes (or strings) is a good philosophy, but if it's optional anyway, then passing a bool to add a log entry feels like a much worse interface? And I think it's inferior to this approach:\r\n\r\n> The alternative to that is having a function with the same signature that you can call to check the arguments.",

Relying on NUL-termination means that the memory size is effectively unrestricted, making it impossible to do some checks safely. This is (with lesser urgency) also true for other languages like Python that represent strings as pointer+length.\r\n\r\nAs we internally use C++ strings and not C string APIs this seems straightforward to offer.",
