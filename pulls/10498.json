Furthermore `static_cast<T>(...)` allows for easier grepping of casts.\r\n\r\nFor a more thorough discussion, see [\"ES.49: If you must use a cast, use a named cast\"](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#es49-if-you-must-use-a-cast-use-a-named-cast) in the C++ Core Guidelines (Stroustrup & Sutter).",

I went ahead and made all float <-> int conversion outside of test/qt explicit (test only had one or two more, Qt had quite a few, including many in the Qt headers themselves) and added overloads to CFeeRate to force callers to do an explicit round themselves. Easy to test with -Wfloat-conversion.",

Furthermore static_cast<T>(...) allows for easier grepping of casts.\r\n\r\nFor a more thorough discussion, see \"ES.49: If you must use a cast, use a named cast\"\r\nin the C++ Core Guidelines (Stroustrup & Sutter).\r\n```\r\n\r\nModern tooling, specifically `-Wold-style-cast` can enable us to enforce never using C-style casts. I believe this is especially important due to the number of C-style casts the codebase is currently being used as a reinterpret_cast. reinterpret_casts are especially dangerous, and should never be done via C-style casts.\r\n\r\nUpdate the docs to suggest the use of named cast or functional casts.",
