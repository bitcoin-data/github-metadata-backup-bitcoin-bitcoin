Furthermore `static_cast<T>(...)` allows for easier grepping of casts.\r\n\r\nFor a more thorough discussion, see [\"ES.49: If you must use a cast, use a named cast\"](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#es49-if-you-must-use-a-cast-use-a-named-cast) in the C++ Core Guidelines (Stroustrup & Sutter).",
