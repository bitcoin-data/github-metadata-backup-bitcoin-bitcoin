It only works with witness UTXOs because full transactions (as would be needed for non-witness UTXOs) are not available unless txindex is enabled.\r\n\r\n`joinpsbts` joins the inputs from multiple distinct PSBTs into one PSBT. e.g. if PSBT 1 has inputs 1 and 2, and PSBT 2 has inputs 3 and 4, `joinpsbts` would create a new PSBT with inputs 1, 2, 3, and 4.\r\n\r\n`analyzepsbt` analyzes a PSBT and determines the current state of it and all of its inputs, and the next step that needs to be done.",

The mock database environment will now go out of scope and be reset on destruction so there is no need to call BerkeleyEnvironment::Reset() during wallet construction to clear out prior state.\r\n\r\nThis change does affect bitcoin behavior slightly. On startup, instead of same wallet environments staying open throughout VerifyWallets() and OpenWallets() calls, VerifyWallets() will open and close an environment once for each wallet, and OpenWallets() will create its own environment(s) later.\r\n",

The PR author will then add it with probability ~100 % before PR merge since `explicit` is the reasonable post-C++11 default which we explicitly recommend in the developer notes:\r\n\r\n> **By default, declare single-argument constructors explicit.**\r\n> \r\n> Rationale: This is a precaution to avoid unintended conversions that might arise when single-argument constructors are used as implicit conversion functions.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most common review comments in my experience. IMO it is better to have it automatically and mechanically fixed by the PR author before human review takes place to minimise the time spent by human reviewers on dull \"mechanical review work\".\r\n\r\nRationale directly from the Bible's Old Testament^W^W^WC++ Core Guidelines with editors Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter:\r\n\r\n> **[C.46](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c46-by-default-declare-single-argument-constructors-explicit): By default, declare single-argument constructors explicit**\r\n> …\r\n> **Reason:** To avoid unintended conversions.\r\n> …\r\n> **Enforcement:** (Simple) Single-argument constructors should be declared explicit. Good single argument non-explicit constructors are rare in most code based. Warn for all that are not on a “positive list”.\r\n\r\n:-)",

The actual opening is still executed in the wallet controller thread, but in a different way. Considering the current minimum Qt version, the best way to run a function in a different thread is to use `QTimer::singleShot(0, worker, () { ... })` where `worker` is an object in a different thread. With Qt 5.10, the correct way is to use `QMetaObject::invokeMethod`.\r\n\r\nThis change also removes from `bitcoingui.cpp` the handling of loading messages and progress dialog.",
