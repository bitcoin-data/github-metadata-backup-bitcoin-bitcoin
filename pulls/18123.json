    "body": "Poll function was wrongly setting cached height to the current chain height instead of the chain height at the time of polling.\r\n\r\nThis bug could cause balances to appear out of date, and was first introduced https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/a0704a8996bb950ae3c4d5b5a30e9dfe34cde1d3#diff-2e3836af182cfb375329c3463ffd91f8L117. Before that commit, there wasn't a problem because cs_main was held during the poll update.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the problem should be rare. But if 8937d99ce81a27ae5e1012a28323c0e26d89c50b from #17954 were merged, the problem would get worse, because the wrong cachedNumBlocks value would be set if the wallet was polled in the interval between a block being connected and it processing the BlockConnected notification.\r\n\r\nMarcoFalke also points out that a0704a8996b could lead to GUI hangs as well, because previously the pollBalanceChanged method, which runs on the GUI thread, would only make a nonblocking TRY_LOCK(cs_main) call, but after could make blocking LOCK(cs_main) calls, potentially locking up the GUI.\r\n\r\nThanks to John Newbery for finding this bug this while reviewing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17954.\r\n",

      "message": "gui: Fix race in WalletModel::pollBalanceChanged\n\nPoll function was wrongly setting cached height to the current chain height\ninstead of the chain height at the time of polling.\n\nThis bug could cause balances to appear out of date, and was first introduced\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/a0704a8996bb950ae3c4d5b5a30e9dfe34cde1d3#r378452145\nBefore that commit, there wasn't a problem because cs_main was held during the\npoll update.\n\nCurrently, the problem should be rare. But if\n8937d99ce81a27ae5e1012a28323c0e26d89c50b from #17954 were merged, the problem\nwould get worse, because the wrong cachedNumBlocks value would be set if the\nwallet was polled in the interval between a block being connected and it\nprocessing the BlockConnected notification.\n\nMarcoFalke <falke.marco@gmail.com> also points out that a0704a8996b could lead\nto GUI hangs as well, because previously the pollBalanceChanged method, which\nruns on the GUI thread, would only make a nonblocking TRY_LOCK(cs_main) call,\nbut after could make blocking LOCK(cs_main) calls, potentially locking up the\nGUI.\n\nThanks to John Newbery <john@johnnewbery.com> for finding this bug this while\nreviewing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17954.",

          "body": "Rationale:\r\n\r\nThe height based polling in the GUI is an issue on chain reorgs. Any new tip signal with the same height as the one that it's cached in the model was not triggering the GUI update (interpreting it as the same same block when it could receive a different one). Ending up with bad information presented in the GUI.\r\n\r\nThis PR essentially changes the last cached height to be a last cached block hash.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOld historical information of this PR.\r\n\r\nAs the tip height is cached and updated via signaling in clientModel, there is no need to continue locking `cs_main` on every balance poll (`m_node.getNumBlocks()` method call).\r\n\r\nExtra topic:\r\n\r\nWould suggest to change the `cachedNumBlocks` field inside `walletModel` to a more understandable name, maybe `nLastBalanceUpdateHeight`.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, this will have the equal height reorg issue mentioned [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17905#issuecomment-577324304), whatever is presented to fix it, this should use the same flow too.\r\n\r\n**[Edit - 24/01/2020]**\r\n\r\nHave added #[17905](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17905#issuecomment-577324304) comment fix here too.",

          "title": "Refactor: separate gui from wallet and node",
          "body": "This is a refactoring PR that does not change behavior in any way. This change:\r\n\r\n1. Creates abstract [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-local/src/interface/node.h) and [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-local/src/interface/wallet.h) interfaces in [`src/interface/`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc-local/src/interface)\r\n1. Updates Qt code to call the new interfaces. This largely consists of diffs of the form:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    InitLogging();\r\n-    InitParameterInteraction();\r\n+    node.initLogging();\r\n+    node.initParameterInteraction();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change allows followup PR #10102 (makes `bitcoin-qt` control `bitcoind` over an IPC socket) to work without any significant updates to Qt code. Additionally:\r\n\r\n* It provides a single place to describe the interface between GUI and daemon code.\r\n* It can make better GUI testing possible, because Node and Wallet objects have virtual methods that can be overloaded for mocking.\r\n* It can be used to help make the GUI more responsive (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10504)\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\n* I used python scripts [hide-globals.py](https://github.com/ryanofsky/home/blob/master/src/2017/hide-globals/hide-globals.py) and [replace-syms.py](https://github.com/ryanofsky/home/blob/master/src/2017/hide-globals/replace-syms.py) to identify all the places where Qt code was accessing libbitcoin global variables and calling functions accessing those global variables.\r\n* These changes were originally part of #10102. Thanks to @JeremyRubin for the suggestion of splitting them out.\r\n\r\nCommits:\r\n\r\n- [`ea73b84d2d` Add src/interface/README.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/ea73b84d2ddde22487dee0f71d7a619051e067f2)\r\n- [`71e0d90876` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/bitcoin.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/71e0d90876efd11e2a4aeb8f3f806c5a1fd54b42)\r\n- [`c0f2756be5` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/optionsmodel.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/c0f2756be517feddacd7c6b89b9faa888b3fef8e)\r\n- [`3d619e9d36` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/bitcoingui.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/3d619e9d3658e36cba4a19a5bed33e5538317b27)\r\n- [`c2f672fb19` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/utilitydialog.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/c2f672fb1960399389dea9cdd8f76d7156c2c88b)\r\n- [`5fba3af21e` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/splashscreen.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/5fba3af21e44ab7552c57782de430c1f4cfd6697)\r\n- [`fe6f27e6ea` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/clientmodel.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/fe6f27e6ea68a139d3a98b30a53706008ef8b132)\r\n- [`d7c2c95948` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/intro.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/d7c2c9594897c39df6739b92610dfb5a7a1cb3ec)\r\n- [`e0b66a3b7c` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/peertablemodel.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/e0b66a3b7c5d3a079636d61fcf611bb6b36c7bc1)\r\n- [`3034a462a5` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/bantablemodel.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/3034a462a5d30144cf0ec801d07f0c8c36d560f3)\r\n- [`582daf6d22` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/rpcconsole.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/582daf6d22da5394d02a12003b9542d9f5865ae2)\r\n- [`90d4640b7e` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/optionsdialog.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/90d4640b7eff3154a0750c5acb52d39bd41e0bbb)\r\n- [`a0704a8996` Remove most direct bitcoin calls from qt/walletmodel.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/a0704a8996bb950ae3c4d5b5a30e9dfe34cde1d3)\r\n- [`827de038ab` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/coincontroldialog.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/827de038ab6fa58aa3d46151eb2f8dc6add7743e)\r\n- [`3ec2ebcd9b` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/addresstablemodel.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/3ec2ebcd9b4beb4277f1f4791c6acbc538784f70)\r\n- [`3cab2ce5f9` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/paymentserver.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/3cab2ce5f9e159ad5a2e9ed682f28121b5248580)\r\n- [`58845587e1` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt transaction table files](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/58845587e11140e81f087a74c3db76a4d1fc3a1a)\r\n- [`e872c93ee8` Remove direct bitcoin access from qt/guiutil.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/e872c93ee87477130fb877da1a536b4c693bbab9)\r\n- [`56f33ca349` Remove direct bitcoin calls from qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/56f33ca349b3721a15fce3bf0b6d4fd7fd788970)\r\n- [`9a61eed1fc` Use WalletBalances struct in Qt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/9a61eed1fcc16ddcedc315045f470e1958b0760b)\r\n- [`9960137697` Add developer notes about blocking GUI code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10244/commits/996013769711bd507cdcd6dde88cbd59fcd4fbad)",
