    "body": "### **Issue:**\r\n\r\nSimply `DecodeDestination` does not handle errors where the user inputs a valid address for the wrong network. _e.x. testnet while running client on mainnet_  \r\n\r\nThe current error `not a valid Bech32 or Base58 encoding` for a valid address on a different network is entirely incorrect. This is because of the is_bech32 variable used at the core of `DecodeDestination` logic  only checks that the prefix matches. If it doesn't it just starts running everything as `DecodeBase58Check` regardless if the Bech32 String was actually valid.\r\n\r\n### **Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nBase58 Addresses with invalid prefixes will now display network and expected values.\r\n\r\n- previous: `Invalid or unsupported Base58-encoded address.`\r\n- 27260 `Invalid or unsupported Base58 testnet address. Expected prefix m, n, or 2`\r\n\r\nBech32 Addresses with invalid prefixes will now display network and expected values. The current from of the error is completely incorrect when the user passes valid Bech32 for the wrong network.\r\n\r\n- previous: `Invalid or unsupported Segwit (Bech32) or Base58 encoding.`\r\n- 27260: `Invalid chain prefix for testnet. Expected tb got bc`\r\n\r\n### **Reference**\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26290\r\n### **Implementation :**\r\nSimply put, don't delay the attempt to decode the string as Bech32 using Bech32::Decode(str). This takes a minimal amount CPU cycles to perform and is acceptable to do since this operation is not performed often. \r\n\r\nOnce you get the decoding status of the string as bech32, do the same with DecodeBase58 using a len of 100 and DecodeBase58Check. This gives you enough information to start properly decoding errors. \r\n\r\nAfter you have decoded the address in various formats run though the logic and display errors for invalid addresses with the network names and expected values when the user just misses the prefix.\r\n\r\n**Update 1**: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260#issuecomment-1628375439\r\n\r\n### **Other Notes**\r\n\r\n- Previous errors had inconsistencies such as random periods in some errors and not others. Using the word encoded in some errors and not others. This has been resolved.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

      "body": "This PR has had some substantial updates applied since it's first inception. \r\n\r\n1. Deterministically calculated base58 prefixes with the function ```EncodedPrefixesFromBase58Prefix```\r\n\r\n3. This PR now greatly improves the accuracy of error reporting as seen in the updates to 3d0a5c37e9ccedfa4ecfaa48eeeca1ada5b4eec1 where many valid bech32 tests are fed through the base58 section of the `DecodeDestination` function. This line gives a great example of how this PR addresses this from the current\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/79e8247ddb166f9b980f40249b7372a502402a4d/test/functional/rpc_validateaddress.py#L11-L17 Into a much more accurate representaion.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f2e548f6276386c27a60336cf12665d5e316fb7/test/functional/rpc_validateaddress.py#L11-L17 This follows up even further to the changes made in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27727\r\n\r\n4. A function `ChainTypeToDisplayString(ChainType chain)` has been added to give user facing display names for the various chains a Bitcoin client can attach themselves to. \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f2e548f6276386c27a60336cf12665d5e316fb7/src/util/chaintype.cpp#L11-L23\r\n\r\nAs a note this PR solves a fundamental issue in the current address validation scheme that if a user inputs anything bech32 with the wrong hrp it's immediately treated as base58 even though it is valid bech32.\r\n",

Note to other reviewers: see discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260#discussion_r1567767610 for why the prefixes are hardcoded instead of derived.\r\n\r\nThe main commit fd02e7650f6410824a64f1403a98583b7ec6b0dd might be easier to review if you split it up. For example one commit that improves the base58 vs bech32 detection, another commit that that improves base58 error handling and finally one for bech32.\r\n\r\nRe last commit message, you can leave this out:\r\n\r\n> A complete refactor of the previous pull to simplify logic and reduce the\r\nchance of technical debt.\r\n\r\nOnce this PR is merged, it will unclear what \"previous pull\" refers to.",

Per the request of @Sjors .\r\n\r\n There also was a substantial effort to create a proper set of functional tests that actually test properly. Examples would be that now with the correct network decoding some errors became network aware and as such needed to be converted to the correct network. Example would be the bech32 padding issue. _test/functional/rpc_validateaddress.py line 55_\r\n\r\nI will be working on addressing some of the more recent comments in the coming day.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRusseree",
