    "body": "### **Issue:**\r\n\r\nSimply `DecodeDestination` does not handle errors where the user inputs a valid address for the wrong network. _e.x. testnet while running client on mainnet_  \r\n\r\nThe current error `not a valid Bech32 or Base58 encoding` for a valid address on a different network is entirely incorrect. This is because of the is_bech32 variable used at the core of `DecodeDestination` logic  only checks that the prefix matches. If it doesn't it just starts running everything as `DecodeBase58Check` regardless if the Bech32 String was actually valid.\r\n\r\n### **Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nBase58 Addresses with invalid prefixes will now display network and expected values.\r\n\r\n- previous: `Invalid or unsupported Base58-encoded address.`\r\n- 27260 `Invalid or unsupported Base58 testnet address. Expected prefix m, n, or 2`\r\n\r\nBech32 Addresses with invalid prefixes will now display network and expected values. The current from of the error is completely incorrect when the user passes valid Bech32 for the wrong network.\r\n\r\n- previous: `Invalid or unsupported Segwit (Bech32) or Base58 encoding.`\r\n- 27260: `Invalid chain prefix for testnet. Expected tb got bc`\r\n\r\n### **Reference**\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26290\r\n### **Implementation :**\r\nSimply put, don't delay the attempt to decode the string as Bech32 using Bech32::Decode(str). This takes a minimal amount CPU cycles to perform and is acceptable to do since this operation is not performed often. \r\n\r\nOnce you get the decoding status of the string as bech32, do the same with DecodeBase58 using a len of 100 and DecodeBase58Check. This gives you enough information to start properly decoding errors. \r\n\r\nAfter you have decoded the address in various formats run though the logic and display errors for invalid addresses with the network names and expected values when the user just misses the prefix.\r\n\r\n**Update 1**: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260#issuecomment-1628375439\r\n\r\n### **Other Notes**\r\n\r\n- Previous errors had inconsistencies such as random periods in some errors and not others. Using the word encoded in some errors and not others. This has been resolved.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

Also, use the BIP 173 and BIP 350 test vectors.",

      "body": "This PR has had some substantial updates applied since it's first inception. \r\n\r\n1. Deterministically calculated base58 prefixes with the function ```EncodedPrefixesFromBase58Prefix```\r\n\r\n3. This PR now greatly improves the accuracy of error reporting as seen in the updates to 3d0a5c37e9ccedfa4ecfaa48eeeca1ada5b4eec1 where many valid bech32 tests are fed through the base58 section of the `DecodeDestination` function. This line gives a great example of how this PR addresses this from the current\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/79e8247ddb166f9b980f40249b7372a502402a4d/test/functional/rpc_validateaddress.py#L11-L17 Into a much more accurate representaion.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f2e548f6276386c27a60336cf12665d5e316fb7/test/functional/rpc_validateaddress.py#L11-L17 This follows up even further to the changes made in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27727\r\n\r\n4. A function `ChainTypeToDisplayString(ChainType chain)` has been added to give user facing display names for the various chains a Bitcoin client can attach themselves to. \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f2e548f6276386c27a60336cf12665d5e316fb7/src/util/chaintype.cpp#L11-L23\r\n\r\nAs a note this PR solves a fundamental issue in the current address validation scheme that if a user inputs anything bech32 with the wrong hrp it's immediately treated as base58 even though it is valid bech32.\r\n",

Not having a too short case causes a fall though into the conditions of ```\"Invalid separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSimply add a check for a minimum Bech32 string size after or during the check for the maximum size which is already implemented.\r\n\r\nCascading effects of this would be seen in DecodeDestination if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/32c15237b656209b932c5d6d2e20736c0e3d5a34/src/key_io.cpp#L85-L86 was patched to not consider bech32 invalid then attempt to Base58Decode it becuase of the incorrect HRP for the current chain.\r\n\r\nReferenced in \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26290\r\n\r\nPR \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nYou could case this into other logic on a case by case basis in code. Example make a speical case inside DecodeDestination to display the correct error message to the user by if LocateErrors returns 'Invalid ```\"separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"``` then you check to see if the string is to short.\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nAs an aside there is already a check for string length greater than 90 (MAX LEN)\r\n\r\nin src/test/bech32_tests.cpp both [\"10a06t8\",\"1qzzfhee\"] produce ```{\"Invalid separator position\", {0}}``` The former is non conformant to BIP173 due not even having enough chars to represent a BASE32 string and the second genuinely has a wrong separator position.

Not having a too short case causes a fall though into the conditions of ```\"Invalid separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nSimply add a check for a minimum Bech32 string size after or during the check for the maximum size which is already implemented.\r\n\r\nCascading effects of this would be seen in DecodeDestination if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/32c15237b656209b932c5d6d2e20736c0e3d5a34/src/key_io.cpp#L85-L86 was patched to not consider bech32 invalid then attempt to Base58Decode it becuase of the incorrect HRP for the current chain.\r\n\r\nReferenced in \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26290\r\n\r\nPR \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nYou could case this into other logic on a case by case basis in code. Example make a speical case inside DecodeDestination to display the correct error message to the user by if LocateErrors returns 'Invalid ```\"separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"``` then you check to see if the string is to short.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nAs an aside there is already a check for string length greater than 90 (MAX LEN)\r\n\r\nin src/test/bech32_tests.cpp both [\"10a06t8\",\"1qzzfhee\"] produce ```{\"Invalid separator position\", {0}}``` The former is non conformant to BIP173 due not even having enough chars to represent a BASE32 string and the second genuinely has a wrong separator position. \r\n\r\nAdding this case would make DecodeDestination more accurate for anyone who wants to to implement bech32.{cpp,h}\r\n\r\n\r\n### A comparison of this PRs error vs the current 25.99 error for Bech32 string that does not meet the minimum length requirement.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/3104223/2b975904-3a65-46b9-bee2-99c64eae59b9)\r\n\r\n",

This results in some things that would have given an address for P2PK scripts to no longer do so. This is arguably more correct.\r\n\r\n`ExtractDestination`'s behavior is slightly changed for the above. It now returns `true` for those destinations that have addresses, so P2PK scripts now result in `false`. Even though it returns false for `CNoDestination`, the script will now be included in that `CNoDestination`.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #28244",

This PR breaks up the various components and renames the files to clearly separate everything.\r\n\r\n* `CTxDestination` is moved to a new file `src/addresstype.{cpp/h}`\r\n* `TaprootSpendData` and `TaprootBuilder` (and their utility functions and structs) are moved to `SigningProvider` as these are used only during signing.\r\n* `CScriptID` is moved to `script/script.h` to be next to `CScript`.\r\n* `MANDATORY_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS` is moved to `interpreter.h`\r\n* The parameters `DEFAULT_ACCEPT_DATACARRIER` and `MAX_OP_RETURN_RELAY` are moved to `policy.h`\r\n* `standard.{cpp/h}` is renamed to `solver.{cpp/h}` since that's all that's left in the file after the above moves",

The project is tracked in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28536\r\n\r\n## BIP352\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",

With this patch, they are no longer required to include in order to use the libbitcoinkernel library. This also allows for the removal of the `compat.h` header from the kernel headers.\r\n\r\nAs an added future benefit it also reduces the number of of kernel headers that include the platform specific `bitcoin-config.h`.\r\n\r\nFor those interested, the currently required kernel headers can be inspected visually with the [sourcetrail](https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail) tool by looking at the required includes of `bitcoin-chainstate.cpp`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587), namely its stage 1 step 3: Decouple most non-consensus headers from libbitcoinkernel.\r\n",

Light client support, see [BIP 352](https://github.com/josibake/bips/blob/silent-payments-bip/bip-0352.mediawiki#user-content-Tweak_Data)\r\n2. A more thorough check than the test vectors; e.g. by comparing a checksum of the index for all of mainnet.\r\n\r\nBased on the index that was originally part of #24897.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] check correctness against another implementation\r\n- [ ] make `-silentpaymentindex=0` mean off (default), `-silentpaymentindex=v0` on\r\n- [ ] figure out how to do versioning (make the index flexible enough, or just rebuild the index at the next version)\r\n- [ ] remove dependency on wallet (move `GetSilentPaymentsTweakDataFromTxInputs` and everything it needs out of the wallet)\r\n- [ ] cleanup various TODO's in the code\r\n- [ ] brainstorm updating index when outputs are spent\r\n- add tests\r\n  - [ ] that a reorg adds the new blocks (and it's fine to keep the old one) ",

This is done by using ```IsFullyValid()``` to check that the public key(s) for the outpoints script are valid. This trims nearly 20K outpoints from the UTXO set at height 805618. https://gist.github.com/russeree/85fb9519e0a1fc166177a6d5e0e15be2  \r\n\r\nA side effect of this PR is it removes the use case for uncompressed public keys through standard tx types to store arbitrary data in the UTXO set.\r\n\r\n### P2PK\r\nP2PK outpoints with a single pubkey that is invalid can by flagged as unspendable becuase the public key does not exist on the SECP256K1 curve and thus no private key exists to make OP_CHECKSIG evaluate to true. \r\n\r\nScript must be in the format of ```OP_PUSHBBYTES PUBKEY OP_CHECKSIG(VERIFY)```\r\n\r\n### P2MS\r\nP2MS outpoints that do not have enough valid public keys to meet the threshold. where (n-k < m) where k is the number of invalid public keys. \r\n\r\nScript must be in the format of ```OP_(N) PUBKEY1 ....

          "body": "This PR implements receiving silent payment transactions through the use of a new `ScriptPubKeyMan` type: `SilentPaymentsSPKM`. This is a descriptor wallet only feature, although it does not use descriptors.\r\n\r\nThis is an optional feature, so the only way to use it is to create a new wallet with `createwallet` with `silent_payments=true`. Such wallets will have a single `SilentPaymentsSPKM` that is used for both receiving and change. Since silent payments only have a single address, repeated calls to `getnewaddress` and `getrawchangeaddress` always return the same address, however the receiving and change addresses are different, see the BIP for how the change is generated.\r\n\r\nSince silent payments requires the spent coins in order to extract public keys from them, `TransactionAddedToMempool` is modified to also provide that information. For scanning blocks, the wallet will retrieve that information from the undo data. Additionally, when rescanning, a silent payments wallet must use the slow rescan method.\r\n\r\nThe labels feature has not been fully implemented yet and is left for a followup.\r\n\r\nBased on #28122 and #28201 \r\n\r\nAlternative to #28202",

ISTM it would be a lot simpler to just hard code them into chainparams anyways. It's not as if the prefixes will ever change, and new ones are unlikely to be added.\r\n\r\nMerging this code seems like an additional maintenance burden for very little gain.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you insist on keeping this code, it should be placed into its final location when introduced instead of moved in the last commit.",

I would agree chainparams would be the place to implement a hardcoded (char[], stringview) prefix. Another advantage is that lookup is likely faster; so if a user is frequently getting errors it may save a few them a few cycles. ",
