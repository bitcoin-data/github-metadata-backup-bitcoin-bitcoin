    "body": "### **Issue:**\r\n\r\nSimply `DecodeDestination` does not handle errors where the user inputs a valid address for the wrong network. _e.x. testnet while running client on mainnet_  \r\n\r\nThe current error `not a valid Bech32 or Base58 encoding` for a valid address on a different network is entirely incorrect. This is because of the is_bech32 variable used at the core of `DecodeDestination` logic  only checks that the prefix matches. If it doesn't it just starts running everything as `DecodeBase58Check` regardless if the Bech32 String was actually valid.\r\n\r\n### **Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nBase58 Addresses with invalid prefixes now display network and expected values.\r\n\r\n- previous: `Invalid or unsupported Base58-encoded address.`\r\n- 27260 `Invalid or unsupported Base58 testnet address. Expected prefix m, n, or 2`\r\n\r\nBech32 Addresses with invalid prefixes now display network and expected values. The current from of the error is completely incorrect when the user passes valid Bech32 for the wrong network.\r\n\r\n- previous: `Invalid or unsupported Segwit (Bech32) or Base58 encoding.`\r\n- 27260: `Invalid chain prefix for testnet. Expected tb got bc`\r\n\r\n### **Reference**\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26290\r\n### **Implementation :**\r\nSimply put, don't delay the attempt to decode the string as Bech32 using Bech32::Decode(str). This takes a minimal amount cpu cycles to perform and is acceptable to do since this operation is not performed often. \r\n\r\nOnce you get the decoding status of the string as bech32, do the same for DecodeBase58 with a len of 100 and DecodeBase58Check. This gives you nearly the entire state needed to start properly decoding errors. There is one additional variable added to the logic for strings that contain bech32 chars that just don't pass for another reason. _e.x. checksum_\r\n\r\nAfter that run though the logic and display errors with the network names and expected values when the user just misses the prefix.\r\n\r\n**Update 1**: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260#issuecomment-1628375439\r\n\r\n### **Other Notes**\r\n\r\n- Previous errors had inconsistencies such as random periods in some errors and not others. Using the word encoded in some errors and not others. This has been resolved.\r\n- Passes the extended functional test suite.\r\n- I used a function scoped struct to keep track of the state\r\n- Due to the need to access struct members with dot operators I opted to create direct bindings to the members of the struct to keep the code readable.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

Deterministically calculated base58 prefixes with the function ```EncodedPrefixesFromBase58Prefix```\r\n\r\n3. This PR now greatly improves the accuracy of error reporting as seen in the updates to 3d0a5c37e9ccedfa4ecfaa48eeeca1ada5b4eec1 where many valid bech32 tests are fed through the base58 section of the `DecodeDestination` function. This line gives a great example of how this PR addresses this from the current\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/79e8247ddb166f9b980f40249b7372a502402a4d/test/functional/rpc_validateaddress.py#L11-L17 Into a much more accurate representaion.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f2e548f6276386c27a60336cf12665d5e316fb7/test/functional/rpc_validateaddress.py#L11-L17 This follows up even further to the changes made in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27727\r\n\r\n4. A function `ChainTypeToDisplayString(ChainType chain)` has been added to give user facing display names for the various chains a Bitcoin client can attach themselves to. \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f2e548f6276386c27a60336cf12665d5e316fb7/src/util/chaintype.cpp#L11-L23\r\n\r\nAs a note this PR solves a fundamental issue in the current address validation scheme that if a user inputs anything bech32 with the wrong hrp it's immediately treated as base58 even though it is valid bech32.\r\n",

This PR extracts that data storage handling into a separate container class `Bag`. This is pure refactoring, the result should have a better separation of concerns, adds tests for the new container, and makes it now easier to separately test and optimize the container.",

Not having a too short case causes a fall though into the conditions of ```\"Invalid separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSimply add a check for a minimum Bech32 string size after or during the check for the maximum size which is already implemented.\r\n\r\nCascading effects of this would be seen in DecodeDestination if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/32c15237b656209b932c5d6d2e20736c0e3d5a34/src/key_io.cpp#L85-L86 was patched to not consider bech32 invalid then attempt to Base58Decode it becuase of the incorrect HRP for the current chain.\r\n\r\nReferenced in \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26290\r\n\r\nPR \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nYou could case this into other logic on a case by case basis in code. Example make a speical case inside DecodeDestination to display the correct error message to the user by if LocateErrors returns 'Invalid ```\"separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"``` then you check to see if the string is to short.\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nAs an aside there is already a check for string length greater than 90 (MAX LEN)\r\n\r\nin src/test/bech32_tests.cpp both [\"10a06t8\",\"1qzzfhee\"] produce ```{\"Invalid separator position\", {0}}``` The former is non conformant to BIP173 due not even having enough chars to represent a BASE32 string and the second genuinely has a wrong separator position.

Not having a too short case causes a fall though into the conditions of ```\"Invalid separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nSimply add a check for a minimum Bech32 string size after or during the check for the maximum size which is already implemented.\r\n\r\nCascading effects of this would be seen in DecodeDestination if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/32c15237b656209b932c5d6d2e20736c0e3d5a34/src/key_io.cpp#L85-L86 was patched to not consider bech32 invalid then attempt to Base58Decode it becuase of the incorrect HRP for the current chain.\r\n\r\nReferenced in \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26290\r\n\r\nPR \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nYou could case this into other logic on a case by case basis in code. Example make a speical case inside DecodeDestination to display the correct error message to the user by if LocateErrors returns 'Invalid ```\"separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"``` then you check to see if the string is to short.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nAs an aside there is already a check for string length greater than 90 (MAX LEN)\r\n\r\nin src/test/bech32_tests.cpp both [\"10a06t8\",\"1qzzfhee\"] produce ```{\"Invalid separator position\", {0}}``` The former is non conformant to BIP173 due not even having enough chars to represent a BASE32 string and the second genuinely has a wrong separator position. \r\n\r\nAdding this case would make DecodeDestination more accurate for anyone who wants to to implement bech32.{cpp,h}\r\n\r\n\r\n### A comparison of this PRs error vs the current 25.99 error for Bech32 string that does not meet the minimum length requirement.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/3104223/2b975904-3a65-46b9-bee2-99c64eae59b9)\r\n\r\n",

      "message": "Improved bech32 and base58 address error handling\n\nThis commit addresses an issue in Bitcoin Core where an incorrect\nbech32 prefix would lead to the address being treated as entirely\ninvalid for both base58 and bech32 encoding, without providing the user\nwith an appropriate error message. Base58 error handling was also improved.\n\nChanges:\n\n - An incorrect bech32 address error message now presents the\n   expected ChainParams hrp and network to the user.\n\n - A Bech32 address with an incorrect ChainParams prefix is\n   not automatically handled as base58, increasing the accuracy\n   and readability of user facing error messages.\n\n - An incorrect base58 address prefix now presents the user with the\n   expected prefixes for the current ChainParams, which are\n   deterministically computed in util/base58address.(cpp/h)\n\n - Functional tests were refactored to reflect the additional accuracy\n   of error messages.\n\n - Added GetChainTypeDisplayString(), which generates a user facing chain\n   type string for \"Bitcoin\", \"testnet\", \"signet\", and \"regtest\". This is\n   used for displaying the user's active chain when displaying errors.\n   As per Luke Dashjr, \"mainnet\" is not used in user facing messages.\n\n - Added Base58PrefixesFromVersionBytes(), which when given a total\n   length in bytes and a base58 prefix will give the user all\n   possible single character prefixes for the encoded base58 string.\n\n - Bech32 error decoding now handles the cases where the input\n   has neither base58 or bech32 characters and the inverse where the\n   input has both valid base58 and bech32 characters.\n\n - Increased code readability through the use of structured bindings.\n\n - Added a multiple separators check to bech32.cpp this is to convert\n   incorrect error messages about a singular separator position into\n   a message that covers multiple separators and their positions.\n\n - Added a minimum length check to bech32.cpp and ErrorLocatiosn message\n   with the locations being a vector of the chars positions up to the\n   minimum length of 8 chars.\n\nA huge thanks to D++ for the extensive contributions\n\nCo-authored-by: D++ <82842780+dplusplus1024@users.noreply.github.com>",

This results in some things that would have given an address for P2PK scripts to no longer do so. This is arguably more correct.\r\n\r\n`ExtractDestination`'s behavior is slightly changed for the above. It now returns `true` for those destinations that have addresses, so P2PK scripts now result in `false`. Even though it returns false for `CNoDestination`, the script will now be included in that `CNoDestination`.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #28244",

It contains a mix of policy parameters, consensus parameters, and utilities only used by the wallet. This PR breaks up the various components and renames the files to clearly separate everything.\r\n\r\n* `CTxDestination` is moved to a new file `src/addresstype.{cpp/h}`\r\n* `TaprootSpendData` and `TaprootBuilder` (and their utility functions and structs) are moved to `SigningProvider` as these are used only during signing.\r\n* `CScriptID` is moved to `script/script.h` to be next to `CScript`.\r\n* `MANDATORY_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS` is moved to `interpreter.h`\r\n* The parameters `DEFAULT_ACCEPT_DATACARRIER` and `MAX_OP_RETURN_RELAY` are moved to `policy.h`\r\n* `standard.{cpp/h}` is renamed to `solver.{cpp/h}` since that's all that's left in the file after the above moves",

          "title": "Silent Payments: Implement BIP352",
          "body": "UPDATE: Rather than having a special encoder and decoder for silent payments, it makes more sense to have `CTxDestination` include a `V0SilentPaymentDestination` type. Some pre-work to make this easier is done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28244 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28246 , which this PR now depends on. If you want to review this PR, please review these two first. One is a move-only refactor, and the other a fairly light refactor with minimal behavior changes.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nThis PR is a child of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27827 and only implements the BIP logic without the wallet code. For the wallet implementations:\r\n* #28201 - implements sending\r\n* #28202 - implements receiving\r\n* #27827 - all three PRs together - this PR is meant for tracking progress and is useful for reviewers who want to compile all three PRs at once for testing\r\n\r\n## BIP352\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",

      "body": "I have changed this to read ```Invalid or unsupported prefix```... testing my own knowledge; The reason you can have an unsupported but still technically valid address would be in the event of a softfork to a new SegWit version? e.x. _a segwit client interpreting a taproot address would say \"invalid\"_ but that is not completely true because the address is valid. Just not supported by the client?\r\n\r\nThis has been resolved in b66e974ac8f21971602051c08df830d14cf3df7e",
