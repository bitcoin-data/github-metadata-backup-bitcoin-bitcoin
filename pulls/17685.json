    "body": "Fix bug in the descriptor parsing fuzzing harness (`descriptor_parse`) by making sure `secp256k1_context_verify` is properly initialized (via `ECCVerifyHandle`).\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nWhen fuzzing `Parse(…)` with `libFuzzer` I eventually reached the test case `combo(020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)`.
