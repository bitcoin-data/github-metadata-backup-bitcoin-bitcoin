    "body": "Part of cluster mempool: #30289 \r\r\n\r\nThis introduces low-level cluster linearization code, including tests and some benchmarks. It is currently not hooked up to anything.\r\n\r\nUltimately, what this PR adds is a function `Linearize` which operates on instances of `DepGraph` (instances of which represent pre-processed transaction clusters) to produce and/or improve linearizations for that cluster.\r\n\r\nTo provide assurance, the code heavily relies on fuzz tests. A novel approach is used here, where the fuzz input is parsed using the serialization.h framework rather than `FuzzedDataProvider`, with a custom serializer/deserializer for `DepGraph` objects. By including serialization, it's possible to ascertain that the format can represent every relevant cluster, as well as potentially permitting the construction of ad-hoc fuzz inputs from clusters (not included in this PR, but used during development).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe `Linearize(depgraph, iteration_limit, rng_seed, old_linearization)` function is an implementation of the (single) [LIMO](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/limo-combining-the-best-parts-of-linearization-search-and-merging/825) algorithm, with the $S$ in every iteration found as the best out of (a) the best remaining ancestor set and (b) randomized computationally-bounded search. It incrementally builds up a linearization by finding good topologically-valid subsets to move to the front, in such a way that the resulting linearization has a diagram that is at least as good as the `old_linearization` passed in (if any).\r\n* Despite using both best ancestor set and search, this is not Double LIMO, as no intersections between these are involved; just the best of the two.\r\n* The `iteration_limit` and `rng_seed` only control the (b) randomized search. Even with 0 iterations, the result will be as good as the old linearization, and the included sets at every point will have a feerate at least as high as the best remaining ancestor set at that point.\r\n\r\nThe search algorithm used in the (b) step is very basic. See #30286 for optimizations to make it more efficient.",
