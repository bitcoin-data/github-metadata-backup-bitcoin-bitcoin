    "body": "Depends on #30160 and #30161. Eventually #28676 will end up being based on this.\r\n\r\nThis introduces low-level optimized cluster linearization code, including tests and some benchmarks. It is currently not hooked up to anything.\r\n\r\nRoughly the commits are organized into 3 groups:\r\n* Repeat of part of #29625.\r\n* Introduce unoptimized versions of candidate finding and linearizations, plus benchmarks and tests.\r\n* Add various optimizations step by step.\r\n\r\nUltimately, what this PR adds is two functions `Linearize` and `PostLinearize`, which operate on instances of `DepGraph` (instances of which represent pre-processed transaction clusters) to produce and/or improve linearizations for that cluster.\r\n\r\nAlong the way two new data structures are introduced (`util/bitset.h` and `util/ringbuffer.h`), which could be useful more broadly. They have their own commits, which include tests.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo provide assurance, the code heavily relies on fuzz tests. A novel approach is used here, where the fuzz input is parsed using the serialization.h framework rather than `FuzzedDataProvider`, with a custom serializer/deserializer for `DepGraph` objects. By including serialization, it's possible to ascertain that the format can represent every relevant cluster, as well as potentially permitting the construction of ad-hoc fuzz inputs from clusters (not included in this PR, but used during development).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor an explanation of the algorithms, see my posts on [linearization](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-to-linearize-your-cluster/303), [LIMO](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/limo-combining-the-best-parts-of-linearization-search-and-merging/825), and [post-linearization](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/linearization-post-processing-o-n-2-fancy-chunking/201) though with a few changes:\r\n* Bottleneck analysis is not performed; my thinking is that it only really helps with clusters that are already relatively cheap to linearize.\r\n* Connected component analysis is performed inside the search algorithm (creating initial work items per component for each candidate, rather than once at a higher level). This duplicates some work but is significantly simpler in implementation.\r\n* Ancestor-set based presplitting inside the search is replaced with using the best ancestor set as one of the LIMO set choices.\r\n* Work items are represented using an included set *inc* and an undefined set *und*, rather than included and excluded.\r\n* Potential sets *pot* are not computed for work items with empty *inc*.",

It's not a full drop-in replacement, as I did not add iteration support which is unnecessary for the intended use case, but nothing prevents adding that if needed.\r\n\r\nEverything is tested through a simulation-based fuzz test that compares the behavior with normal `std::deque` equivalent operations, but for trivially-copyable/destructible types and others.\r\n",
