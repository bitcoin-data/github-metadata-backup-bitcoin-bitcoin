Some of these, such as `-Wunreachable-code-loop-increment`, generate warnings. We'll likely want to fix these up if we're going to turn these warnings on.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ninit.cpp:969:5: warning: loop will run at most once (loop increment never executed) [-Wunreachable-code-loop-increment]\r\n     for (const auto& arg : gArgs.GetUnsuitableSectionOnlyArgs()) {\r\n     ^~~\r\n 1 warning generated.\r\n ```\r\n https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/aa8d76806c74a51ec66e5004394fe9ea8ff0fac4/src/init.cpp#L968-L972\r\n\r\nTo fix this, collect all errors, and output them in a single error message after the loop completes. This resolves the unreachable code warning, and avoids popup hell that could result from outputting a seperate message for each error or warning one by one.",

Feel free to tackle the warnings in a separate PR if you want :)\r\n\r\nThere's not really a rush to do this, and it's unlikely this will be merged while it introduces any new (presumably easy to fix?) warnings. So if we're going to turn new diagnostics on, let's just take care of any warnings now, or, if you'd rather not deal with code changes, please reduce the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\nI checked out this branch and started building.

Enabling this diagnostic allows us to find such cases and reason about which is which.\r\n\r\nSee concept ACKs for enabling this diagnostic in #19015.\r\n\r\nCurrent warnings in `master` that would need to be addressed when enabling this diagnostic:\r\n\r\n```\r\nindex/blockfilterindex.cpp:54:5: warning: unused member function 'DBHeightKey' [-Wunused-member-function]\r\nscript/bitcoinconsensus.cpp:50:9: warning: unused member function 'GetType' [-Wunused-member-function]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Useful skills:\r\n\r\nBasic understanding of C++. See #19015 for an example on how to enable a compiler diagnostic by editing `configure.ac`.\r\n\r\n#### Want to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
