    "body": "This is an implementation of #5982 (and based off @sipa's commit in #5307, which has been squashed into this commit).\n\nCurrently new blocks are announced via `inv` messages.  Since headers-first download was introduced in 0.10, blocks are not processed unless the headers for the block connect to known, valid headers, so peers receiving `inv` messages respond with a `getheaders` and a `getdata`: the expectation is that the announcing peer will send the headers for the block and any parents unknown to the peer before delivering the new block.\n\nIn the case of a reorg, nodes currently announce only the new tip, and not the blocks that lead to the tip.  This means that an extra round-trip is required to relay a reorg, because the peer receiving the `inv` for the tip must wait for the response to the `getheaders` message before being able to request the missing blocks.  (For additional reasons discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5307#issuecomment-93785348, it's not optimal to `inv` all the blocks added in the reorg to a headers-first peer, because this results in needless traffic due to the way `getheaders` requests are generated when direct-fetching `inv`'ed blocks.)\n\nThis pull implements a new `sendheaders` p2p message, which a node sends to its peers to indicate that the node prefers to receive new block announcements via a `headers` message rather than an inv.  This implementation does a few things:\n- When announcing a new block to a peer that prefers headers, try to announce all the blocks that are being added, back to the last fork point, by sending headers for each.\n- Avoid sending headers for blocks that are already known to the peer (determined by checking `pindexBestKnownBlock` and `pindexBestHeaderSent` and their ancestors).\n  - pindexBestKnownBlock is updated based on `inv` messages, `headers` sent from that peer, and `getheaders` messages sent from the peer.\n  - `pindexBestHeaderSent` is a new variable that tracks the best header we have sent to the peer\n- Avoid sending more than 8 headers to the peer.  This code is designed to be optimized for relaying at the tip, so a large reorg is some kind of error condition; in that case avoid spamming the peer with a lot of headers and instead fall back to the old `inv` mechanism.\n- If the headers to be announced aren't known to connect to headers that the peer has, then revert to sending an `inv` at the tip instead.  This is designed to avoid DoS points from sending headers that don't connect.  Since every new block should generally be announced by one peer in any pair of peers, it's expected that once headers-announcement begins on a link (ie once two nodes are known to be synced), it should be able to continue.\n- After #6148 is merged, this would allow pruning nodes to generally be able to relay reorgs to peers via headers announcements.  The code that implements direct fetching upon receipt of a headers message will send `getdata` requests to any peer that announces a block via a headers message.\n\nThis pull includes a new python p2p test exercising the new functionality.\n\nBIP 130 describes the proposed new `sendheaders` p2p message here:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki \n",

      "body": "@rebroad  Sorry, I just realized I should have emphasized more clearly that this PR also includes code to enable direct-fetching of blocks based on headers messages.  Without that change, nodes that received a headers message would otherwise wait to download blocks through the existing parallel fetch mechanism, which would generally make headers-announcement inferior to inv-announcements (because we have direct-fetch code in the inv-processing logic, which means we'd be quicker to request a new block).\n\nConsequently I think it makes sense for nodes to somehow opt-in to the new behavior.  0.10 and 0.11 nodes should continue to receive inv's even after this code is merged.\n\nOne thing that wasn't clear to me was whether it's really necessary to do the protocol version bump in order to deploy the new p2p message, given that the new message is backwards compatible -- nodes are free to ignore it.  However I'm not sure I have a good grasp of how the protocol versions should be thought about.\n",

      "body": "@sipa @gmaxwell My preference for not sending a new messages comes from an event-driven implementor's POV. If a remote nodes are allowed to switch preferences mid-stream, it can greatly (and needlessly) complicate the local node's sending logic.\n\nThe easy way to avoid that is to disallow changing the preference _back_ once set (this seems to be the case in @sdaftuar's BIP). Taking that a step further, it also makes sense to only accept the message early in the connection process, say directly after version/verack, and before any inv. And if that's the case, it may as well just be considered as part of the handshake.\n\nEssentially, I would much prefer to avoid making life-of-the-connection properties stateful unless necessary. Extending the version message makes sense to me, but I understand @sipa's objection there. \n\n@gmaxwell's suggestion seems reasonable, assuming that the \"flags\" message had the requirement of being sent directly after version/verack. Absence of the message would actively (though perhaps unknowingly) communicate the desire for default flags (historic behavior). Again, this just seems like an extension of the version message to me, but if changes there are deemed problematic, this would be my preference.\n",

He reported doing so made it\n consistently faster.\n\nI think it's reasonable to signal blocknotify first: All it does\n is fire off a new thread, so it should never block.\n\nThis does not move up GetMainSignals().UpdatedBlockTip() which\n because that signal includes the wallet, and if there is a\n wallet with many keys the wallet processing of a block can\n be quite slow.

Though I took out the code to parse the locator and update `pindexBestKnownBlock`, it turns out that if we generate no headers to return then we will end up setting `pindexBestHeaderSent` to equal `chainActive.Tip()`.  \n\nThis behavior was just due to a quirk in the code (the test that does that is checking to see if we've walked off the end of chainActive and assumes that if we're at a NULL pointer then we must have returned our tip to the peer), but I believe this is correct behavior.  I added a comment to the code explaining this quirk, but am leaving it in because I think it's correct and beneficial.\n\nOn a separate note: I was reminded when I looked at this again that if a peer sends us a getheaders with a locator that is caught up to our tip, then we'll send back an empty headers message.  Is it important that this behavior be preserved?  I left it unchanged for now, but I can clean this up and suppress an empty response if it's safe to do so, either in this pull or separately.\n",

However, in the case of a reorg, we may have some of the headers on the reorged-to-chain, which our peers will not re-announce to us -- meaning that the direct-fetch logic wouldn't request needed missing blocks immediately.\n\nI've restructured the direct fetch logic so that if we want to download towards the latest block a peer has announced to us, then we walk back from that tip and consider every block until we find one that is on our current chain.  (We try to download every block that we don't have that is not already in-flight, and we bail out if we're walking back too many blocks.)\n\nI also realized that `sendheaders.py` had no tests for the direct fetch logic, so I updated it to exercise that part of the code as well.\n",

Since the removal of the fixed sleeps in the network code, this resulted in fast and attackable (see #7123) treatment of such broadcasts.\n\nThis pull request changes each of these trickle-dependant mechanisms with a per-node and per-feature random delay timer, improving privacy and performance by making queueing useful again.\n\nThe commits are mostly squashed/rebased versions taken from #5989 by @pstratem, except:\n- No randomization of tx invs (more code changes, and may not interact well with transactions that need to be sent after their dependencies).\n- No removal of the \"1/4 blast to all\" behaviour, as #7123 proposes an alternative.\n- No removal of the \"announce yourself to outbound peers\" behaviour.\n",

Turns out there's an unusual feature in the getheaders handling, where we set `pindexBestHeaderSent` to `chainActive.Tip()` in two situations: if we actually are sending the tip, or if we have nothing to send.  I think the latter case can only happen if our peer has our tip in their locator, so I believe this behavior is desirable, if surprising.\n\nI've added a comment to the relevant line of code in main.cpp explaining this behavior.\n",
