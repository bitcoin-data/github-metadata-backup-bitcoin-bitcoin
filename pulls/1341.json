Waiting can end (and does in the code), but Already Asked for requires a past event that's happened to unhappen. This is confusing.\n\n2) Later code (which I am hoping gets pulled when finished, such as #1326) uses variables that make sense, and makes the code simpler to understand when used with this renamed mapping.\n\n3) probably other reasons....\n",
