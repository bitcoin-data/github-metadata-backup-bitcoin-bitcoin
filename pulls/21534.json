    "body": "The motivation of this PR is to extract and encapsulate logic in [SendMessages()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net_processing.cpp#L4164) into smaller and focused methods, also motivated by a brief comment during a review of [#21509](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21509#issuecomment-805808485).\r\n\r\nThis PR extracts the logic to maybe announce the nodes local address to a peer. \r\n\r\nIf there is sufficient support for this type of refactoring, then the intention would be that further changes should be made in separate PRs to extract each area of logic from `SendMessages()`. \r\n\r\nThe idea would be for the changes to eventually look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbool PeerManagerImpl::SendMessages(CNode* pto) {\r\n    ...\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(cs_main);\r\n        ...\r\n        MaybeAnnounceLocalAddress(...);\r\n        SendAddr(...);\r\n        SendGetHeadersBlockSync(...);\r\n        SendBlockAnnouncements(...);\r\n        SendInv(...);\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe argument for this change would be, that it would be easier to read and understand the high level logic of `SendMessages()`. There other reason would be to separate and encapsulate each area of logic according to narrow responsibilities.\r\n\r\nSince the logic in `SendMessages()` is important, I am concerned that moving the code around for style and readability may introduce unintended bugs, for example implementing safe and correct method signatures. I was also unable to find tests that specifically target announcing local addresses while in IBD or if the peer is `block-relay-only`. \r\n\r\nAny feedback would greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks for this @ccdle12. It goes without saying that I'm very supportive of such changes. `SendMessages()` is a monster. It's very difficult to know whether their are unintended interactions between the different parts of the code. It's also impossible to isolate and test the functionality for the units of code.\r\n\r\n> The idea would be for the changes to eventually look something like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> bool PeerManagerImpl::SendMessages(CNode* pto) {\r\n>     ...\r\n>     {\r\n>         LOCK(cs_main);\r\n>         ...\r\n>         MaybeAnnounceLocalAddress(...);\r\n>         SendAddr(...);\r\n>         SendGetHeadersBlockSync(...);\r\n>         SendBlockAnnouncements(...);\r\n>         SendInv(...);\r\n>         ...\r\n>     }\r\n>     ...\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nOr perhaps even better would be for each peer to have a list of tasks with times, and then pop tasks off the front when the current time has passed the task time. That'd stop us from making many redundant time comparisons in each `SendMessages()` invocation.\r\n\r\nI've already done something very similar to this PR in #21236. Do you mind taking a look at that and seeing if it achieves your goals?",
