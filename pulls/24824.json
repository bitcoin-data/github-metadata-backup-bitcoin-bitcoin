    "body": "### Per task number 1 in issue #17020 , \"Read ASNs from a file instead of hardcoding\"\r\nThe function 'lookup_asn' has been replaced in a drop in manner by a tab separated value (.tsv) file loader class and function set. This drop in bypasses the current REST based ASN implementation where a 3rd party is contacted per ip address to fetch the current ASN for that ip address. A REST approach is slower than the localized database search found in this PR. \r\n\r\n**Tech Details**\r\nThis drop in replacement utilizes a class object that upon construction loads an ASN database file into memory. This class should be instantiated in 'makeseeds.py'. Once the class has been constructed the makeseeds.py can call asn_lookup() to get the ASN of an ip address from the now localized database. This approach affords speed and decentralization at the cost of a marginal repository size increase.  As the old saying goes there is no such thing as a free lunch.  \r\n\r\nEdit: 4/11/2022\r\nThe class object has been reworked in such a manner that upon instantiation the class if the constructor is provided with a True value for 'fetch'. The class will acquire the compressed dataset upon runtime from the web address stored in the class object (_this could be passes as parameter theoretically_). This fetching process removes the need to store the ip to asn database as a blob in the repository. If fetch is set to False then the class object will attempt to load the default file. If neither a asn db file is present or a fetch is requested the failover mechanism kicks in an performs ip to asn decoding using the previous method currently in master. Failover is slower in all cases and seemly doesn't resolve ip addresses as frequently. \r\n\r\nDatasource: [https://iptoasn.com/](https://iptoasn.com/) Combined IPv4+IPv6 to ASN map\r\n\r\nError messages for failed ip lookups from the previous REST are identical. Additional asserts have been added to avoid feeding the ASN database loader invalid data.  These asserts should cover some of the most common issues.\r\n\r\n- IP has too many segments\r\n- File does not exist\r\n- Invalid number of columns (currently 5)\r\n- IP address has too many segments\r\n- Decimal/Hexdecimal range is invalid within a segment\r\n- ASN database has no records\r\n\r\n**Cost and Changes** \r\n2 files were added. 'ansdecode.py' which contains a class that loads a .tsv.gz file and has member functions that replace existing ASN lookups that are performed by parsing http://www.team-cymru.com/IP-ASN-mapping.html. The second file by default is ip2asn.tsv.gz. This filename is a class constructor parameter that can be changed if a user would like to use a custom file location. This ip2asn.tsv.gz is a compressed .tsv that has a format of [rangeStart rangeEnd asnNumber ...]\\n. Only the first 3 columns of the TSV are utilized additional columns can be included but will only make importing less efficient by doing so. \r\n\r\n**Advantages**\r\n\r\n- Faster: on an Intel Xeon 2699v4 Linux time was reduced from ~2:40 to ~1:50\r\n- Decreases dependance on 3rd party services - Changes to the ASN allocations are infrequent. \r\n- Auditable data format _Uncompressed_\r\n- Asserts on class load with the ample information to identify broken/corrupt lines in the input file\r\n- IPV4/6 Detection function is included and could be used to replace the need for manual definitions in makeseeds.py\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages**\r\n\r\n- Uncompressed ASN database unmodified is 26MB - https://iptoasn.com/ - Data is public domain.\r\n- Compressed ASN databased is ~7.8MB - https://iptoasn.com/ - Data is public domain.\r\n- ASN .tsv.gz database would need to be updated occasionally.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\n- ansdecode.py can be included into the makeseeds.py at the cost of additional file length\r\n- Deliberate use of a class to make testing and auditing of IP hex strings to integer possible.\r\n- The TSV file could be converted to a CSV easily\r\n- The TSV file could be downloaded at runtime instead of being included\r\n- At the cost of complexity one could implement a parallel threaded search for the applicable ip range\r\n- Internet based fallback and failover is possible though that would be quite extreme.

Your commits will need to be squashed before anything is merged in any case.\r\n\r\nAddressing the uncleanliness of this PR. Should this be PR remade? I can squash from here on out, I will learn from my mistakes but am still newish to git.\r\n\r\nThe larger issue to determine is if downloading a blob at runtime any better than parsing http://www.team-cymru.com/IP-ASN-mapping.html as makeseeds.py does right now? The other option would be to determine an acceptable database size for the ip to ASN database? I don't foresee anything smaller than 1MB with trimming and compression.\r\n\r\nThings to compress the ASN database would be to \r\n\r\n- Use a tree like structure where a node is an ASN and would connect to ranges it controls\r\n- Instead of writing the whole IP Address in the end range field, use the number of consecutive ip addresses owned in that block\r\n\r\n_Edit: Would a duality solution where the user could download an ASN file and if detected makeseeds would use it, If no ip->asn database file exists then the failover would be to parse http://www.team-cymru.com/IP-ASN-mapping.html as makeseeds is doing right now._\r\n\r\nThe issue as presented in #17020 suggests to not hardcode an ASN and then place it in a file in the same way as suspicious hosts are. The ASN directory is quite massive and doesn't follow any specific patterns due to the fact it's a registry of real world relations. Thus a hardcoded dataset with potentially billions of entries will require quite a bit of space.\r\n ",

Your commits will need to be squashed before anything is merged in any case.\r\n\r\nThere is now a mechanism in the class object to fetch the ip-asn directory database .gz file at runtime. The user can also load directly from a file they have created or obtained on their own if they wish without parsing an external source. A feature has been added is that if the asn db file is not loaded _or used_ the class fails over to a 1:1 clone of the current implementation to decode the ASN information that fetches though an api request.\r\n\r\nEdit: Working on fixing this PR -> some branch elements are not in sync with the master. \r\nCurrent master implementation - time\r\n![master](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3104223/162868213-ed49bcd1-b5cb-4cb6-9348-281bd893043b.jpg)\r\nASN in file database time\r\n![contrib](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3104223/162868364-3944b67c-349a-4cf5-971e-287bf5e2f01b.jpg)\r\n\r\nNote that the current implementation in this PR was able to resolve an IPv6 Address that was not resolvable via the current API service. If the ASN Database could not find a range for the current ip it would have failed over to the API call and the error in master would have been present in this branch.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: I could use some assistance fixing this branch. I have made some mistakes and I don't know how to walk them back.",

Does the filename reflect the modules usage?\r\n\r\n1. Should the load ASNs from file implementation be the default option instead of current REST lookup methods? Or should it be defaulted too with a REST based implementation as a failover is there is no file or a file could not be parsed? \r\n\r\n2. Should there be a defined format for an ASN file? Should the ASN file be compressed? CSV,TSV,JSON,XML?\r\n\r\n3. Since committing a 3MB+ blob to the core repo is not a good idea. Where should a file be hosted as a good default location to get on execution. \r\n\r\n4. What validation needs to happen in regards to the ip->asn lookup. There are a few moving parts such as fetch, failover, and parsing that would likely need validation.\r\n",

The commit has been backported to the GCC\nreleases/gcc-10 branch, but hasn't yet made it into a release.\n\nThe patch corrects a regression from an earlier GCC commit, see:\nhttps://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=357c4350680bf29f0c7a115424e3da11c53b5582\nand\nhttps://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=074226d5aa86cd3de517014acfe34c7f69a2ccc7,\nrelated to the way newer versions of mingw-w64 implement setjmp/longjmp.\n\nUltimately this was causing a crash for us when Windows users were\nviewing the network traffic tab inside the GUI. After some period, long\nenough that a buffer would need reallocating, a call into FreeTypes\ngray_record_cell() would result in a call to ft_longjmp (longjmp), which\nwould then trigger a crash.\n\nFixes: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/582.\n\nSee also:\nhttps://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=e8d1ca7d2c344a411779892616c423e157f4aea8.\nhttps://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-93476.\n\ndoc: Remove fee delta TODO from txmempool.cpp\n\nnet: remove non-blocking bool from interface\n\nlint: Convert lint-logs.sh to Python\n\ntest: determine path to `bitcoin-util` in test framework\n\nThe path is stored in `self.options.bitcoinutil`, points to\n`src/bitcoin-util` by default and can be overrided with the\n`BITCOINUTIL` environment variable.\n\ntest: add `is_bitcoin_util_compiled` helper\n\ntest: add test for signet miner script\n\ndepends: Add file-based logging for individual packages\n\nci: Make log verbose in error case only\n\nThis change silences depends build using LOG=1.\n\ndoc: Add pre-splitoff translation update to release-process.md",
