    "body": "This adds functional tests for the USDT tracepoints added in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22902. This partially fixes #23296. The tests **are probably skipped** on most systems as these tests require:\r\n- a Linux system with a kernel that supports BPF (and available kernel headers)\r\n- that Bitcoin Core is compiled with tracepoints for USDT support (default when compiled with depends)\r\n- [bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) installed\r\n- the tests are run with a privileged user that is able to e.g. do BPF syscalls and load BPF maps\r\n\r\nThe tests are not yet run in our CI as the CirrusCI containers lack the required permissions (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296#issuecomment-1024920845). Running the tests in a VM in the CI could work, but I haven't experimented with this yet. The priority was to get the actual tests done first to ensure the tracepoints work as intended for the v23.0 release. Running the tracepoint tests in the CI is planned as the next step to finish #23296.\r\n\r\nThe tests can, however, be run against e.g. release candidates by hand. Additionally, they provide a starting point for tests for future tracepoints. PRs adding new tracepoint should include tests. This makes reviewing these PRs easier.\r\n\r\nThe tests require privileges to execute BPF sycalls (`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` before Linux kernel 5.8 and `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON` on 5.8+) and permissions to `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/`. It's currently recommended to run the tests in a virtual machine (or on a VPS) where it's sensible to use the `root` user to gain these privileges. Never run python scripts you haven't carefully reviewed with `root` permissions! It's unclear if a non-root user can even gain the required privileges. This needs more experimenting.\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to test the tracepoint interface to make sure the [documented interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#tracepoint-documentation) does not break by accident. The tracepoints expose implementation details. This means we also need to rely on implementation details of Bitcoin Core in these functional tests to trigger the tracepoints. An example is the test of the `utxocache:flush` tracepoint: On Bitcoin Core shutdown, the UTXO cache is flushed twice. The corresponding tracepoint test expects two flushes, too - if not, the test fails. Changing implementation details could cause these tests to fail and the tracepoint API to break. However, we purposefully treat the tracepoints only as [**semi-stable**](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#semi-stable-api). The tracepoints should not block refactors or changes to other internals.\r\n",

          "body": "#22006 added the first three USDT based tracepoints to Bitcoin Core. To provide a [semi-stable](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#semi-stable-api) tracepoint API the tracepoints need test coverage. The tracepoints can be tested in the functional tests using the Python wrapper of [BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc). \r\n\r\nBefore adding more tracepoints, the existing three tracepoints from #22006 should be tested.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. We currently only support the tracepoints on Linux. The tests should be skipped on other operating systems.\r\n2. Hooking into the tracepoints via the Linux kernel requires special privileges. Since kernel version 5.8. (Aug. 2020) the `CAP_BPF` can be used. On older kernel version the overloaded catch-all capability `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is required. Functional tests shouldn't require `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` as that essentially means running the test suite with `root` privileges.  \r\n3. The tests require the BCC Python library. This should be an optional dependency. Tests should be skipped if the dependency isn't present. \r\n\r\nThe `connect_block` tracepoint can be tested by mining blocks with transactions and checking that the tracepoint passes the correct data. The `net` `inbound_message` and `outbound_message` tracepoints can be tested by checking the traffic between two nodes. \r\n",

The issue seems to be related to the printf in the unroll followed by another printf. \n\nThis is kinda off topic here, but there have been quite a few problems with `bpftrace` on different versions. People reported on IRC that the example scripts don't work with their `bpftrace` version. Have been thinking about dropping the examples until `bpftrace` is more stable. ",

After the first `CreateTransactionInternal` to observe the created transaction\r\n3. Prior to the second `CreateTransactionInternal` to notify that the optimistic avoid partial spends selection is occurring\r\n4. After the second `CreateTransactionInternal` to observe the created transaction and inform which solution is being used.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds an algorithm enum to `SelectionResult` so that the first tracepoint will be able to report which algorithm was used to produce that result.\r\n\r\nThe primary use case for these tracepoints is in running coin selection simulations. The script I use to run these simulations use these tracepoints in order to gather data on the algorithm used and the calculated waste.",

This meta issue should not be used to report bugs, as a single thread makes it impossible to track more than one topic.\r\n\r\n## What to test\r\n\r\nFor an idea what to test, see @stickies-v's [23.0 release candidate testing guide](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/23.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide), or\r\n\r\n- See [Draft Release Notes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/23.0-Release-Notes-draft) for a list of changes-\r\n- Also see testing reports for earlier releases ([v0.21.0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20555) [v22.0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22634))\r\n\r\n## Known issues (as of rc5)\r\n\r\nOther known issues:\r\n- MacOS: SHA256 acceleration is not enabled on MacOS 11.x due to missing reporting of sysctl `hw.optional.arm.*`.

This needs more experimenting.\r\n\r\nI managed to get the required privileges as a user, and get the tests to run (don't forget to patch `test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py` to remove the euid check):\r\n```\r\n# chmod 755 /sys/kernel/debug # might want to assign a special group or such\r\n# chmod 755 /sys/kernel/debug/tracing\r\n# chmod 666 /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/uprobe_events\r\n# echo \"3\" > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid # 3 or lower will do, 4 won't\r\n# setpriv --ambient-caps +cap_38,+cap_39 --inh-caps +cap_38,+cap_39 --init-groups --reuid=1000 --regid=1000 bash\r\n$ getpcaps $$\r\n310068: cap_perfmon,cap_bpf=eip\r\n$ cd …/bitcoin\r\n$ test/functional/interface_usdt_net.py\r\n(passes)\r\n$ test/functional/interface_usdt_validation.py\r\n(passes)\r\n$ test/functional/interface_usdt_utxocache.py\r\n(fails on some probably unrelated assertion)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's apparently also possible to assign fixed capabilities to users through `/etc/security/capability.conf`in some environments. I haven't tried this yet.\r\n\r\nBTW: `test_runner.py` fails on all the new tests for me. Although the test itself passes, warnings are printed to stderr, I think causing it to be marked as failed:\r\n```\r\nstderr:\r\nIn file included from <built-in>:2:                                                                       \r\nIn file included from /virtual/include/bcc/bpf.h:12:\r\nIn file included from include/linux/types.h:6:\r\nIn file included from include/uapi/linux/types.h:14:\r\nIn file included from include/uapi/linux/posix_types.h:5:\r\nIn file included from include/linux/stddef.h:5:\r\nIn file included from include/uapi/linux/stddef.h:2:\r\nIn file included from include/linux/compiler_types.h:80:\r\ninclude/linux/compiler-clang.h:41:9: warning: '__HAVE_BUILTIN_BSWAP32__' macro redefined [-Wmacro-redefine\r\nd]\r\n#define __HAVE_BUILTIN_BSWAP32__\r\n        ^\r\n<command line>:4:9: note: previous definition is here \r\n#define __HAVE_BUILTIN_BSWAP32__ 1\r\n        ^\r\n…\r\n```",

It might  be possible to get smarter with deduplication, but there are some  extra fields that prevent the obvious way.",

These tracepoints are active upon tx additions and evictions to the mempool. This is useful for logging the mempool contents for analysis. Better fee estimation models and custom TXID lookup scripts are some of the first uses that come to mind, \r\n\r\nThe included bpftrace script logs all mempool additions and removals in a .csv format that can be viewed in realtime or piped to a file for analysis. \r\n\r\n**NOTES** [Ref.](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md)\r\n - code included follows the USDT guidelines (no parsing or serialization) so near 0 effect on core performance. \r\n - bpftace script `log_mempool_activity.bt` is included and generates a .csv log output of all additions and evictions within the mempool along with the reason, size, time, txid, fee, and value of the TX\r\n - Documentation has been updated to reflect the new `mempool` context\r\n - Tracepoint API is very reliable in testing, _Logged mempool TXs for over 24 hours and the csv output was parsed with 0 errors._\r\n - No env vars change needed to run bpftrace script\r\n \r\n**IMPOVEMENTS** [Ref,](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/tracing#log_utxosbt)\r\n- The included bpftrace script improves on all existing examples by using a single `printf` call. This enables the script to log 100s of mempool evictions without dropping events and destroying the output. This means that unlike the current `log_utxos.bt` whos output is corrupted while using bpftrace default parameters. The include bpftrace script uses a variety of methods to improve performance and can be ran successfully with default bpftrace environment variables. \r\n",

This has low overhead and gives better analysis possibilities.\r\n\r\nWhen the script is attached with `sudo bpftrace contrib/tracing/lock_contention_analysis.bt`, you'll get a markdown formatted output that looks like this:\r\n\r\ntimestamp       | Lock                                  | waiting duration  | waiting at                     | blocked by\r\n---------------:|:--------------------------------------|------------------:|:-------------------------------|:------------------------------\r\n12:41:05.512089 | m_mutex                               |            4491µs | ./checkqueue.h          ( 175) | ./checkqueue.h          (  78)\r\n12:41:05.861322 | cs_main                               |          535058µs | net_processing.cpp      (1607) | validation.cpp          (2994)\r\n12:41:06.655427 | m_mutex                               |            4012µs | ./checkqueue.h          (  78) | ./checkqueue.h          (  78)\r\n12:41:06.675967 | cs_main                               |          650117µs | net_processing.cpp      (1607) | validation.cpp          (2994)\r\n12:41:06.894090 | m_mutex                               |            2747µs | ./checkqueue.h          (  78) | ./checkqueue.h          (  78)\r\n12:41:06.961872 | cs_main                               |          142277µs | net_processing.cpp      (1607) | validation.cpp          (2994)\r\n12:41:07.363535 | cs_main                               |          395851µs | net_processing.cpp      (1607) | validation.cpp          (2994)\r\n12:41:07.583226 | cs_main                               |           69281µs | net_processing.cpp      (1607) | validation.cpp          (2994)\r\n12:41:07.746665 | cs_main                               |          157604µs | net_processing.cpp      (1607) | validation.cpp          (2335)\r\n12:41:07.958787 | m_mutex                               |            3041µs | ./checkqueue.h          ( 175) | ./checkqueue.h          (  78)\r\n12:41:07.958801 | m_mutex                               |            2970µs | ./checkqueue.h          (  78) | ./checkqueue.h          ( 175)\r\n12:41:07.958842 | m_mutex                               |            2956µs | ./checkqueue.h          (  78) | ./checkqueue.h          ( 175)\r\n12:41:07.958853 | m_mutex                               |            2898µs | ./checkqueue.h          (  78) | ./checkqueue.h          (  78)\r\n12:41:07.958862 | m_mutex                               |            2820µs | ./checkqueue.h          (  78) | ./checkqueue.h          (  78)\r\n12:41:07.959201 | m_mutex                               |            3028µs | ./checkqueue.h          (  78) | ./checkqueue.h          (  78)\r\n12:41:07.959218 | m_mutex                               |            2916µs | ./checkqueue.h          (  78) | ./checkqueue.h          (  78)\r\n\r\nWhen monitoring is stopped (press Ctrl+C), the script prints the source locations where it has waited the longest while the script was running (unfortunately there seems to be no way to format this more nicely):\r\n\r\n```\r\nMonitored from 17:12:18.513400 to 17:42:08.565786. top 50 lock contention locations (file, lineNo): µs\r\n[...]\r\n@locked_at_source_line[./net.h, 1233]: 334654\r\n@locked_at_source_line[txmempool.cpp, 823]: 401472\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 4504]: 661670\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 4872]: 668911\r\n@locked_at_source_line[txmempool.cpp, 1096]: 681892\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 4857]: 825963\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 4724]: 826719\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 4677]: 827335\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 4154]: 827972\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 4222]: 828863\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net.cpp, 2329]: 831334\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 4217]: 831451\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 4231]: 839408\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 4198]: 846353\r\n@locked_at_source_line[util/system.cpp, 1035]: 883117\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net.cpp, 1426]: 1398949\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net.cpp, 1422]: 1416004\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net.cpp, 1611]: 1564984\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 4205]: 1668173\r\n@locked_at_source_line[net_processing.cpp, 1334]: 1704239\r\n@locked_at_source_line[validation.cpp, 5173]: 2899013\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this to work I had to add traces to `UniqueLock` and `AnnotatedMixin`, and move the implementation into the cpp file (without moving, due to inlining the maximum number of traces of 512 is quickly exhausted)",

          "body": "Changes a CI task that runs test the previously not run `test/functional/interface_usdt_*.py` functional tests (added in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24358). \r\n\r\nThis task is run as CirussCI `compute_engine_instance` VM as hooking into the tracepoints is not possible in CirrusCI docker containers (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296#issuecomment-1024920845). We use an unoffical PPA and untrusted  `bpfcc-tools` package in the CI as the Ubuntu jammy and Debian bullseye packages are outdated. We hope use an official package when new Ubuntu/Debian releases are available for the use with Google Compute Engine.\r\n\r\nWe make sure to hook into `bitcoind` binaries in USDT interface tests via their PID, instead of their path. This makes sure multiple functional tests running in parallel don't interfere with each other.\r\n\r\nThe utxocache USDT interface tests is adopted to a change of the functional test framework that wasn't detected as the tests weren't run in the CI. As the tracepoints expose internals, it can happen that we need to adopt the interface test when internals change. This is a bit awkward, and if it happens to frequently, we should consider generalizing the tests a bit more. For now it's fine, I think.\r\n\r\nSee the individual commit messages for more details on the changes.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24782\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear from reviewers:\r\n- Are we OK with using the [`hadret/bpfcc`](https://launchpad.net/~hadret/+archive/ubuntu/bpfcc) PPA for now? There is a clear plan when to drop it and as is currently, it could only impact the newly added VM task. \r\n- ~~Adding a new task increases CI runtime and costs. Should an existing `container` CI task be ported to a VM and reused instead?~~ Yes, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25528#issuecomment-1179509525 ",
