In `PrioritiseTransaction` we call `FormatMoney(nFeeDelta)` on fee deltas. Fee deltas are allowed to be outside of the normal `MoneyRange(…)` as pointed out by luke-jr in another PR.\r\n\r\nAFAICT we don't put a lower or upper bound on fee deltas (besides being `CAmount` of course), so I thought it was safest to define `FormatMoney` and `ValueFromAmount` for the entire `CAmount` including the `std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::min()` corner case :)\r\n\r\nSome additional context: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20383#discussion_r523250890 :)",

The additional \"verbosity level 3\" features are planned for a future PR.\r\n\r\n**Original PR description:**\r\n\r\n> Using block undo data (like in #14802) we can now show fee information for each transaction in a block without the need for additional -txindex and/or a ton of costly lookups. For a start we'll add transaction fee information to getblock verbosity level 2. This comes at a negligible speed penalty (<1%).",

          "body": "This tiny PR replaces all remaining occurences of manual conversion of Satoshi amounts (`CAmount`) to a currency unit string via division and modulo operation on `COIN` (100000000) by the utility function `FormatMoney(...)`. The instances were found with the command\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit grep \"\\%[ ]*COIN\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly `ToString()`-functions are affected, but still I'd argue that the constants `COIN` should only be used:\r\n* for money constants (like in benchmark/tests, chainparams, `GetBlockSubsidy(...)` etc.) and\r\n* for utility functions that need it (like `{Parse,Format}Money`, `ValueFromAmount` etc.)\r\n\r\nNote that strictly speaking, this is not a pure refactor, as the function `FormatMoney(...)` drops excess zero after two decimal places.",
