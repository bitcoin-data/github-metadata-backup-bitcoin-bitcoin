I've subsequently gone around and caused several parties (like electrum) to update their behavior.\n\nThis could also be coupled with a change that automatically 'fixes' failing transactions by mutating them instead of causing them to be be rejected completely (I understand code for this already exists, but isn't public)-- a prospect which is much less unappealing now that malleability attacks are already going on. However, if LowS becomes even more widespread quickly this change alone may be enough.\n\nIf anyone wants to do some sleuthing on which software is still producing HighS signatures, here is a list of addresses recently (but before the recent spate of attacks) involved in a HighS signature: https://people.xiph.org/~greg/high-s-reusecnt.log ...\n",

          "body": "It'd be useful to have a chapter that discusses the changes in pubkey and signature encoding. I think they belong in the same chapter because they're both the same concept: trimming the fat so the minimal required data is stored on the blockchain/UTXO set.\r\n\r\n- pubkeys were originally uncompressed, changed to compressed in v0.6: https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.6.0 [65 -> 33 bytes per pubkey]\r\n- signature encoding:\r\n    - Originally, Bitcoin accepted any ASN.1 BER encoded signature. The maximum length for those signatures was platform-dependent (https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009697.html)\r\n    - BIP 66 caused Bitcoin to enforce strict DER signatures, which limited the signature size to a maximum of 73 bytes (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki)\r\n    - Bitcoin Core has produced 'low S' signatures since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3016, reducing maximum signature size to 72 bytes (7 bytes overhead, 32 bytes for S, 33 bytes for R). High S signatures were made non-standard in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6769.\r\n    - Bitcoin Core has produced 'low R' signatures since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13666, reducing maximum signature size to 71 bytes (7 bytes overhead, 32 bytes for S, 33 bytes for R).\r\n    - the Schnorr signature proposal at https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki encodes the R point and s value without DER padding, fixing all signatures size to 64 bytes.\r\n\r\nGood references for DER encoding:\r\n- https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/77192/26940\r\n- code comment at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki#der-encoding-reference",
