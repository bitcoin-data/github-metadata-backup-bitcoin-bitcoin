    "body": "So far, discouragement of peers triggers when their misbehavior score exceeds 100 points. Most types of misbehavior increment the score by 100, triggering immediate discouragement, but some types do not. This PR makes all increments equal to either 100 (meaning any misbehavior will immediately cause disconnection and discouragement) or 0 (making the behavior effectively unconditionally allowed), and then removes the logic for score accumulation.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies the code a bit, but also makes protocol expectations clearer: if a peer misbehaves, they get disconnected. There is no good reason why certain types of protocol violations should be permitted 4 times (howmuch=20) or 9 times (howmuch=10), while many others are never allowed. Furthermore, the distinction between these looks arbitrary.\r\n\r\nTo assess whether this does not unduly affect existing other software on the network, I've been running this with an additional patch (see https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/202403_nomisbehave_log) that adds logging whenever behavior is detected whose misbehavior increment is changed to 100 by this PR. Over the past day I have not seen any instances on my well-connected node (~150 incoming connections), but will continue to monitor.\r\n\r\nThe specific types of misbehavior that are changed to 100 are:\r\n* Sending us a `block` which does not connect to our header tree (which necessarily must have been unsollicited). [used to be score 10]\r\n* Sending us a `headers` with a non-continuous headers sequence. [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 1000 addresses in a single `addr` or `addrv2` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 50000 invs in a single `inv` message [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 2000 headers in a single `headers` message [used to be score 20]\r\n\r\nThe specific types of misbehavior that are changed to 0 are:\r\n* Sending us 10 (*) separate BIP130 headers announcements that do not connect to our block tree [used to be score 20]\r\n* Sending us more than 8 headers in a single `headers` message (which thus does not get treated as a BIP130 announcement) that does not connect to our block tree. [used to be score 10]\r\n\r\nI believe that none of these behaviors are unavoidable, except for the one marked (*) which can in theory happen still due to interaction between BIP130 and variations in system clocks (the max 2 hour in the future rule). This one has been removed entirely. In order to remove the impact of the bug it was designed to deal with, without relying on misbehavior, a separate improvement is included that makes `getheaders`-tracking more accurate.\r\n\r\nIn another unrelated improvement, this also gets rid of the 8 header limit heuristic to determine whether an incoming non-connecting `headers` is a potential BIP130 announcement, as this rule is no longer needed to prevent spurious Misbehavior. Instead, any non-connecting `headers` is now treated as a potential announcement.",

Being able to check that the `misbehavior_score` of a peer has increased as expected seems a better approach.\r\n\r\nFrom an end-user perspective, being able to check whether a peer has been misbehaving also seems useful.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

I agree with that sentiment and think it would be beneficial to make this explicit by renaming the inherited function.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for `ConstructBlockHash()`.",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNext step after this PR is done will be to have the wallet do the private broadcast as well, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11887 would have to be resolved.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

          "body": "This adds five new tracepoints with documentation and tests for network connections:\r\n\r\n- established connections with `net:inbound_connection` and `net:outbound_connection`\r\n- closed connections (both closed by us or by the peer) with `net:closed_connnection`\r\n- inbound connections that we choose to evict with `net:evicted_inbound_connection`\r\n- connections that are misbehaving and punished with `net:misbehaving_connection`\r\n\r\nI've been using these tracepoints for a few months now to monitor connection lifetimes, re-connection frequency by IP and netgroup, misbehavior, peer discouragement, and eviction and more. Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, score_before=0, score_increase=20, message='getdata message size = 50001', threshold_exceeded=false\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",

It seems cheap enough to process slightly-too-far-in-the-future headers, and they are enormously expensive to produce.\r\n\r\n(for other reviewers, look for `MAX_NUM_UNCONNECTING_HEADERS_MSGS` to see where this is handled)\r\n\r\nThe peer might also be telling us about a reorg longer than `MAX_BLOCKS_TO_ANNOUNCE = 8`.

If we were to immedidately disconnect (`MAX_NUM_UNCONNECTING_HEADERS_MSGS = 1` then step 5 of `p2p_sendheaders.py` fails). This doesn't account for the time difference issue. And in any case it can be done in a followup. And of course we wouldn't need an integer, but could instead call it `m_chicken_little`.",

If any of the headers are `> MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME * 10` in the future we disconnect with `time-too-new`. We could perhaps increase the number to allow for even more incorrect clocks, but I'm not sure how useful that is.\r\n\r\nSome of the comments in that commit may be spurious; I can't think of a useful attack where a peer (e.g. Bob) sends us headers, three hours in the future, with fake PoW. All Bob would achieve is that we ask ~another peer (Caroll)~ Bob for the missing headers, which ~Caroll either won't have, or she does we disconnect her~ he either sends, for which we disconnect. Or he doesn't send and tries again, at which point we disconnect him.\r\n\r\nI also don't know if if it's even worth checking if a header is in the far future, but at least it makes for more useful log entries? (it's nice to know the difference between a peer with a broken clock and a peer that falsely announces a large reorg)",

      "body": "I discussed this with @sdaftuar, @mzumsande, @sr-gi in person, and decided to instead just drop the Misbehavior score for unconnecting headers. The rationale is that this misbehavior was originally intended to prevent bandwidth wastage due to very broken (but likely non-malicious) nodes actually observed on the network that respond to GETHEADERS with a response unrelated to the request, triggering a request cycle. This has however largely been addressed by #25454, which limits the number of (not responded to) GETHEADERS requests in flight to one, with a 2 minute timeout. With that, the specific misbehavior is largely irrelevant (for inbound peers, it is now mostly harmless; for outbound peers, the eviction logic will eventually kick them out if they're not keeping up with headers at all).",

This means that peers that keep sending us useless headers, will probably not enjoy this protection and eventually get replaced. Unless they _also_ give use useful data, in which case they're ... useful - and we can just humor their headers shenaningans.\r\n\r\n> ...  for outbound peers, the eviction logic will eventually kick them out if they're not keeping up with headers at all).\r\n\r\nIIUC outbound peer eviction is handled in `PeerManagerImpl::ConsiderEviction`, which loses its patience after `CHAIN_SYNC_TIMEOUT + HEADERS_RESPONSE_TIME`. That seems a bit late though, if all our outbound peers are slow? Even if that's rare, it seems better to have as many \"fit\" outbound peers as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso... It might still be useful, even if not needed for security, to _know_ if a peer sent us disconnecting headers. Although the `NET` log still provides a log message `received header %s: missing prev block %s, sending getheaders (%d) to end (peer=%d)`, we don't know the outcome.\r\n\r\nTracking if the peer did this before, e.g. with something like `m_chicken_little`, would make this easier. But not sure if it's worth the complexity. It seems all this would do is reveal that someone tried an attack that we believe to be useless.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@Sjors It's worth taking into account that despite its history as originally being a \"DoS score\", the discouragement logic isn't particularly good at preventing *intentional* abuse of resources; scoring systems are inherently easy to bypass: just do enough to keep the score acceptable, and be as wasteful otherwise (or even better, if many IP addresses are available, use several). The only real solution, in my opinion, for actual DoS protection is keeping track of how many resources (bandwidth, CPU, I/O, ...) we spend on behalf of every peer, and whenever those resources become a bottleneck for us, throttle the worst peers.\r\n\r\nSo the purpose for the discouragement logic as I see it is avoiding wasting resources on (unintentionally) *broken* peers. These are somewhat distinct from *useless* peers (which is what the outbound eviction logic is aimed to prevent). There is an infinite amount of potential broken behavior one can imagine, and clearly we cannot have code for all of it. \r\n\r\nAnother reason for the misbehavior detection is to help protocol implementers get a good idea for expectations around parts of the protocol that aren't formally specified (because it triggers disconnections, and possibly logging). And arguably, unconnecting headers isn't a protocol violation, at least in the context of BIP130 announcements, so disconnecting for something that's very rare but not impossible to trigger in what we'd consider a perfectly compliant protocol implementation would be confusing.",

I left some comments inline, plus some general ones that may be addressable with the change of functionality:\r\n\r\n- Looks like `banmah.h` also needs updating, given there is no such thing as how much a peer misbehaves anymore:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  (line 37) // 2. Discouragement. If a peer misbehaves enough (see Misbehaving() in\r\n  // net_processing.cpp)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- `p2p_filter.py` and `p2p_invalid_messages.py` are asserting logs looking for `Misbehaving`. Shouldn't it be better now to just check that the peer was disconnected in those cases? e.g:\r\n\r\n  ```python\r\n  self.log.info('Check that too large filter is rejected')\r\n  with self.nodes[0].assert_debug_log(['Misbehaving']):\r\n      filter_peer.send_and_ping(msg_filterload(data=b'\\xbb'*(MAX_BLOOM_FILTER_SIZE+1)))\r\n  ```",

I've instead added that as a separate improvement, becoming the new first commit.\r\n\r\n@sr-gi I have not addressed the `p2p_filter.py` and `p2p_invalid_messages.py` using misbehavior logging. These tests use whitelisting to prevent disconnection, and I think reworking that isn't necessarily an improvement.",

This implied that, if a test needed to check for a specific block hash within a headers message, it had to make sure that it was checking the desired message. This normally involved having to manually clear `last_message`. This method, apart from being too verbose, was error-prone, given an undesired `getheaders` would make tests pass.\r\n\r\nThis adds the ability to check for a specific block_hash within the last `getheaders` message.\r\n\r\n",

For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs.

This is to prevent using `m_k0` for something it is not intended to, given what data we feed to the randomizer should not matter\r\n- `destinations/target` has been renamed to `n` in `ShouldFanoutTo/IsFanoutTarget` \r\n- The PR has been rebased \r\n\r\nAlso, the following things have been added/changed to the approach:\r\n- Deal with short id collisions by fanning out both transactions\r\n- Deal with ancestors being present on the mempool when a children needs to be placed in the fanout or reconciliation sets (as opposed to deal with parents, which was the wrong approach)\r\n- Move fanout/reconcile logic from from INV creation to `RelayTransaction`\r\n\r\nThe differences can be easily checked via `git range-diff a14dfd9c873d1e196252c77ad7a8b32bd21b6f6d...ac5dc0aa512e78a1cc90e0ab182eedaec68b0444`\r\n\r\nErlay Project Tracking: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28646",

But if our peer is broken in a way that they ignore the contents of our locator and send us unconnecting headers again, we clear `m_last_getheaders_timestamp`, call `ProcessHeadersMessage` and immediately send a `GetHeaders` again (we wold only delay that if `m_last_getheaders_timestamp` hadn't been cleared)  - and after this PR we wouldn't discourage the peer anymore so that this could go on forever. How did #25454 address that?",
