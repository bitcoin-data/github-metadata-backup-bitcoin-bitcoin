    "body": "The class `CTxOut` has a member `CAmount` which is an int64_t, and on ARM 32bit int64_t are 8 byte aligned, which is larger than the pointer alignment of 4 bytes.\r\n\r\nSo for `CCoinsMap` to be able to use the pool, we need to use the alignment of the member instead of just `alignof(void*)`.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #28906 (first noted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28718#issuecomment-1807197107) and #28440\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

      "body": "ACK 486c2916a18b56d6011117077d906c1f8a81623f, tested on ARM 32-bit (ODROID-HC1 + Armbian 23.8.3 jammy) both native and Guix binaries.\r\n\r\nThe first commit should not introduce any behaviour change in any other [release](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) platforms as they are 64-bit and it is holds that `alignof(T) == alignof(void*) == 8` for all of them.\r\n\r\nI agree with the second commit diff. It indeed handles the case where \"int64_t is aligned to 8 bytes but void* is aligned to 4 bytes\". But, due do its design flaw, the test still not failing in such a case, i.e., on ARM 32-bit, if the first commit were reverted. I believe that the reason of that is the test does not cover cases where `IsFreeListUsable` returns `false` only due to the `alignment <= ELEM_ALIGN_BYTES` condition fails while the `bytes <= MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES` condition still holds. It can be improved in a follow up.\r\n\r\nnit: The 486c2916a18b56d6011117077d906c1f8a81623f commit message has a stray substring in the end.\r\n\r\nSuggesting for backporting to the 26.x branch. EDIT: nm, already tagged :)",
