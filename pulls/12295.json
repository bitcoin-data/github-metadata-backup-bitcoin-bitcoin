      "body": "@jnewbery For the `flake8` violations we currently have in the code base I'd say that fixing and enabling Travis checking for `F841` (PR #12284: `local variable 'foo' is assigned to but never used`) and `F812` (this PR #12295: `list comprehension redefines 'foo' from line N `) would be enough.\r\n\r\nIf we want to go beyond that I'd suggest that we consider enabling the checks that we currently **do not** violate in our code base. Enabling them would guarantee that we will never introduce any new classes of violations in the future. FWIW, the following `flake8` command does not emit any warnings on `master`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git checkout master\r\n$ git pull upstream master\r\n$ flake8 --ignore=B,C,E,F,I,N,W --select=F402,F404,F406,F407,F601,F602,F621,F622,F631,\\\r\n    F701,F702,F703,F704,F705,F706,F707,F811,F822,F823,F831,E112,E113,E115,E116,E125,\\\r\n    E131,E133,E223,E224,E271,E272,E273,E274,E275,E304,E306,E502,E702,E703,\\\r\n    E714,E721,E741,E742,E743,W292,W504,W601,W602,W603,W604,W605 .\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese refer to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nF402 import module from line N shadowed by loop variable\r\nF404 future import(s) name after other statements\r\nF406 ‘from module import *’ only allowed at module level\r\nF407 an undefined __future__ feature name was imported\r\nF601 dictionary key name repeated with different values\r\nF602 dictionary key variable name repeated with different values\r\nF621 too many expressions in an assignment with star-unpacking\r\nF622 two or more starred expressions in an assignment (a, *b, *c = d)\r\nF631 assertion test is a tuple, which are always True\r\nF701 a break statement outside of a while or for loop\r\nF702 a continue statement outside of a while or for loop\r\nF703 a continue statement in a finally block in a loop\r\nF704 a yield or yield from statement outside of a function\r\nF705 a return statement with arguments inside a generator\r\nF706 a return statement outside of a function/method\r\nF707 an except: block as not the last exception handler\r\nF811 redefinition of unused name from line N\r\nF822 undefined name name in __all__\r\nF823 local variable name … referenced before assignment\r\nF831 duplicate argument name in function definition\r\nE112 expected an indented block\r\nE113 unexpected indentation\r\nE115 expected an indented block (comment)\r\nE116 unexpected indentation (comment)\r\nE125 continuation line with same indent as next logical line\r\nE131 continuation line unaligned for hanging indent\r\nE133 closing bracket is missing indentation\r\nE223 tab before operator\r\nE224 tab after operator\r\nE271 multiple spaces after keyword\r\nE272 multiple spaces before keyword\r\nE273 tab after keyword\r\nE274 tab before keyword\r\nE275 missing whitespace after keyword\r\nE304 blank lines found after function decorator\r\nE306 expected 1 blank line before a nested definition\r\nE502 the backslash is redundant between brackets\r\nE702 multiple statements on one line (semicolon)\r\nE703 statement ends with a semicolon\r\nE714 test for object identity should be ‘is not’\r\nE721 do not compare types, use ‘isinstance()’\r\nE741 do not use variables named ‘l’, ‘O’, or ‘I’\r\nE742 do not define classes named ‘l’, ‘O’, or ‘I’\r\nE743 do not define functions named ‘l’, ‘O’, or ‘I’\r\nW292 no newline at end of file\r\nW504 line break after binary operator\r\nW601 .has_key() is deprecated, use ‘in’\r\nW602 deprecated form of raising exception\r\nW603 ‘<>’ is deprecated, use ‘!=’\r\nW604 backticks are deprecated, use ‘repr()’\r\nW605 invalid escape sequence ‘x’\r\n```",
