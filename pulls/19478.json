    "body": "Currently we have a peculiar data structure in the mempool called maplinks. Maplinks job is to track the in-pool children and parents of each transaction. This PR can be primarily understood and reviewed as a simple refactoring to remove this extra data structure, although it comes with a nice memory and performance improvement for free.\r\n\r\nMaplinks is particularly peculiar because removing it is not as simple as just moving it's inner structure to the owning CTxMempoolEntry. Because TxLinks (the class storing the setEntries for parents and children) store txiters to each entry in the mempool corresponding to the parent or child, it means that the TxLinks type is \"aware\" of the boost multiindex (mapTx) it's coming from, which is in turn, aware of the entry type stored in mapTx. Thus we used maplinks to store this entry associated data we in an entirely separate data structure just to avoid a circular type reference caused by storing a txiter inside a CTxMempoolEntry.\r\n\r\nIt turns out, we can kill this circular reference by making use of iterator_to multiindex function and std::reference_wrapper. This allows us to get rid of the maplinks data structure and move the ownership of the parents/child sets to the entries themselves.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this good all around, for any of the reasons given below the change would be acceptable, and it doesn't make the code harder to reason about or worse in any respect (as far as I can tell, there's no tradeoff).\r\n\r\n### Simpler ownership model \r\nNo longer having to consistency check that mapLinks did have records for our CTxMempoolEntry, impossible to have a mapLinks entry outlive or incorrectly die before a CTxMempoolEntry.\r\n\r\n### Memory Usage\r\nWe get rid of a O(Transactions) sized map in the mempool, which is a long lived data structure. \r\n\r\n### Performance\r\nIf you have a CTxMemPoolEntry, you immediately know the address of it's children/parents, rather than having to do a O(log(Transactions)) lookup via maplinks (which we do very often). We do it in *so many* places that a true benchmark has to look at a full running node, but it is easy enough to show an improvement in this case.\r\n\r\nThe ComplexMemPool shows a good coherence check that we see the expected result of it being 12.5% faster / 1.14x faster.\r\n```\r\nBefore:\r\n# Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median\r\nComplexMemPool, 5, 1, 1.40462, 0.277222, 0.285339, 0.279793\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n# Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median\r\nComplexMemPool, 5, 1, 1.22586, 0.243831, 0.247076, 0.244596\r\n```\r\nThe ComplexMemPool benchmark only checks doing addUnchecked and TrimToSize for 800 transactions. While this bench does a good job of hammering the relevant types of function, it doesn't test everything. \r\n\r\nSubbing in 5000 transactions shows a that the advantage isn't completely wiped out by other asymptotic factors (this isn't the only bottleneck in growing the mempool), but it's only a bit proportionally slower (10.8%, 1.12x), which adds evidence that this will be a good change for performance minded users.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median\r\nComplexMemPool, 5, 1, 59.1321, 11.5919, 12.235, 11.7068\r\n\r\n# Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median\r\nComplexMemPool, 5, 1, 52.1307, 10.2641, 10.5206, 10.4306\r\n```\r\nI don't think it's possible to come up with an example of where a maplinks based design would have better performance, but it's something for reviewers to consider.\r\n\r\n# Discussion\r\n## Why maplinks in the first place?\r\n\r\nI spoke with the author of mapLinks (sdaftuar) a while back, and my recollection from our conversation was that it was implemented because he did not know how to resolve the circular dependency at the time, and there was no other reason for making it a separate map.\r\n\r\n## Is iterator_to weird?\r\n\r\niterator_to is expressly for this purpose, see https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/indices.html#iterator_to \r\n\r\n>  iterator_to provides a way to retrieve an iterator to an element from a pointer to the element, thus making iterators and pointers interchangeable for the purposes of element pointing (not so for traversal) in many situations. This notwithstanding, it is not the aim of iterator_to to promote the usage of pointers as substitutes for real iterators: the latter are specifically designed for handling the elements of a container, and not only benefit from the iterator orientation of container interfaces, but are also capable of exposing many more programming bugs than raw pointers, both at compile and run time. iterator_to is thus meant to be used in scenarios where access via iterators is not suitable or desireable:\r\n> \r\n>     - Interoperability with preexisting APIs based on pointers or references.\r\n>     - Publication of pointer-based interfaces (for instance, when designing a C-compatible library).\r\n>     - The exposure of pointers in place of iterators can act as a type erasure barrier effectively decoupling the user of the code from the implementation detail of which particular container is being used. Similar techniques, like the famous Pimpl idiom, are used in large projects to reduce dependencies and build times.\r\n>     - Self-referencing contexts where an element acts upon its owner container and no iterator to itself is available.\r\n\r\nIn other words, iterator_to is the perfect tool for the job by the last reason given. Under the hood it should just be a simple pointer cast and have no major runtime overhead (depending on if the function call is inlined).\r\n\r\nEdit by laanwj: removed at sign from the description",

I don't know if that's a good assumption though. the overhead for a map entry is very high. I would guess that it's somewhere around 64 bytes per entry? Can double check, but based on:\r\n```\r\n struct stl_tree_node\r\n {\r\n private:\r\n     int color;\r\n     void* parent;\r\n     void* left;\r\n     void* right;\r\n     std::pair<txiter, txlinks>;\r\n };\r\n```\r\nThat's 4 bytes + 4 bytes alignment + 8 * 3 bytes pointers + 8 bytes txiter (ignoring txlinks itself since we still store those in the CTxMempoolEntry, but adding another 8 bytes for alignments and padding) = 6 * 8 = 48 byes of raw overhead. Then with mallocusage, this gives us 64 bytes. So it may not *use* 64 bytes per element, but we certainly count that many! Depending on how big txlinks is itself, we may have some extra overhead (implementation dependent).\r\n\r\nAnyways, let's assume 64 bytes.\r\n\r\n\r\n64*50,000 bytes = 3.2 MB, 64 * 200,000 bytes = 12.8 MB.\r\n\r\nFor a 300MB pool, 1-3% memory savings. Note that this doesn't account for the fact that there are other downsides to the memory fragmentation of doing so many allocations, but a pooled allocator could also help with this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(A further change which is maybe worth looking at is the Children themselves -- because there is so much memory overhead, storing a std::vector<hash> and std::vector<element> might be more efficient for many txs with small numbers of vins/vouts, especially since you can super optimize checking if a H is in a vector v.s. log N random memory compares)\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@jonatack thanks for the review! Cool to see it making an even bigger impact on other people's systems -- can you share your hardware specs? Mine were run on AMD Ryzen 7 1800X Eight-Core, 3.6ghz, 32 gb ram 2133 MT/s. It generally makes sense that if you're on lesser hardware (more total time on your benches) there may be some other factors contributing to a bigger speedup.\r\n\r\nW.r.t. boost features, iterator_to is a member function of multiindex, so it's not a new feature it's an existing API. In any case, it has been in use in the mempool since 2015 on line 174 60de0d5826f1b848a43ec989ff712f002eddc3dc, so it should be fine.\r\n\r\nAll nits have been addressed.\r\n\r\n",

I think because it's all non-functional style related or documentary concerns it would be OK to do post-merge as there's a lot of other pending work that will touch/redo these areas eventually in any case.\r\n\r\nas to why it is 2 commits and not one, it used to be more commits, and then I slimmed it down. It previously made more sense as the prior patches were something like: 1) Introduce new API 2) Use New API 3) Delete old API, but 1 + 2 got squashed by request since there were a couple issues with the API changing the underlying return type making patch 1+2 fail to compile (even though readable). I don't care strongly, but have a mild preference for not burning out the extant reviewers.",

I'm not making a separate docs only fixup.\r\n\r\nSo for the most part the style changes and docs changes are already going to have to be re-reviewed when those follow on changes land.\r\n\r\nOriginally I intended not to update much documentation along the way (except where critical) because the mempool documentation is already very stale, but to honor some requests to improve it incrementally I added more stuff here. This points to why \"just fixing up the docs\" isn't really an option, they're so stale that any effort to improve them is inevitably going to bikeshed more because they're unclear and people want something easier to read.

Just noting that the prior name -- setMemPoolChildren -- was wrong (no such member existed) for like 5 years and no one fixed it (and even more wrong -- there was no field anywhere), so I sort of doubt anyone is actually reading the docs to learn how the code works anyways.\r\n\r\nIt needs a decent amount of rebasing and extracting specific chunks but I'm picking out patches from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17268 and https://github.com/JeremyRubin/bitcoin/pull/5. As I do that, a lot of the function signatures will change which is a good time to update the docs to be more coherent.",

The mutating ones are only called twice, whereas the read-only getters are called more often, so this would reduce verbosity. Also, safe languages (like rust) treat the default const and otherwise require mutable to be specified.\r\n```suggestion\r\n    Children& GetMemPoolChildrenMut() const { return m_children; }\r\n```",
