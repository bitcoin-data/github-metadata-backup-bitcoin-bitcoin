    "body": "Continuation of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2805.\n\nChanges since Round 2:\n\nRebased on current master\nBig cleanups\nAdded protoc/libprotobuf support\nAdded win32 installer make target\nAdded Gitian descriptors\n\nI could use some help with the following items:\n- Documenting windows/osx/mingw build. They should all be working, but I don't currently have a windows/osx environment for testing. Documentation is a rather large job for this merge, as it requires a pretty extensive overhaul. For the most part, the build docs can be thrown away and replaced by a single procedure, with the exception of platform-specific dependencies setup. There is no longer any need for a distinction between gui/non-gui build procedures.\n- Edit: Gitian issues fixed.\n\nI've briefly updated the documentation for unix. Sadly, my macbook busted last weekend (should be fixed in ~1wk), So I was not able to add the osx dmg build target as I had intended, nor the documentation for building on osx.\n\nIs anyone willing to help me out with the above?\n## \n\nHere is the final go at an Autotools build system replacement. It is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the current system(s), providing the same features with no net changes. It can also live side-by-side with the old system while sharing the same build-related variables in order to facilitate a smooth transition.\n\nI hope the benefits are obvious enough: A single/shared build procedure, portability, ease of packaging, ease for downstreams, ease for repository maintainers, cross-compilation, etc. I don't vouch for Autotools in any way, in fact, this configure.am is downright ugly (mainly just because of mingw though), but it's portable and well-established.\n\nThis does away with the need for qmake, as the Makefile is capable of generating everything it needs in a portable way.\n\nBuilding from CLI:\nFor Linux, assuming the dependencies have been met, the build procedure looks like this:\n\n```\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake\n```\n\nSame for OS X, but the pkg-config path needs to be hooked up from macports first:\n\n```\necho \"/opt/local/share/aclocal\" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/aclocal/dirlist\n```\n\nFor mingw it's the same, but you will need to provide lots of paths in the form of:\n\n```\n./autogen.sh\nexport STAGING=/path/to/extracted/libs\n./configure CPPFLAGS=-I$STAGING LDFLAGS=-L$STAGING --prefix=$STAGING --host=i586-mingw32msvc --with-qt-bindir=$STAGING/host/bin --with-qt-plugindir=$STAGING/plugins --with-qt-incdir=$STAGING --with-boost=$STAGING --with-protoc-bindir=$STAGING/host/bin\nmake\n```\n\nIn addition, there are helpers for qt and boost to help with finding some locations.\nUse ./configure --help to see the available options.\n\nNative windows built is untested, as I don't have a windows environment at my disposal.\n\n'make check' will run the unit tests and print the results.\n\nI've done my best to avoid adding any new behavior or features, and I would much prefer to aim for feature-parity before making any improvements.\n",

          "title": "Autotools RFC: Round 2",
          "body": "Changes since Round 1:\n- Rebased on current master\n- Moved configure to root srcdir, and added a Makefile there\n- Split into several Makefile.am's with recursive build [1]\n- Work towards building correctly under gitian\n- Fixed/verified several build scenarios\n- Fixed up 'make dist' to work as a viable end-result packaging mechanism [2]\n1. Personally I believe that splitting up the build is a major regression from RFC1. This was done by request here. Most projects end up spending lots of time moving in the opposite direction, as a recursive build tends to be slower, more complicated, and more-error prone. That proves to be the case here as well, but I've attempted to handle it as gracefully as possible.\n2. 'make dist' can be used to produce a bootstrapped tarball with git information included, intended for distribution as an 'official source release'. This is the equivalent of taking a fresh git clone, running './autogen.sh', and tar'ing up the result. This is the common procedure for autotools projects.\n\nAt this point I consider it to be merge-ready, with the exception of verification of gitian descriptors and documentation. Presumably removal of the old makefile.\\* would coincide with updated documentation. Several things can be improved and cleaned up after merge (dealing with versioning, for example), but I've tried to ignore these things as much as possible for the sake of a quick merge.\n\nEdit: Removed crazy markup that looked like yelling -- sorry.\n## \n\nHere is the second go at an Autotools build system replacement. It is meant to be a drop-in replacement for the current system(s), providing the same features with no net changes. It can also live side-by-side with the old system while sharing the same build-related variables in order to facilitate a smooth transition.\n\nI hope the benefits are obvious enough: A single/shared build procedure, portability, ease of packaging, ease for downstreams, ease for repository maintainers, cross-compilation, etc. I don't vouch for Autotools in any way, in fact, this configure.am is downright ugly (mainly just because of mingw though), but it's portable and well-established.\n\nI've opted not to write the documentation yet, because I would like to see what comments/concerns come out of the first round of review before committing to anything.\n\nThis does away with the need for qmake, as the Makefile is capable of generating everything it needs in a portable way.\n\nQt-creator can be used with the Autotools plugin, and is working nicely. For those who wish to use it this way, install the Autotools plugin from the 'about' menu, then open Makefile.am as a project. It handles the build procedure, so there is no need to mess with the command-line procedures listed below.\n\nBuilding from CLI:\nFor Linux, assuming the dependencies have been met, the build procedure looks like this:\n\n```\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake\n```\n\nSame for OS X, but the pkg-config path needs to be hooked up from macports first:\n\n```\necho \"/opt/local/share/aclocal\" | sudo tee -a /usr/share/aclocal/dirlist\n```\n\nFor mingw it's the same, but you will need to provide lots of paths in the form of:\n\n```\n./autogen.sh\nCPPFLAGS=\"-I/path/to/include -I/path/to/other/include\" LDFLAGS=\"-L/path/to/libs -L/path/to/other/libs\" ./configure\nmake\n```\n\nIn addition, there are helpers for qt and boost to help with finding some locations.\nUse ./configure --help to see the available options.\n\nNative windows built is untested, as I don't have a windows environment at my disposal.\n\nGitian should be working for win32 builds. I've guessed at Linux but have not yet verified.\n\n'make check' will run the unit tests and print the results.\n\nI've done my best to avoid adding any new behavior or features, and I would much prefer to aim for feature-parity before making any improvements.\n\nTODO:\n- Verify gitian descriptors.\n- Add documentation\n",

      "body": "Just pushed a boatload of fixes. Sorry for yet another round of changes, but this has turned out to be much more complicated than originally anticipated. I can squash down before merge, but I decided to push individual changes in case anyone is following the progress.\n\nFully verified on osx now that my macbook is up and running again (yay!).\n\nI also scrapped the 'windows-deploy' target and replaced it with the generic 'deploy' one. 'make deploy' on osx will produce a fully-functional dmg. When building for windows, 'make deploy' will create a fully-functional win32 installer.\n\nAt this point, it's feeling very very solid. That said, I only have osx 10.6 at my disposal currently, so it hasn't been tested on 10.7/10.8 yet.\n\n@fanquake: Tested extensively with macports and homebrew after today's changes. The build procedure is pretty much: install macports/homebrew depends as before, but with automake/autoconf added. Additionally, you can install qt directly from macports/homebrew and it should just work (tm). After that, standard configure+make should be all it takes.\n\nI'll try to get the osx docs written+pushed tomorrow.\n",

There's also really no need for distinction between qt/non-qt builds anymore.\n\nMy intention is essentially:\n- Platform-specific dependencies. A readme for each platform detailing what needs to be done before ./autogen.sh. Basically documenting the part you just went through.\n- Building bitcoin. How to bootstrap and configure. See ./configure --help for options. Pitfalls. What do I do when X?\n- Distribution notes. How to package, release, etc.\n- Testing. \n\nThe problem with the above is that I need a good bit of feedback. I've been looking at this (and working on other autotools projects) for so long that it's become hard to tell what's non-obvious. I don't think I'll receive much feedback until it's merged and there are more devs exposing its warts.\n\nSo my proposal is to do a quick readme with monkey-style copy/paste commands for the various platforms, and let that suffice until merge. Post-merge, the above outline could be much more easily worked out.\n\nThoughts?\n",

Once the system is working \"en grosse\" merge it, leaving sector experts and motivated parties to hammer out the final details.  In particular, Qt will likely need additional attention after merge, it sounds like.  That's OK.  We are not going to have 0.9-rc1 tomorrow or next week.\n\nThe first three seem to be well on their way to being completed.  The last is the toughie, IMO:  need to get our pulltester back in working order almost immediately after merge, so we need to beg BlueMatt for some time or hopefully grow some more pulltester experts (I am entirely hands-off Java, not being a fan of the language).\n\ntl;dr: Let's not endlessly iterate this outside of 'master'.

The big benefit is that everything is now in-tree, so if they change in the future, there's no worry of getting out of sync with the build procedure. Additionally, devs can run the script and yield the same result as the bot.\n\n@TheBlueMatt ping. With any luck, the bot just needs to run test-scripts/pull-tester.sh .
