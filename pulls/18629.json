    "body": "The `ld` in binutils has historically had a few issues with PE binaries, there's a good summary in this [thread](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19011). \r\n\r\nOne issue in particular was `ld` stripping the `.reloc` section out of PE binaries, even though it's required for functioning ASLR. This was [reported by a Tor developer in 2014](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17321) and they have been patching their [own binutils](https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-build.git/tree/projects/binutils) ever since. However their patch only made it into binutils at the [start of this year](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=dc9bd8c92af67947db44b3cb428c050259b15cd0). It adds an `--enable-reloc-section` flag, which is turned on by default if you are using `--dynamic-base`. In the mean time this issue has also been worked around by other projects, such as FFmpeg, see [this commit](https://github.com/TheRyuu/FFmpeg/commit/91b668acd6decec0a6f8d20bf56e2644f96adcb9).\r\n\r\nI have checked our recent supported Windows release binaries, and they do contain a `.reloc` section. From what I understand, we are using all the right compile/linker flags, including `-pie` & `-fPIE`, and have never run into the crashing/entrypoint issues that other projects might have seen.\r\n\r\nOne other thing worth noting here, it how Debian/Ubuntu patch the binutils that they distribute, because that's what we end up using in our gitian builds.\r\n\r\nIn the binutils-mingw-w64 in Bionic (18.04), which we currently use in gitian, PE hardening options/security flags are enabled by default. See the [changelog](https://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/universe/b/binutils-mingw-w64/binutils-mingw-w64_8ubuntu1/changelog) and the [relevant commit](https://salsa.debian.org/mingw-w64-team/binutils-mingw-w64/-/commit/452b3013b8280cbe35eaeb166a43621b88d5f8b7).\r\n\r\nHowever in Focal (20.04), this has now been reversed. PE hardening options are no-longer the default. See the [changelog](https://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/universe/b/binutils-mingw-w64/binutils-mingw-w64_8.8/changelog) and [relevant commit](https://salsa.debian.org/mingw-w64-team/binutils-mingw-w64/-/commit/7bd8b2fbc242a8c2fc2217f29fd61f94d3babf6f), which cites same .reloc issue mentioned here.\r\n\r\nGiven that we explicitly specify/opt-in to everything that we want to use, the defaults aren't necessarily an issue for us. However I think it highlights the importance of continuing to be explicit about what we want, and not falling-back or relying on upstream.\r\n\r\nThis was also prompted by the possibility of us doing link time garbage collection, see #18579 & #18605. It seemed some sanity checks would be worthwhile in-case the linker goes haywire while garbage collecting.\r\n\r\nI think Guix is going to bring great benefits when dealing with these kinds of issues. Carl you might have something to say in that regard.",

      "body": "Previous releases of `binutils-mingw-w64` in Debian enabled hardening flags by default, but as mentioned elsewhere, this is actually misleading since the flags really require relocations, and those were dropped. When `--enable-reloc-section` was added, I experimented with enabling *that* by default, along with all the other flags; but enabling this by default breaks `ld` in a number of scenarios. In particular it breaks many, many test-cases in the test-suite, but it also causes some problems in real-world scenarios (I don’t have the details to hand).\r\n\r\nSo I decided that it was better to advertise what we really do: by default, the cross-compiler setup produces binaries which don’t support the various hardening flags available in Windows. Projects which know what they’re doing can pass the relevant flags and get the improved security; in other cases, security analysis tools will flag binaries appropriately, and hopefully no one will be fooled.\r\n\r\nIf I (or someone else) can come up with a meaningful set of defaults, I’ll be more than happy to change them again.",
