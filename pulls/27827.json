    "body": "UPDATE: In an attempt to make review a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs.\r\n\r\n## Milestones\r\n\r\nAs next steps, these are the high level areas. Each could be its own PR, if it makes sense: \r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122 implements the BIP logic and unit tests, ready for review\r\n- [ ] Add primitivs for static payment codes to the wallet. Currently everything is modeled as a `CTxDestination`, `CTxOut` or `CRecipient`, whereas a static payment code is something entirely different\r\n- [ ] PR for a silent payments descriptor\r\n- [ ] PR sending support in the wallet\r\n- [ ] PR for receiving: scanning and managing silent payment outputs in the wallet\r\n\r\n## This PR\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the basic silent payments scheme. In particular:\r\n\r\n* Adds support for existing wallets to send to silent payment addresses\r\n* Adds support to the Bitcoin Core wallet for receiving silent payments\r\n\r\nThe following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Creating multiple outputs for the same silent payment address when sending\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `send` is covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to an indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897, where most of the follow-ups I mention above have already been fully or partially implemented.\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Notes for the reviewers\r\n\r\nThere are a few parts of this PR that need re-working but are implementation details and not specific to how silent payments work. I decided to open the PR as-is so that folks reviewing the BIP have an implementation to look at and to get some suggestions on how to better implement this in the wallet. Specifically, I'm looking for feedback on how to improve the following:\r\n\r\n* The `sp()` descriptor should be updated to implement the BIP and independently derive the scan key (currently it's just a hash of the spend key)\r\n* Both the spend and scan key are kept in their own object, it would be nice to have them only accessed through the descriptor. Another idea would be allow scanning even if the wallet is encrypted, so that the spend key is not accessible unless spending\r\n* Each silent payment output found is added to the wallet as a `rawtr` descriptor. Ideally, we have a new descriptor that takes the spend key and then stores the auxiliary data needed to construct the private key (e.g `sp(spend_key, <one of hash(ecdh_shared_secret>)`\r\n* Some of the methods could probably be better organized (e.g implemented on the SPKMan, when it could be a wallet method)",

I'd prefer to keep them together only because I see no reason to merge sending without receiving support in Bitcoin Core. In terms of work, if the goal is to merge both sending and receiving support, the amount of review doesn't change, and splitting into two PRs seems like unnecessary shuffling of commits",

      "body": ">Can you explain your reasoning for wanting to split it up? I'd prefer to keep them together only because I see no reason to merge sending without receiving support in Bitcoin Core. \r\n\r\n1. The sooner sending is supported everywhere, the sooner it is *practical* for people to use it for receiving. Might as well get that ball rolling ASAP.\r\n2. Sending support means the BIP isn't going to change under me (and break compatibility / risk coin loss) if I merge things in Knots first.\r\n3. Core refuses to care about compatibility with other software, so I *can't* merge anything that changes the wallet format in Knots until after it's in a Core release.",
