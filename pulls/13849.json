    "body": "This is extracted from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13816 to make that one simpler.\r\n\r\nThe travis `matrix` and `jobs` top level items are actually aliases for each other. The goal is to be able to specify not just the environment per job but also the `os` (for https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13816 ). So this PR moves the environment variables from the `env.matrix` section to `jobs.include`.\r\n\r\n`jobs` and build stages subsume the matrix functionality. IMHO this makes it clearer to add stages (as every item clearly references which stage it belongs to).\r\n\r\nThe `before_install`, `install`, etc. steps default to belonging to the `test` stage and were moved up .",
