    "body": "This was mostly written as a way to clean things up so that the NETWORK_LIMITED PR (#10387) can be simplified a ton, but its also a nice standalone cleanup that will also require a bit of review because it tweaks a lot of stuff across net. The new functions are fine in protocol.h right now since they're straight-forward, but after NETWORK_LIMITED will really want to move elsewhere after @theuni moves the nServices-based selection to addrman from connman.\r\n\r\nAdds HasAllRelevantServices and GetRelevantServices, which check\r\nfor NETWORK|WITNESS.\r\n\r\nThis changes the following:\r\n * Removes nRelevantServices from CConnman, disconnecting it a bit\r\n   more from protocol-level logic.\r\n * Replaces our sometimes-connect-to-!WITNESS-nodes logic with\r\n   simply always requiring WITNESS|NETWORK for outbound non-feeler\r\n   connections (feelers still only require NETWORK).\r\n * This has the added benefit of removing nServicesExpected from\r\n   CNode - instead letting net_processing's VERSION message\r\n   handling simply check HasAllRelevantServices.\r\n * This implies we believe WITNESS nodes to continue to be a\r\n   significant majority of nodes on the network, but also because\r\n   we cannot sync properly from !WITNESS nodes, it is strange to\r\n   continue using our valuable outbound slots on them.\r\n * In order to prevent this change from preventing connection to\r\n   -connect= nodes which have !WITNESS, -connect nodes are now\r\n   given the \"addnode\" flag. This also allows outbound connections\r\n   to !NODE_NETWORK nodes for -connect nodes (which was already true\r\n   of addnodes).\r\n * Has the (somewhat unintended) consequence of changing one of the\r\n   eviction metrics from the same\r\n   sometimes-connect-to-!WITNESS-nodes metric to requiring\r\n   HasRelevantServices.\r\n\r\nThis should make NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED much simpler to implement.",

The help text still reads correct to me (it still limits you to only that one connection), the only thing it changes is that previously we would disconnect-on-VERSION-message for -connect peers which do not set NODE_NETWORK, now we will keep it connected just the same as -addnode peers. If you think thats a critical change to document I'm happy to do so, but I think thats a rather esoteric case for -connect.",

      "body": "Concept ACK. Though, I believe that these lines demonstrate why \"Desirable\" is so awkward:\r\n```c++\r\nif (!fFeeler && !HasAllDesirableServiceFlags(addr.nServices)) {\r\n    continue;\r\n    } else if (fFeeler && !MayHaveUsefulAddressDB(addr.nServices)) {\r\n    continue;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```MayHaveUsefulAddressDB()``` is explicit in what it's checking, but ```HasAllDesirableServiceFlags()``` is not.\r\n\r\nI'd be much more comfortable with this (and I think it'd be much more straightforward) if ```HasAllDesirableServiceFlags()``` was replaced with two or three different functions, each representing an explicit functionality check. e.g.: ```MayServeSomeWitnessBlocks()```, ```MayServeAllWitnessBlocks()```, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter all, that's what we're _really_ trying to figure out, right?\r\n\r\nThen the flag checks aren't dependent on app state, because those checks are done in a straightforward way by the caller instead:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nif ((in_ibd && MayServeAllWitnessBlocks(services))\r\n  || (!in_ibd && MayServeSomeWitnessBlocks(services))) {\r\n    request()\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat also means that \"Desirable\" doesn't have to share the same meaning everywhere. The obvious example where that's useful is the eviction logic.\r\n\r\nSo... basically just a glorified version of the previous binary logic, except that the functions understand cases where multiple flags may be suitable.",

      "body": "The goal with the naming was to allow the place that owns network logic to have a function which captures whether a peer is interesting to us. Point being you want some function which captures everything net wants to avoid knowing about, even if that's some crazy wrapper for MayServe*WitnessBlocks, that wrapper should still exist outside of CConnman/net. Ideally, eventually, this will be in net_processing.h (ie the place where we know about what stuff we want out of our peers), but the circular deps right now make that a mess. Lacking net_processing being able to take it, protocol.h or some new header seems most reasonable to me.",

Disconnecting if you see that what you connected to was based on wrong information just gives everything a new chance (including the peer you just connected to). In the end, what node you end up connecting to has the same probability distribution to the one you'd have if you had perfect information (about the nodes you tried) from the start. Using nExpected means all the biasing logic can be encapsulated inside the outgoing-connection-logic, without needing to reason about corrections afterwards.\r\n\r\nTalking to @TheBlueMatt about this, I agree that this pretty abstract, as we don't actually want to bias based on service flags anymore (at least for the time being), and even after BIP159, it will likely be a boolean acceptable or not, instead of a complicated bias.\r\n\r\nSo, I withdraw my objection.",

This also allows outbound connections\n   to !NODE_NETWORK nodes for -connect nodes (which was already true\n   of addnodes).\n * Has the (somewhat unintended) consequence of changing one of the\n   eviction metrics from the same\n   sometimes-connect-to-!WITNESS-nodes metric to requiring\n   HasRelevantServices.\n\nThis should make NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED much simpler to implement.",
