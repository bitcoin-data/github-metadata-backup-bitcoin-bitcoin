    "body": "I find myself making pull requests against my fork (mostly on top of #28983), or asking others to do so. Currently only the Github actions are run on forks, because we use self-hosted runners for the Cirrus tasks.\r\n\r\nWhile setting up my own self-hosted runners for my fork, I ran into a number of issues. This PR addresses those.\r\n\r\nSome issues are related to me using multiple regular users on the same physical machine, rather than running every worker in a VM. Update: these fixes have been absorbed by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29441.\r\n\r\nReplaces #29259 using the self hosted workers via Cirrus instead of Github.\r\n\r\nYou can see this PR in action on this pull request to my fork: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/30\r\n\r\nTo test it yourself:\r\n1. spin up at least two [self hosted runners](https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-cli/blob/master/PERSISTENT-WORKERS.md). Either use a seperate VM for each, or give them their own user.\r\n2. Install Podman and other CI dependencies (see `.cirrus.yml`)\r\n3. Give Cirrus access to your fork at `https://cirrus-ci.com/settings/github/YOU`\r\n4. Get a token from Cirrus and use it to start your worker(s)\r\n5. Optionally set `NO_BRANCH=true`, `NO_ARM=true` and `NO_NOBLE=true` env variables (see `.cirrus.yml`)\r\n6. make a pull request to your own fork, with this PR as the base branch\r\n\r\nSecurity wise: when dealing with code from strangers on the internet, review it first before running the CI. There's a Cirrus check-box that requires approval for people without write access to trigger CI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne side-effect of this PR is that on forks Github CI is no longer runs on branch pushes. It does still run for pull requests. I could undo that, but the downside is that is Github CI would run twice in a typical pull request workflow.",

          "body": "I find myself making pull requests against my fork (mostly on top of #28983), or asking others to do so. Since I don't want to splurge on a Cirrus account, and since Github free minutes are limited, I looked into how self hosted runners work on Github.\r\n\r\nYou can see this PR in action on this pull request to my fork: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/actions/runs/7554260507\r\n\r\nTo test it yourself, spin up one or more [self hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners) (each as its own user), install Docker (maybe in [single user mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)), and then make a pull request to your own fork, with this PR as the base branch.\r\n\r\nSecurity wise: when dealing with code from strangers on the internet, review it first before running the CI.\r\n\r\nThis PR also disables Github Actions on forks in order to prevent forks from running out of free minutes (that their owners may need for other projects with much shorter CI runs). This could be made into a separate PR, or dropped altogether.\r\n\r\nThe first two commits could be split out as well.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] deduplicate yaml (can't use anchors https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/1182)\r\n- [ ] add macOS native worker\r\n- [ ] add Windows native worker (I can't easily test this myself, so might leave it followup)\r\n- [ ] prevent self hosted jobs from cluttering UI on the main \r\n- [ ] check behaviour against the gui repo\r\n- [ ] make resource consumption configurable (some function of nproc? or configured locally on the workers?)\r\n- [ ] documentation\r\n\r\nRelated: I wrote a [gist](https://gist.github.com/Sjors/cd55370fa67aa095df90c433ee9bd135) for how to run CI on Ubuntu desktop with one runner per window. The windows close if the run is successful so you can inspect the ones that fail. But I find using Github's CI web interface a bit more convenient, hence this PR.",

But what this pull request enables is running CI for pull requests, which may be from myself but also from others.\r\n\r\nI'm somewhat puzzled why Knots (cc @luke-jr) and Inquisition (cc @ajtowns) are not running into the same issues. But I guess there's at least two differences:\r\n1. Presumably they run self hosted (virtual) machines via Cirrus but with sudo permissions\r\n2. They're both still building on the v25.0 tag, i.e. with somewhat different CI config",

Haven't worked out what it should be doing, so don't have suggestions to offer, but interested to see what the resolution here is.",

(followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Noise\r\n\r\n- [ ] use EllSwift https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66, implemented in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/28\r\n- [ ] certificate signing issue: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/717, fix in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/29\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [x] persist static key (needs #29229)\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [x] create `Sv2Transport` subclass similar to `V2Transport`: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/27\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n- [ ] adjust base58 encoding of authority public key https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/721\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [x] hold on to templates a bit after a block is found https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/709 (in case of race to prevent downstream crashes, though we still wouldn't relay it without additional changes)\r\n- [ ] hold on to template transactions even if the mempool drops them (for some time)\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

          "title": "Stratum v2 Template Provider (take 3)",
          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

      "body": "One annoying side-effect of 80f338c01623469bd3347d8a2e438294512c141c is that if you open a pull request (after pushing the branch) the Cirrus tasks initially all show as skipped. The tasks are actually running though, and as they finish that's reflected on Github.\r\n\r\nThis only happens for Cirrus workers, not for Github workers (3048700bde41644f1b8b40825334b6ecc0f7ccc1).\r\n\r\nSee screenshots: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/36#issuecomment-1966883011\r\n\r\nThis seems like a bug in Github or in Cirrus's integration. Dropping 80f338c01623469bd3347d8a2e438294512c141c has two undesirable effects:\r\n1. It runs CI twice for every push\r\n2. It runs my self-hosted CI for every push to pull requests on the main repo\r\n\r\nThe new behaviour is opt-in by setting `NO_BRANCH=true`, so everyone can decide what they prefer. But perhaps there's a more elegant solution here?\r\n\r\n(marked draft to try a few things)\r\n\r\nPossibly related: https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-docs/issues/1233",

          "title": "lint: Fix COMMIT_RANGE issues",
          "body": "`COMMIT_RANGE` has problems on forks or local branches:\r\n\r\n* When `LOCAL_BRANCH` is set, it assumes the presence of a `master` branch, and that the `master` branch is up-to-date. Both of which may be false. (See also discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29274#discussion_r1504226422)\r\n* When `COMMIT_RANGE` isn't set in `lint-git-commit-check.py`, and `--prev-commits` isn't set either, it has the same (broken) assumptions.\r\n\r\nFix all issues by simply assuming a merge commit exists. This allows to drop `LOCAL_BRANCH`. It also allows to drop `SKIP_EMPTY_NOT_A_PR`, because scripts will already skip an empty range. Finally, it allows to drop `--prev-commits n`, because one can simply say `COMMIT_RANGE='HEAD~n..HEAD'` to achieve the same.",

Inside the `RESTART_CI_DOCKER_BEFORE_RUN`, only podman is supported.\r\n\r\nIf you want to switch to docker, the podman commands would have to replaced by docker commands inside the `RESTART_CI_DOCKER_BEFORE_RUN` block. Otherwise, both podman *and* docker are required to run on docker, which seems confusing.\r\n\r\n",

It helps the author by catching mistakes early and it gives reviewers the option to avoid wasting time on things that don't pass CI.\r\n\r\nThe use case I have in mind is someone who wants to improve the Template Provider in #29432 (before it's merged).
