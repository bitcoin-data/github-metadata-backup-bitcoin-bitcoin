    "body": "I find myself making pull requests against my fork (mostly on top of #28983), or asking others to do so. Currently only the Github actions are run on forks, because we use self-hosted runners for the Cirrus tasks.\r\n\r\nWhile setting up my own self-hosted runners for my fork, I ran into a number of issues. This PR addresses those.\r\n\r\nSome issues are related to me using multiple regular users on the same physical machine, rather than running every worker in a VM. Update: these fixes have been absorbed by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29441.\r\n\r\nReplaces #29259 using the self hosted workers via Cirrus instead of Github.\r\n\r\nYou can see this PR in action on this pull request to my fork: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/30\r\n\r\nTo test it yourself:\r\n1. spin up at least two [self hosted runners](https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-cli/blob/master/PERSISTENT-WORKERS.md). Either use a seperate VM for each, or give them their own user.\r\n2. Install Podman and other CI dependencies (see `.cirrus.yml`)\r\n3. Give Cirrus access to your fork at `https://cirrus-ci.com/settings/github/YOU`\r\n4. Get a token from Cirrus and use it to start your worker(s)\r\n5. Optionally set `NO_BRANCH=true` and `NO_ARM=true` env variables (see `.cirrus.yml`)\r\n6. make a pull request to your own fork, with this PR as the base branch\r\n\r\nSecurity wise: when dealing with code from strangers on the internet, review it first before running the CI. There's a Cirrus check-box that requires approval for people without write access to trigger CI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne side-effect of this PR is that on forks Github CI is no longer runs on branch pushes. It does still run for pull requests. I could undo that, but the downside is that is Github CI would run twice in a typical pull request workflow (for every PR I make, to the fork and to the main repo).",

But what this pull request enables is running CI for pull requests, which may be from myself but also from others.\r\n\r\nI'm somewhat puzzled why Knots (cc @luke-jr) and Inquisition (cc @ajtowns) are not running into the same issues. But I guess there's at least two differences:\r\n1. Presumably they run self hosted (virtual) machines via Cirrus but with sudo permissions\r\n2. They're both still building on the v25.0 tag, i.e. with somewhat different CI config",

But I guess there's at least two differences:\r\n\r\nInquisition disabled all the automatic tests except the trivial linter when cirrus imposed limits earlier in the year, and tests are only run manually by reviewers. Haven't worked out what it should be doing, so don't have suggestions to offer, but interested to see what the resolution here is.",

      "body": "One annoying side-effect of 80f338c01623469bd3347d8a2e438294512c141c is that if you open a pull request (after pushing the branch) the Cirrus tasks initially all show as skipped. The tasks are actually running though, and as they finish that's reflected on Github.\r\n\r\nThis only happens for Cirrus workers, not for Github workers (3048700bde41644f1b8b40825334b6ecc0f7ccc1).\r\n\r\nSee screenshots: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/36#issuecomment-1966883011\r\n\r\nThis seems like a bug in Github or in Cirrus's integration. Dropping 80f338c01623469bd3347d8a2e438294512c141c has two undesirable effects:\r\n1. It runs CI twice for every push\r\n2. It runs my self-hosted CI for every push to pull requests on the main repo\r\n\r\nThe new behaviour is opt-in by setting `NO_BRANCH=true`, so everyone can decide what they prefer. But perhaps there's a more elegant solution here?\r\n\r\n(marked draft to try a few things)\r\n\r\nPossibly related: https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-docs/issues/1233",

Given that `COMMIT_RANGE` is only really required for the scripted-diff check, I think it is fine to force devs to locally specify the range.\r\n\r\nThere are endless ways in which this can fail.

It helps the author by catching mistakes early and it gives reviewers the option to avoid wasting time on things that don't pass CI.\r\n\r\nThe use case I have in mind is someone who wants to improve the Template Provider in #29432 (before it's merged). I have dozens of TODO's in that PR which I'd like help with. In order to get the benefit of a full CI run, they currently have to open a PR to the main repo. With the tweaks in my PR they can simply open a PR to my fork instead. I think that's better for everyone.",

GHA does not offer it for Linux, only macOS M1, which is why I was wondering if it is possible to run ARM Linux containers on macOS M1?\r\n\r\n> It's probably not too much hassle if there's clear instructions on how to do that on e.g. an AMD based Ubuntu machine.\r\n\r\nIt depends on your Linux distro. On Fedora/CentOS-like it should be `dnf install -y bash podman-docker git && podman run --rm --privileged docker.io/multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes`.\r\n\r\nOn Ubuntu I haven't tried it, but it may be: `apt update && apt install -y  bash podman-docker git qemu-user-static && podman run --rm --privileged docker.io/multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes` (If you use docker, qemu may even be picked up by default)",

But maybe consider  dropping the word \"initially\" because I think the comment would make more sense without it. The idea of avoiding \"skip\" directive to avoid tests showing up as \"skipped\" is fairly clear. It's just not clear why the tests might initially show up as skipped but then later show up not skipped, if that's what happens.\r\n\r\nIt might also help if this said what the code does, instead of just what it does not do. The line\r\n`only_if: $NO_BRANCH != \"true\" || $CIRRUS_PR != \"\"` is a hard to parse, but I think it means: Run this job if is part of a PR, and also run it on standalone branches if the project has not set a custom NO_BRANCH variable. Not too important, but I think it could help if comment said before describing why skip was not used.",
