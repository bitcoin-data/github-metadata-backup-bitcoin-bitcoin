    "body": "I find myself making pull requests against my fork (mostly on top of #28983), or asking others to do so. Currently only the Github actions are run on forks, because we use self-hosted runners for the Cirrus tasks.\r\n\r\nWhile setting up my own self-hosted runners for my fork, I ran into a number of issues. This PR addresses those.\r\n\r\nSome issues are related to me using multiple regular users on the same physical machine, rather than running every worker in a VM. Update: these fixes have been absorbed by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29441.\r\n\r\nReplaces #29259 using the self hosted workers via Cirrus instead of Github.\r\n\r\nYou can see this PR in action on this pull request to my fork: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/30\r\n\r\nTo test it yourself:\r\n1. spin up at least two [self hosted runners](https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-cli/blob/master/PERSISTENT-WORKERS.md). Either use a seperate VM for each, or give them their own user.\r\n2. Install Podman and other CI dependencies (see `.cirrus.yml`)\r\n3. Give Cirrus access to your fork at `https://cirrus-ci.com/settings/github/YOU`\r\n4. Get a token from Cirrus and use it to start your worker(s)\r\n5. Optionally set `NO_BRANCH=true` and `NO_ARM=true` env variables (see `.cirrus.yml`)\r\n6. make a pull request to your own fork, with this PR as the base branch\r\n\r\nSecurity wise: when dealing with code from strangers on the internet, review it first before running the CI. There's a Cirrus check-box that requires approval for people without write access to trigger CI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne side-effect of this PR is that on forks Github CI is no longer runs on branch pushes. It does still run for pull requests. I could undo that, but the downside is that is Github CI would run twice in a typical pull request workflow.",

But what this pull request enables is running CI for pull requests, which may be from myself but also from others.\r\n\r\nI'm somewhat puzzled why Knots (cc @luke-jr) and Inquisition (cc @ajtowns) are not running into the same issues. But I guess there's at least two differences:\r\n1. Presumably they run self hosted (virtual) machines via Cirrus but with sudo permissions\r\n2. They're both still building on the v25.0 tag, i.e. with somewhat different CI config",

But I guess there's at least two differences:\r\n\r\nInquisition disabled all the automatic tests except the trivial linter when cirrus imposed limits earlier in the year, and tests are only run manually by reviewers. Haven't worked out what it should be doing, so don't have suggestions to offer, but interested to see what the resolution here is.",

      "body": "One annoying side-effect of 80f338c01623469bd3347d8a2e438294512c141c is that if you open a pull request (after pushing the branch) the Cirrus tasks initially all show as skipped. The tasks are actually running though, and as they finish that's reflected on Github.\r\n\r\nThis only happens for Cirrus workers, not for Github workers (3048700bde41644f1b8b40825334b6ecc0f7ccc1).\r\n\r\nSee screenshots: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/36#issuecomment-1966883011\r\n\r\nThis seems like a bug in Github or in Cirrus's integration. Dropping 80f338c01623469bd3347d8a2e438294512c141c has two undesirable effects:\r\n1. It runs CI twice for every push\r\n2. It runs my self-hosted CI for every push to pull requests on the main repo\r\n\r\nThe new behaviour is opt-in by setting `NO_BRANCH=true`, so everyone can decide what they prefer. But perhaps there's a more elegant solution here?\r\n\r\n(marked draft to try a few things)\r\n\r\nPossibly related: https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-ci-docs/issues/1233",

Inside the `RESTART_CI_DOCKER_BEFORE_RUN`, only podman is supported.\r\n\r\nIf you want to switch to docker, the podman commands would have to replaced by docker commands inside the `RESTART_CI_DOCKER_BEFORE_RUN` block. Otherwise, both podman *and* docker are required to run on docker, which seems confusing.\r\n\r\n",

It helps the author by catching mistakes early and it gives reviewers the option to avoid wasting time on things that don't pass CI.\r\n\r\nThe use case I have in mind is someone who wants to improve the Template Provider in #29432 (before it's merged). I have dozens of TODO's in that PR which I'd like help with. In order to get the benefit of a full CI run, they currently have to open a PR to the main repo. With the tweaks in my PR they can simply open a PR to my fork instead. I think that's better for everyone.",
