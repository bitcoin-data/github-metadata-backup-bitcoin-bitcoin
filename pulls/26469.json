    "body": "Affects the `getblock` rpc call with the goal of adding the ability to call `getblock` with a hash or block height whist not impacting compatibility with existing services that rely on the `getblock` call. \r\n\r\n### **Motivation** \r\nDecrease the number of RPC calls needed to get valid data from `getblock` where the user has only a block height available. As well as reduce complexity, bandwidth, and overhead. _Note: `getblock` returns the hash of the block when parsed._\r\n\r\n### **Overview** ###\r\nIt is trivial to implement a check where the input univalue string (string) to `getblock` is greater than or less than a length of 64. This is because all valid block header hashes are a length of 64. This means if the input is not length 64 we should attempt to interpret the string as a block height input and pass it to `ParseHashOrHeight`  and then retreive the `phashBlock` (hash) value from the returned block at the input height. This hash value can be dropped into the existing `blockhash` variable leaving the rest of the call unmodified. \r\n\r\nIf the length of the input is 64 the univalue is treated as a blockhash and passed though `ParseHashOrHeight` to get the block header hash value.\r\n\r\n### **Contentious Points** ###\r\n**Ambiguity**\r\n\r\nThe fact that a user can now parse a **hash** or a **block height** as the required input argument to param[0]. There may be the issue of inputs being seen as too flexible or ambiguous. \r\n\r\nMy thoughts behind this are because a valid `getblock` hash input will always be a univalue string with length of 64 there _likely_ wont be a base10 block height collision with the base16 hash inputs for  1.9*10^58 years assuming a block time of ~10 mins. Well before the collision of the block height with hash values all of datatypes we for block height storage and parsing would be refactored to support values that would overflow the `int32_t` type. **As such a block height could never reasonably be interpreted as a hash. By software or people** \r\n\r\nThe next note about ambiguity of inputs is that a hash no matter the actual numerical value when read must be a string of length 64. Example a hash value of 0 would still need to be input as `\"000...000\"`\r\n\r\n### **Implementation Details**\r\nOverall the implementation is pretty simple. If input string is anything other than a `univalue str` of length 64 attempt to parse as a block height using `ParseHashOrHeight`. Since the maximum number `height_or_hash` input parameter value is a uint64t. We use the  ParseInt32 function with the input being the `.get_str` of param[0]. This function works incredibly well because it by default doesn't accept negative values, alpha chars. , strings that overflow a int32_t type, and symbol chars.  If the conversion to a unit64t is successful it is then safe to pass into `ParseHashOrHeight`. \r\n\r\nIf the user places a value higher than the tip they will get an `error code -8: Target block height _m_ after current tip _n_`. If the user inputs an invalid string for height then they will receive and error code -5\r\n\r\nthe `blockhash` parameter name was left unchanged for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n### **Backward Compatibility** ###\r\nShould be fully backwards compatible with all existing applications that use `getblock` and are supplying even remotely valid inputs. This is just a drop in check to see if `getblock` should make an attempt to convert an input to a block height.\r\n\r\n### **Performance** ###\r\n**Summary** +9.4% performance gain when returning details of all blocks from 0 to the tip. \r\n\r\nTo test the performance impact of reducing the number of RPC to get block details from 2 calls to 1  I wrote a NodeJS script that parses all blocks through the RPC from 0 to the tip with getblock to determine the size of the block on disk and at the end returns the details of that largest block by size on the timechain. \r\n\r\nThe control test was bitcoin core .23 where the details for each block were fetched using 2 calls, first getblockhash(height) was called to get the hash. Then getblock(hash) was called to get the details. This process was applied to every block from 0 to the tip at the time of 762535.  This test resulted in a runtime of 117m 11s. The result was the largest block size is 748918 with a size of 2765062 bytes. \r\n\r\nUsing this PR the same script was modified to call the getblock(height) and thus skipping the need to get the hash first. When run on the same hardware the execution time was 106m 32s. A performance uplift of 9.4% \r\n\r\nAs a note the biggest gains are inversely proportional to the ratio between the size of the results of getblock and getblock hash. The smaller the ratio the bigger the relative performance uplift. \r\n\r\nThis is seen when iterating though the blocks many of the early empty and small blocks the uplift was close to 2x, but as the size and number of details returned by getblock increased the advantage of saving around 100 bytes at the RPC became irrelevant. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I would disagree that they are all 'more reasonable' but none the less here are my thoughts. \r\n\r\nJust curious as to why you would say an implementation such as #16317 is more reasonable since it clearely violates multiple suggestions outlined in the [developer notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#strings-and-formatting) including the use of c_str and and atoi instead of parse ParseInt32. Then you have #14858. This solution introduces a whole new include for regex expressions and again uses stoi() and defeats the purpose of the guidelines calling for a ParseInt(n)\r\n\r\n#16345 sure could be considered more reasonable since it adds a whole new RPC call as well as #16439 since it's very different solution and removes the ambiguity of using height as an argument. Also effects multiple RPCs. Both of these PRs actually create a new way defining the argument or create a new RPCs\r\n\r\nLastly #8457. This solution is quite close to the one in this PR.  Why it's more reasonable other than it has a throw for invalid height and height out of range.\r\n\r\n",

In this case blocks are usually referenced by height or hash.\r\n\r\nThere is also overloading in the protocol: `4   lock_time   uint32_t    A time (Unix epoch time) or block number. See the locktime parsing rules`.\r\n\r\n> It seems messy, and we don't do that anywhere else on the API.\r\n\r\nFrom `help importaddress`: `1. \"script\"           (string, required) The hex-encoded script (or address) either`.\r\n\r\n> E.g. a long hash with no hexadecimal characters could be interpreted as a long number.\r\n\r\nUnlikely? Still it's simple to distinguish that block hash from a number.\r\n\r\n> Though even then I'm not convinced it's a worthwhile addition.\r\n\r\nFrom the API point of view, I think it's fair to fetch a block from it's height. From a technical point of view, making 2 calls causing locks on cs_main etc on a heavy loaded daemon is resource wasting.\r\n\r\nSo, +1 for `getblock hash|height (verbose)`.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @promag in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8457#issuecomment-237818518_\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Still it's simple to distinguish that block hash from a number.\r\n\r\nThis is currently not even possible with the current implementation .23. This is because any attempt to input a block hash that is more or less than 64 characters will be met with an error -8,  `blockhash must be of length 64` \r\n\r\nExample `getblock \"001\"` doesn't attempt to get the hex padded version of 0x01 instead the user is presented with `blockhash must be of length 64 (not 3, for '001')`\r\n\r\nThis is because of the behavior implemented in `ParseHashV`. \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/48174c0f287b19931ca110670610bd03a03eb914/src/rpc/util.cpp#L97\r\n\r\nThe implementation of parsing the hash in getblock that was a part of #8457 was just a call of `uint256 hash(uint256S(strHash))` as string input that was less than 64 chars would be parsed into a hash. example in #8457 if the user called getblock \"001\" it would parse that as `bitcoin-cli getblock \"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\" \r\n\r\nSince the implementation of `ParseHashV` into `getblock` this is no longer possible because of the check for a `length == 64` followed by a throw if that case is not met. As such the ambiguity arguments of a collision might need to be looked at again.\r\n\r\n**To the concern about the input for a block height not being a number.**  \r\n> More reasonable mainly in the sense of using a Number parameter rather than a String.\r\n\r\nSo if the block hash could be input as a HEX_STR and a height could be parsed as NUM then the idea could potentially become reasonable? \r\n\r\n",
