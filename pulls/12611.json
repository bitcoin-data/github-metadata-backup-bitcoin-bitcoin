The very first constraints (sig size checks) pretty much rule out conversion issues further down. So IMO it's not so much \"luckily\" that way, so much as it is necessarily that way.\r\n\r\n> Consider the case:\r\n> ```\r\n> unsigned int lenR = 4294967295; // std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max()\r\n> unsigned int lenS = 0;\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nIn that case, we would've already gone off the rails with an OOB read before the code in question:\r\n```\r\nunsigned int lenS = sig[5 + lenR];\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this change actually obscures the code because it's not clear at all why you'd cast those two values individually.\r\n\r\nThe intent would be much more clear if the sig.size() were cast and stored as a uint8_t, then used for the rest of the function for comparison rather than size(). At least then the ranges would be 100% obvious. I'm not actually advocating for that change, though.\r\n\r\nIMO this is fine as-is. -0.",
