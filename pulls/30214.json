    "body": "This PR contains the first part of #28608, which tries to make assumeutxo code more maintainable, and improve it by not locking `cs_main` for a long time when the snapshot block is connected, and by deleting the snapshot validation chainstate when it is no longer used, instead of waiting until the next restart.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR are just refactoring. They make `Chainstate` objects self-contained, so for example, it is possible to determine what blocks to connect to a chainstate without querying `ChainstateManager`, and to determine whether a Chainstate is validated without basing it on inferences like `&cs != &ActiveChainstate()` or `GetAll().size() == 1`.\r\n\r\nThe PR also tries to make assumeutxo terminology less confusing, using \"current chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate targeting the current network tip, and \"historical chainstate\" to refer to the chainstate downloading old blocks and validating the assumeutxo snapshot. It removes uses of the terms \"active chainstate,\" \"usable chainstate,\" \"disabled chainstate,\" \"ibd chainstate,\" and \"snapshot chainstate\" which are confusing for various reasons.",

I'm especially interested if you have ideas on splitting up documentation and code changes into separate PRs.\r\n\r\n> I am not so deep into the current state of the kernel work though, so I can not comment on that part, for example the newly introduced typing file. I guess @TheCharlatan could give his nod to that here.\r\n\r\nSure, for background kernel/types.h is analogous to node/types.h, wallet/types.h, and common/types.h. The types files are used when libraries want to define shared struct and enum types that can be used by code NOT directly depending on the library. For example the gui code uses the `wallet::isminetype` enum type, but the gui should not depend on the wallet library, so the enum is defined in a shared header `wallet/types.h`. In this PR, wallet code uses the `kernel::ChainstateRole` struct type, but the wallet code should not depend on the kernel library, so the struct is defined in a shared header `kernel/types.h`. This pattern started with the wallet library, but has been useful for node and common libraries as well, so it is natural to extend to the kernel.\r\n\r\nA more stricter separation between libraries would be possible with a more complicated structure, but having shared types files has been a reasonable way to separate the libraries while having a 1 library = 1 directory = 1 namespace structure.\r\n\r\n> > It removes uses of the terms \"active chainstate,\" \"usable chainstate,\" \"disabled chainstate,\" \"ibd chainstate,\" and \"snapshot chainstate\" which are confusing for various reasons.\r\n>\r\n> I think this is a bit confusing because it sounds like you are getting rid of this completely but it's actually just avoided where you touch the code, right?

But I think (selfishly) would like to break it up into design and usage docs because IMO that makes it way more manageable, i.e. the last commit of #29553.\r\n\r\nYeah this description was written aspirationally before I implemented this PR and I did not get around to removing all the old language. I'd be interested if you have specific ideas on how to break this PR up better. I definitely think it could make sense to move documentation / comment changes to a separate PR, and I hope #29553 can be reviewed more and merged soon, before this PR. (This is a good reminder for me to re-ack #29553)\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks for addressing my feedback @ryanofsky ! I hope we can merge #29553 soon and then I will get back to this with another full review. But it does look very good to me already.\r\n\r\n> I'm especially interested if you have ideas on splitting up documentation and code changes into separate PRs.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure if it's really needed because I find clean refactoring commits like those here can be reviewed quicker than other changes, so I would be fine to keep it as is just based on volume of the change. But I did think about it and if that is feasible maybe splitting along the lines of everything that touches `ChainstateRole` and the rest (in whatever order you think works better) could be an idea. If you feel like splitting it that's fine for me but I think I would prefer to keep it as one PR as I have already passed everything so I am biased towards fewer fundamental changes ;)\r\n\r\nAh, and since the first is a fix you could just open that as a separate PR now. That should be an easy review and merge that doesn't conflict with anything else. The docs changes it feels like it's better to keep them along the code since you need to get your head into the topic either way. I often feel like reviewing docs and code side by side challenges your understanding and might lead to higher quality review.",

For tracking the change in validity to `INVALID` once the tip reaches the target block the historical chainstate, could the presence of the `m_target_utxo_hash` (similar to how the belt-and-suspenders check is done later on) be checked instead? And for the current chainstate could the `ASSUMED_VALID` state be tracked with the presence of the snapshot base block and then the transition to the `VALIDATED` state by checking if the blocks up to the snapshot base block have `BLOCK_VALID_MASK`?",

But it's not clear that this should always be the case. Maybe a potential libbitcoinkernel application could be a fork-monitoring client that tracks multiple chains for some other reason and doesn't want to mark any of them as assume-valid. Having an explicit assume-valid state could make purpose of the chain more explicit and could let code dealing with multiple chainstates use chains based on how they are intended to be used without trying to infer intent from other attributes.\r\n\r\nMaybe what you are are suggesting could be an improvement, through, and it's been a while since I thought about this and reasons I listed above are speculative.

Could try implementing the suggestion and see if it simplifies the code.\r\n\r\nThis is what I had in mind: https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commit/9c89548c670e7b807a969e13408ff03df15143a2 (also rebased this branch to get cmake) . It is very broken in its current state though. There are a few problems with it, but I guess the fundamental problem is that the current application of a snapshot is done in relation to an existing chain and its state, and not against the block index and its state.  E.g. [the check](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L5835) for not loading a snapshot with less work only looks at the chain state, not the block index. If the chain is behind the block index, but the block index already has more fully-validated work, the snapshot application passes, but my new function would think it is already fully validated. The tests heavily rely on the current behaviour, where the best work chain is taken from the existing chainstate.\r\n\r\nThinking outside of this proposed change, is this really the desired behaviour though? Shouldn't the block index be our fundamental source of truth? I can think of a few scenarios outside of the tests where the chain being behind the fully-validated block index can be encountered, for example during a chainstate reindex, but I don't think they are something where snapshots should be supported.\r\n\r\n>  (2) to make intent explicit and make code general and future proof\r\n\r\nI would argue that adding this validity state could also make it more complicated to implement, or compose from existing functionality, parallel validation, or similar IBD speedups that might partition the chain even more.",

Also, if mulltiple chainstates might exist for different purposes, it may be useful to store information about the purpose of each chainstate and what assumptions it was created under in the chainstate itself not in blocks that it is pointing to. I think the `Chainstate::m_validity` member in this PR does both of these things in a pretty straightforward way, but if we want to replace it with something better, hopefully that should not be too hard since it is a private member, so the public Chainstate interface would not have change.\r\n\r\nOne thing this PR is trying to accomplish is making it possible determine status of `Chainstate` objects independently, without having to look at `ChainstateManager` objects and other `Chainstate` objects. But it should be fine for `Chainstate` methods to use BlockIndex flags to return their status.\r\n\r\n> I would argue that adding this validity state could also make it more complicated to implement, or compose from existing functionality, parallel validation, or similar IBD speedups that might partition the chain even more.\r\n\r\nI think if multiple chainstates will exist for different purposes, the chainstate objects will need to have some field describing their purpose and controlling their behavior. I can easily see the `m_validity` field not being general enough to do that, but it's more easy for me to imagine it being replaced by another field than being eliminated entirely. But again I think the fact that it's a private field should make it easier to change or eliminate.\r\n\r\nShould also point out the that `m_validity` member added here is not really new. It's just replacing the previous `m_disabled` member with something more positive and less ambiguous.\r\n",

Having some kind of \"start\" and \"stop\" blocks for a chainstate seems like something that is easy to understand and might also be useful beyond assumeutxo.\r\n\r\n> since you can't know if a particular block is fully validated without iterating over the whole chain back to genesis\r\n\r\nIsn't that only true when iterating over the snapshot block or when you don't know if you might come across it? My understanding is that is also what the [docs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/chain.h#L111) say about `BLOCK_VALID_CHAIN` and `BLOCK_VALID_SCRIPTS` and is also checked in `CheckBlockIndex`.\r\n\r\n> I think if multiple chainstates will exist for different purposes, the chainstate objects will need to have some field describing their purpose and controlling their behavior. \r\n\r\nI would also like to see a future with more diverse modes of validation, but I feel like we already have the `ChainstateManager` class for controlling the behaviour of a `Chainstate`. In my mind a `Chainstate` should not have to know all the details of what it is being used for, or have rich descriptive state about its own behaviour. I feel like many of the self-describing behaviours, like passing the `ChainstateRole` through a notification, should actually be done by the `ChainstateManager`. I don't think the changes in this PR go diametrically against that goal, but I am also not sure yet if the changes here really make it easier to eventually go into that direction.",

      "body": "I think I agree with all that, and think chainstate objects should just contain information for chainstatemanager to deal with them, not to have \"rich\" data or application specific data. I also think depending on what you want to do with chainstates, block status flags may provide enough information, but they are not equivalent to the old `Chainstate::m_disabled` field or the new `Chainstate::m_validity` field replacing it, since block flags only tell you about validity back to the last snapshot block, not back to genesis block.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm not really sure what problems you see with chainstates knowing their role or validity, but it is true they continue to know some of that information after this PR just like they knew it before. If you want to move that information elsewhere like chainstate manager or derive it from block validity flags I don't think this PR should get in the way of that, and it probably even helps a little because it narrows the definition of `ChainstateRole` to not indicate assumeutxo status but only indicate basic information about whether the chainstate is validated and what block it is targeting. The PR should also help more if you are interested in using chainstate objects for applications other than assumeutxo, because it is dropping assumeutxo-specific assumptions many places in validation and networking code and adding a generic `ChainstateManager::m_chainstates` vector that can hold arbitrary chainstates.\r\n\r\nI'd also point out that the `Chainstate::m_validity` field only gets written in 2 places: in the `Chainstate` constructor and in the `ChainstateManager::MaybeCompleteSnapshotValidation` method, so I don't think it adds much maintenance burden even if you think other fields might be more useful.",

This makes\nChainstate objects more self contained, so it's possible for validation code to\nlook at one Chainstate object and know what blocks to connect to it without\nneeding to consider global validation state or look at other Chainstate\nobjects.\n\nThe motivation for this change is to make validation and networking code more\nreadable, so understanding it just requires knowing about chains and blocks,\nnot reasoning about assumeutxo download states. This change also enables\nsimplifications to the ChainstateManager interface in subsequent commits, and\ncould make it easier to implement new features like creating new Chainstate\nobjects to generate UTXO snapshots or index UTXO data.\n\nNote that behavior of the MaybeCompleteSnapshotValidation function is not\nchanging here but some checks that were previously impossible to trigger like\nthe BASE_BLOCKHASH_MISMATCH case have been turned into asserts.",

This has several benefits:\n\n- Ensures ChainstateManager treats chainstates instances equally, making\n  distinctions based on their attributes, not having special cases and making\n  assumptions based on their identities.\n\n- Normalizes ChainstateManager representation so states that should be\n  impossible to reach and validation code has no handling for (like\n  m_snapshot_chainstate being set and m_ibd_chainstate being unset, or both\n  being set but m_active_chainstate pointing to the m_ibd_chainstate) can no\n  longer be represented.\n\n- Makes ChainstateManager more extensible so new chainstates can be added for\n  different purposes, like indexing or generating and validating assumeutxo\n  snapshots without interrupting regular node operations. With the\n  m_chainstates member, new chainstates can be added and handled without needing\n  to make changes all over validation code or to copy/paste/modify the existing\n  code that's been already been written to handle m_ibd_chainstate and\n  m_snapshot_chainstate.\n\n- Avoids terms that are confusing and misleading:\n\n  - The term \"active chainstate\" term is confusing because multiple chainstates\n    will be active and in use at the same time. Before a snapshot is validated,\n    wallet code will use the snapshot chainstate, while indexes will use the IBD\n    chainstate, and netorking code will use both chainstates, downloading\n    snapshot blocks at higher priority, but also IBD blocks simultaneously.\n\n  - The term \"snapshot chainstate\" is ambiguous because it could refer either\n    to the chainstate originally loaded from a snapshot, or to the chainstate\n    being used to validate a snapshot that was loaded, or to a chainstate being\n    used to produce a snapshot, but it is arbitrary used to refer the first\n    thing. The terms \"most-work chainstate\" or \"assumed-valid chainstate\" should\n    be less ambiguous ways to refer to chainstates loaded from snapshots.\n\n  - The term \"IBD chainstate\" is not just ambiguous because actively confusing\n    because technically IBD ends and the node is considered synced when the\n    snapshot chainstate finishes syncing, so in practice the IBD chainstate\n    will mostly by synced after IBD is complete. The term \"fully-validated\" is\n    a better way of describing the characteristics and purpose of this\n    chainstate.",

If so, why don't we need to check it on every iteration of the do loop further down? What if it is actually reached, will validation on that chain just always be stuck in an unrecoverable state? Wouldn't a fatal error be more appropriate then?\r\n\r\nThis is labeled as \"Belt-and-suspenders check\" so it should be safe to assume that it is not required. Sometimes it is useful to have checks for unexpected states that should never happen, so it is possible to detect bugs that may otherwise go unnoticed, or to provide better debug information if the unexpected state does lead to a problem later. \r\n\r\nSometimes unexpected states should trigger asserts or fatal errors, but sometimes they don't need to be fatal and can just trigger warnings like this one. In this case the unexpected state may cause the current snapshot to never get fully validated (if the background chainstate is disabled), but since the node will still be functional, and the user might be able to recover from it by loading another snapshot, maybe it is not worth causing a fatal error. Also it might make sense to have this check at the top of this function not in the loop below because it is checking a precondition: looking for an invalid state set by previous code, not invalid state set by this code. It may be possible to improve this by adding other checks, though. And it would probably be good to use `if (Assume(...))` here so if this condition is reached it will be detected in fuzz and debug builds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is replacing the `index_new.nHeight < snapshot_base_height` check with a `ReachedTarget()` check, and combining the `return SKIPPED` it triggers with the earlier one with a more complete comment about when SKIPPED is returned.\r\n\r\nThe other changes to this function that happen in later commit don't really affect these things, they just pass new parameters into this function so it can be more independent of ChainstateManager.",

But I'm happy to change if the project wants to make a wider switch to \"present\" or someone can explain why writing \"present\" is better than writing the current year and never updating it. I couldn't find much discussion about this topic, but https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/4885/copyright-until-the-present-year-in-bsd-license seems to back up my suspicions here.",

What is wrong with using `CurrentChainstate` here?\r\n\r\nIMO chainstatemanager should generally just validate and update chainstates with incoming data and not rely on concept of a \"current\" chainstate. The concept of a current chainstate is a little vague and makes more sense at the appilcation level than this level. For example wallets will treat chainstates loaded from assumeutxo snapshots as the current chainstate while indexes ignore that chainstate and treat the fully validated background chainstate as the current one.\r\n\r\nMore specifically in this case avoiding `CurrentChainstate()` makes this code more correct, and would avoid a failed Assume check and a warning if multiple snapshot chainstates were loaded, since loading a snapshot updates the snapshots block's `m_chain_tx_count` value when when the previous block may have a 0 value. (We don't currently support loading multiple snapshot chainstates now, but there is no reason we could not allow it in the future, for example to support loading a new snapshot after an older one has been loaded.)",

Why is that?\r\n\r\nWrote a better comment since existing comment wasn't really explaining what was happening here. It's possible this code might need to be updated to customize pruning behavior if more chainstates are added in the future. But I think default behavior should just be to reserve block storage for the two chainstates we know about: the most-work chainstate and a historical chainstate, not to reserve storage for an arbitrary number of chainstates which may or may not need it.",

And thanks for digging into the test. I added comments to try to make it less confusing. For reference the test was added [in e4d7995](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25667/commits/e4d799528696c5ede38c257afaffd367917e0de8#diff-dbada1fe3a3d0af884304dd28be8c9df74b592401dec2c6400f6b491aefe6c9bR472) and seems basically unchanged since when it was written.\r\n\r\n> First, there is a comment saying \"Test that simulating a shutdown (...) we end up with a single chainstate that is at tip\", followed by a check that there are still 2 chainstates - so the test contradicts itself.\r\n\r\nGood catch, the comment is wrong. If you search for \"single chainstate\" you can see the same comment is copied from 2 other tests in this file and is ok in those places. Fixed in latest push.\r\n\r\n> Then the test calls the test-only function `LoadVerifyActivateChainstate` which only calls ABC for the active chainstate, instead of doing it for all chainstates like its counterpart in `ImportBlocks()` during actual init does - why is this using an artificial init process that differs from the way it's done in production?\r\n\r\nI don't know the answer to this. The unit tests do a lot of artificial things and I'd agree it is usually better when we can remove artificial code so tests are more realistic and there is less code to maintain.\r\n\r\n> Because of that, only during `mineBlocks()` (as a result of `ProcessNewBlock()` calling ABC for both chainstates) the block that was previously disconnected in a hacky way (by simply calling `DisconnectBlock()` instead of e.g. invalidating it) is being connected again, and the background snapshot is verified, which is a surprising side effects of just trying to connect some blocks on the tip - and the actual reason why the height is suddenly 110.\r\n\r\nAdded a comment about that instead of changing it so this is still a focused bugfix. Agree if test were more realistic it might be clearer.\r\n\r\n> I think that this deserves an explanation, but more importantly, I don't see the point / strategy of the subtest in general - what situation is it actually trying to test?\r\n\r\nI think the main thing it is trying to test is `BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(chainstates.size(), 2);` i.e. \"that snapshot chainstates initialize properly when found on disk\" and that the chainstates function as expected when more blocks are mined. Expanded the comment at the top of the test, too.\r\n\r\n> I realize that this isn't really what this PR is about, so maybe there could be a separate PR to clean this test up properly, especially if the other subtests (which I didn't check) would have similar problems?\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice if tests were more realistic, and the main thing that annoys me about these tests that is instead of using literal numbers and expressions, the tests like to declare lots of helper variables, so there are many similarly named variables it it is difficult to keep track of what they all mean and how they are used. It probably would be nice to clean these tests up and make them simpler, though not a priority.\r\n",

Ultimately I think it would be best to  drop the `m_target_utxohash` member and just check the `ReachedTarget()` condition everywhere instead of using `m_target_utxohash.has_value()`. But this needs to be done carefully, and it might require getting rid of some \"belt and suspenders\" checks in the current code which are technically unnecessary but give some confidence the code works correctly.\r\n\r\nThis commit is a more of a pure refactoring and tries to keep code the working the way it does currently, but add transparency so it clearer why it works and what assumptions it is making. It's trying to replace the opaque `m_disabled` bool which could indicate either (1) that the chainstate target is invalid or (2) that a chainstate is valid but no longer in use after its utxo hash was checked. Storing the utxo hash in the latter state seemed more natural representation than adding a `bool utxohash_checked` member, but I could switch to that if preferred.",

Does background validation then just continue on indefinitely?\r\n\r\nI think you are right and there is an improvement that can be made here. The case where the validation chainstate tip somehow points to a higher block than than target block (snapshot block) is supposed to be impossible and should never occur. That case used to return `BASE_BLOCKHASH_MISMATCH`, but was changed here to trigger an Assert instead, so the code would be simpler and so we would know if a bug occurred. However, because the Assert is place on line 6173 below the SKIPPED check on line 6126 I think the assert would never trigger, and SKIPPED would always be returned instead.\r\n\r\nThere are two callers `MaybeCompleteSnapshotValidation`, one is in `ConnectTip` which was ignoring the return value so would not be affected, but the other call in `LoadChainstate` would be affected and could cause the error to be ignored, instead of causing a startup failure.\r\n\r\nI think it would probably be good to add an assert to the top of this function to make sure the chain tip is really is an ancestor of the target block, to document the assumption make make it for likely for bugs to be caught.

I was trying to write a functional test to see what happens when the snapshot block is re-organized while the historical chainstate is still catching up. It seems like we already shut down the node with a fatal error in that case, because `DisconnectTip` will fail to read the historical blocks that are not synced yet. In a way that is similar behaviour to when a re-org beyond the prune height occurs. Since that is the case I agree that reaching such a state on the historical chainstate is a programming error. Should we document this fatal error case with a functional test?",

If we would like to gracefully handle the case where the snapshot block gets reorged (which would be nice IMO), I think the best way to do that would be to call `SetTargetBlock(nullptr)` to reset the target block of the validation chainstate and turn it back into a normal chainstate.",

The point of this change is to only give clients (wallet & indexes) chainstate information they actually care about instead of making them deal with assumeutxo design and implementation details.\r\n\r\nSpecifically indexes care (for now) whether block notifications pertain to blocks that have been fully validated from genesis since the indexes don't currently use snapshot data, while wallets do work with snapshots and only care about whether notifications pertain to the most-work chainstate. So this is information the API now directly provides instead of assumeutxo states that wallets and indexes had to make assumptions and inferences about.\r\n\r\nA (`validated = false, historical = true`) chainstate could also be possible and even useful if you had a previous utxo snapshot that you wanted to use to generate a new snapshot targetting a later block. Theoretically you'd want the node API and wallet and index code not to require any changes if a feature like this were added, which is now the case after this commit.",

So wallets should not be looking at `ChainValidity` or `ChainstateRole::validated` fields. The wallet only cares whether notifications come from the current chainstate or a historical one so they should only looking at the `ChainstateRole::historical` field to drop historical notifications.\r\n\r\nIndexing code could get away with only looking at `ChainValidity` since all the indexes currently need information starting from the genesis block, and `ChainValidity::VALIDATED` implies this. But indexing behavior is not ideal right now. More ideally indexes could use notifications from the current chainstate as well. It might even be useful for indexes to able to add new chainstates, for example to support partial indexing with the ability to index old states and not disrupt the node. Supporting these things would leave index code in the same position as wallet code where `ChainValidity` does not provide enough information. `ChainstateRole` by contrast provides all the information needed to distinguish chainstates currently and it could easily be extended to provide more information in the future.\r\n\r\nOne change that might make sense to connect these two types is changing the `ChainstateRole` `bool validated` member to a `ChainValidity validity` member. But I didn't implement that because that would make it possible to send notifications containing a `ChainValidity::INVALID` value which is not something validation code should do, or something wallet and indexes should need to check for and handle. Also the `ChainValidity` enum seems like something that could be replaced or extended in the future, so it would be nice if that could happen without needing to change index and wallet code.",

Snapshot seemed clear to me tbh.\r\n\r\nThanks, I'm experimenting with the names a little and not committed to this. The name is mostly used for local variables in a few places and the idea was to make the local variable names match the [ChainValidity](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/f6bb0803fb6d6de5bbde84343ac14df211ed17e3/src/validation.h#L495-L502) case names:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nenum class ChainValidity {\r\n    //! Every block in this chain has been validated.\r\n    VALIDATED,\r\n    //! Only blocks after an assumetxo snapshot have been validated, and the snapshot has not yet been validated.\r\n    ASSUMED_VALID,\r\n    //! Only blocks after an assumetxo snapshot have been validated, and the snapshot failed validation.\r\n    INVALID,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `validated_cs` has `VALIDATED` state and `assumed_valid_cs` has `ASSUMED_VALID` state. I'm thinking the consistency is good but maybe the enum case names are bad. Maybe something like VALIDATED/ASSUMEUTXO/INVALID would be better?\r\n\r\nThe name \"snapshot\" [always](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24232#discussion_r835355848) seemed confusing and misleading to me because I'd expect a \"snapshot\" object to hold the state at the point of a snapshot. And more generally I'd expect validation state to reflect what level of validation has been done, not what mechanism was used to load the data.",

What is the scenario where the historical chainstate needs the blocks to validate the snapshot chainstate?\r\n\r\nThis is confusing and it makes me realize the surrounding documentation here is not good. For example the [`GetPruneRange`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c5849663baa925a5291731e4e4013a08c811c646/src/validation.h#L1309-L1310) documentation doesn't even mention the `chainstate` argument. \r\n\r\nBut the idea is that `GetPruneRange` is called via `FindFilesToPrune` via `FlushStateToDisk` for just one chainstate at a time. And the function is supposed to return a range of blocks to prune for just that chainstate. Each chainstate basically owns a region of the chain and should only prune its own blocks, not other blocks.\r\n\r\nThe historical chainstate is responsible for pruning blocks between genesis and the snapshot block (i.e. its target block) and the current chainstate is responsible for pruning blocks after the snapshot block it was created from. Neither chainstate should be pruning blocks it did not validate. In practice, if this check was not here it would probably cause historical blocks to be pruned before they could be validated.\r\n\r\nThis whole pruning model doesn't generalize and is probably unnecessarily confusing. It would probably be better if each chainstate returned the range of blocks it *didn't* want pruned and then the blockmanager was given all of those ranges and figured out which block to prune based on the ranges. A change like that could make sense as a followup.",
