    "body": "Opening this PR mostly to get concept/approach feedback.\r\n\r\nThis is motivated by the kernel library, where the internal usage of leveldb is a limiting factor to its future use cases. Specifically it is not possible to share leveldb databases between two processes. A notable use-case for the kernel library is accessing and analyzing existing block data. Currently this can only be done by first shutting down the node writing this data. Moving away from leveldb opens the door towards doing this in parallel. A flat file based approach was chosen, since the requirements for persistence here are fairly simple (no deletion, constant-size entries). The change also offers better performance by making node startup faster, and has a smaller on-disk footprint, though this is negligible in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nThe BlockTreeStore introduces a new data format for storing block indexes and headers on disk. The class is very similar to the existing CBlockTreeDB, which stores the same data in a leveldb database. Unlike CBlockTreeDB, the data stored through the BlockTreeStore is directly serialized and written to flat .dat files. The storage schema introduced\r\nis simple. It relies on the assumption that no entry is ever deleted and that no duplicate entries are written. These assumptions hold for the current users of CBlockTreeDB.\r\n\r\nA write ahead ahead log and boolean flags as file existence checks ensure write atomicity. Every data entry is also given a crc32c checksum to detect data corruption.\r\n\r\nThe change also opens the door towards getting rid of having to reindex the block tree due to corruption (though switching from pruned -> un-pruned still requires extra logic). This would simplify a lot of kernel/validation code, as can be seen in this [commit](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commit/bfb2709e1d116d4e613601c3f0140f099530159d#diff-28f178018e05634ee3f8ddce3f4e0cec334ae69915cecf92be8299c749d8d470). The implementation here should be fairly robust against corruption (no parallel read/writes, no background compaction).\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this pull request, that could allow the same kernel feature, would be closing and opening the leveldb database only when reading and writing. This might incur a (negligible) performance penalty, but more importantly requires careful consideration of how to handle any contentions when opening, which might have complex side effects due to our current locking mode. It would also be possible to introduce an existing database with the required features for just the block tree, but that would introduce reliance on a new dependency and come with its own tradeoffs. For these reasons I chose this approach.",

      "body": "Thanks @TheCharlatan for this proposal and making the code changes.!\r\n\r\nPlease find my review comments, suggestions and some clarifying questions:\r\n\r\n1) How will concurrent reads (and potentially writes) be handled with the flat file format?\r\n\r\n2) Even if no deletion occurs, file corruption or partial writes can happen. Are you planning mmap or memory buffering?\r\n\r\n3) What would be the \"Corruption Recovery Strategy?\" -- While the write-ahead log is mentioned as future work, providing even a minimal rollback/recovery mechanism in the initial version would make this stronger.\r\n\r\n4) What would be the \"**Migration Path**\"? -- Will there be tooling or a migration process from existing leveldb-based data\r\n\r\n5) Data Integrity Guarantees? -- Are checksums or hash-based verifications being added per entry or per file?\r\n\r\n6) Consider including a pluggable interface that allows fallback to LevelDB for testing or backwards compatibility\r\n\r\n7) **Write contention and corruption risks:** -- While flat files avoid LevelDB’s process-level locking, concurrent writes require a mechanism (e.g., file locks, flock()) to prevent race conditions.\r\n8) **Portability and Cross platform related edge cases:** -- Ensure file-locking mechanisms (e.g., fcntl on Unix, LockFileEx on Windows) are robust.\r\n\r\n9) How about Handling Large Files? -- Test edge cases like file sizes approaching OS limits (e.g., 2+ GB on 32-bit systems). What would happen in such cases?\r\n\r\n10) On similar lines to point-5 -- **Corruption Detection** mechanism could also be implemented to detect corruptions very early in the cycle.\r\n\r\nThe flat-file approach is a reasonable trade-off given the simplicity of the block tree storage requirements. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are major significant challenges and risks involved with this approach as highlighted in the above 10 comments. (Concurrency, Corruption/Integrity, Performance, Migration, Corruption detection, Portability, Backward compatibility etc.)",

Waiting for Bitcoin Core to finish IBD\r\n2. Reading all of the blocks out over JSON-RPC\r\n3. Parsing them and writing them into the appropriate indexes\r\n\r\nI started on a PoC for Electrs to use libbitcoinkernel for index building to demonstrate how this could be done much more efficiently and saw promising results. However, the requirement that Bitcoin Core be shut down before Electrs could process the block files made this approach clunky. I'll revive this PoC as a means of testing this PR and hopefully provide some use case motivated feedback on the approach.",

Are you suggesting we create ~900k files and then have some subdivision within those files into 10k groups where each of those has a single `$HASH.dat` with all the headers and file pointers for the blocks in that division? Is there something we gain through that? My impression is we do the file splitting in the first place to make pruning easier. We don't prune headers, so I don't think splitting the file gains us anything. I don't think there is much wrong with just having a single file. Maybe it even helps the OS a bit to manage the file buffers?",

      "body": "How worried are we about file corruption here? I thought the main reason we use leveldb and sqlite databases in places like this where we don't need indexing is that they support atomic updates, so you can pull the power cord any time and next time you reboot you will will see some consistent view of the data, even if it's not the latest data. I didn't look too closely at the implementation here but it seems like it is updating data in the files in place, so if writes are interrupted, data could be corrupt, and it's not clear if there are even checksums in place that would detect this.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is not an issue for the PR, but it would be good to make clear what types of corruption BlockTreeStore can and can't detect and what types of corruption it can recover from. If it can do simple things to detect corruption like adding checksums, or to prevent it like writing to temporary files and renaming them in place, those could be good to consider.\r\n\r\nIf this PR does introduce some increased risk of corruption, maybe that is worth it for reasons listed in the description. I also think another alternative could be to use sqlite for this since this would not necessarily introduce a new dependency and we already have a [ReadKey/WriteKey/EraseKey/HasKey](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6d5edfcc585bab3374ae14aa7918b3e178e016aa/src/wallet/sqlite.h#L76-L80) wrapper functions for sqlite that might help it be an easy replacement for leveldb.",

We never change block files, so that is not a problem. I'm also not sure how real this problem actually is. A bunch of databases just maintain one big file and have good performance doing so. I'm still not sure what the benefit of what you propose would be.

Improving pruning behavior is also not the goal here.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I think the proof of work and integrity checks done on loading the index already provide fairly solid guarantees on load, but agree that we should do better. I have also talked to some other people about it offline, and there seems to be some appetite for improving corruption resistance. It is my understanding that the feature for reindexing the block tree was added as a salvaging option, because leveldb does not provide strong anti-corruption guarantees, but has sprawled a bit since. Removing the need to provide code for reindexing the block tree would be a nice simplification of validation code in my eyes. I think adding a checksum for the entries and writing from a log file could be fairly simple to implement and provide strong guarantees. I'm open to suggestions here.\r\n\r\n> I also think another alternative could be to use sqlite for this since this would not necessarily introduce a new dependency and we already have a [ReadKey/WriteKey/EraseKey/HasKey](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6d5edfcc585bab3374ae14aa7918b3e178e016aa/src/wallet/sqlite.h#L76-L80) wrapper functions for sqlite that might help it be an easy replacement for leveldb.\r\n\r\nThis has also been brought up by some others. While I'm still not sure that we should be introducing a new validation dependency, maybe it would be good to implement it and open the change as an alternative draft / RFC pull request in the meantime?",

      "body": "re: TheCharlatan https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32427#issuecomment-2859921949\r\n\r\nThanks for clarifying the situation with leveldb. I just assumed based on its design that it would support atomic updates pretty robustly but if it has corruption problems of its own then it doesn't sound like we would lose much by switching to something simpler.\r\n\r\nI still do think using sqlite could be a nice solution because data consistency issues can be a significant source of pain for users and developers, and with sqlite we basically just don't need to think those issues. But I also understand not wanting to require sqlite as a kernel dependency. \r\n\r\nAnother thing about this PR (as of fabd3ab615a7c718f37a60298a125864edb6106b) is it seems like it doesn't actually remove much blockstorage code, and the BlockTreeDB class remains intact, I guess because migration code depends on it.\r\n\r\nAn idea that might improve this could be to make BlockTreeStore methods pure virtual and have FlatFile and LevelDB subclasses implementing them. This could organize the code more cleanly by letting FlatFile and LevelDB implementations both live side-by side outside of blockstorage instead of one being inside and one being outside. This could also let kernel applications provide alternate backends, and allow things like differential fuzz testing. (This was also the exact same approach used to replace bdb with sqlite in the wallet.)\r\n\r\nre: Sjors https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32427#issuecomment-2861994398\r\n\r\nFWIW I also think using individual block files could be great (assuming a sharded directory structure like the .git/objects to avoid having many files per directory). That idea is mostly tangential to this PR though, I think? Possible I am missing some connections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I agree with you that if that is something we need to be able to salvage from, that the reindex logic would have to remain for it. If that is the case though, shouldn't we also be cleaning left over block data then? Seems like the user could just end up with 100's of GBs of unusable block data otherwise.",

      "body": "Concept ACK. Neat :)\r\n\r\n> Maybe this is not an issue for the PR, but it would be good to make clear what types of corruption BlockTreeStore can and can't detect and what types of corruption it can recover from. If it can do simple things to detect corruption like adding checksums, or to prevent it like writing to temporary files and renaming them in place, those could be good to consider.\r\n\r\nYeah, I think this is the heart of it. I'm onboard for a new impl outside of leveldb, but before getting too deep into the implementation itself we need to decide 2 main things:\r\n\r\n1. Is the current block/index storage layout ideal? I think @Sjors's one-block-per-file idea is interesting. Undo data could go in the same file without breaking any append-only guarantees. Not requiring file offset record keeping sounds nice. But what would the consequences be? Do any filesystems hate that type of dir layout? Would performance suffer due to a bajillion opens/closes?\r\n2. After figuring out 1, like @ryanofsky asked, what guarantees do we need to provide? Are we just protecting against power outages? Cosmic bit-flip corruption? Bad sectors? Malicious users?\r\n\r\nThe impl here with no slicing or atomicity attempts isn't very robust, but that's obviously fine for an RFC. ",

In the rare case where they happen, detecting them early on Bitcoin Core startup (before a validation-internal assert is hit) may help finding the root-cause and also could free up some developer time due to making it easier to remote-diagnose hardware issues (many of them have more than 5 comments: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%20memtest86). So I'd see it as a benefit if this change can provide stronger detection-checks than leveldb.",

And for IBD, headers-first sync would prevent an attack where someone suffix-mines >65,000 blocks from genesis and tries to get nodes to download them.\r\n\r\nThere's also the possibility of using a local salt like we do for most other game-able data, as opposed to using the actual block hash. Block data is already xor'd with a per-node value, doing something similar with the filenames doesn't seem unreasonable to me. Maybe we'd even want to for the same reason we xor the data? And if already obfuscated, we could go a step further and ascii-encode to trim the file length. Of course, if there's no real need for that salting/obfuscation, it would just make blocks needlessly impossible to eyeball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> My bikeshed color: Since block hashes start with zeroes, maybe one could shard based off the last two bytes:\r\n> \r\n> Genesis block ends up in something like: `$DATADIR/blocks/e2/6f/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f.dat` Block [896819](https://mempool.space/block/000000000000000000012f13426140d43426f9db96fe9c93d3db4ebddfbf8428) from today ends up in: `$DATADIR/blocks/84/28/000000000000000000012f13426140d43426f9db96fe9c93d3db4ebddfbf8428.dat`\r\n\r\nNote that without the block heights as @sipa proposed, reindexing would be significantly more complicated. With the current impl the blocks on disk are going to be at least vaguely in-order, the above proposal would make them random.",

Bit surprised that you immediately ran into some corruption, maybe it is caused by the library attempting to still write some data like the genesis block? I think it would be good to have a test for parallel reads/writes here as well as a demo branch for the library.",

      "body": "Concept ACK, not yet sure about the approach\r\n\r\n### LevelDB migration\r\n\r\nMoving away from unmaintained LevelDB makes sense and aligns with other modularization and optimization efforts.\r\nWhether that means switching to SQLite or a custom solution like this one is debatable, but removing LevelDB already paves the way for further migrations - which still seem somewhat taboo at this point.\r\n\r\nBefore merging something like this, I'd be interested in seeing a full migration story (including other indexes, blocks, and the UTXO set). Otherwise, we risk supporting multiple formats indefinitely. Happy to help with that.\r\n\r\n### Migration mechanism\r\n\r\nDo we need a big-bang migration, or would an on-demand, copy-on-first-touch scheme (with an optional background migrator) also work?\r\nWe'd simply check the new location first, and if missing, migrate, delete the old entry, and serve from the new location - until all migration is done.\r\nThis would avoid delays at startup, wouldn't require doubling the space usage of the full index (only the entries in flight), and could be reused for future migrations.\r\nIt could also allow us to perform *both* operations for a while, comparing that we're always reading/writing the **exact** same data. Could be enabled on CI + background fuzzing for a few months before merging.\r\n\r\n### Code structure\r\n\r\nThe first commit currently does everything. I understand it's a draft/RFC, but it would help reviewers if the commits told a story through small, focused steps.\r\n\r\nWe're also missing dedicated data structures for the new feature (with serialization, validation, etc.). Right now, the logic seems scattered across unrelated parts of the codebase.\r\n\r\nThere's also heavy repetition: magic/version checks, CRC validation, WAL record sizing. We could introduce these incrementally in separate commits, possibly splitting out helpers that could be reused elsewhere into separate refactor PRs.\r\n\r\nThe tests seem to cover a lot of ground, but I didn't see many negative cases (e.g. invalid headers), nothing with `wipe_block_tree_data = true`, and I'm not sure migration, pruning, and reorgs are covered.\r\n\r\n### Questions & notes\r\n\r\n* I understand it's not strictly part of this PR, but I agree with Sjors that we should consider letting the filesystem handle some of this. The downside is that OSs behave differently - some nodes could break simultaneously if we hit file handle or filesystem limits that we haven't tested for. This assumes there even is an OS (i.e. not bare metal).\r\n  * How much extra space would this cost (considering 32/64-bit platforms, various I/O-caching filesystems, file permission attributes, fragmentation)?\r\n  * If we stored blocks separately, could we redownload only corrupted ones in parallel - even for missing pruned blocks?\r\n  * We might also want to investigate block compression - it looked like we could gain \\~20%, although maybe only when we already have all blocks.\r\n  * Can we design this to avoid duplication? Currently we duplicate most block data in the chainstate index. Are we planning to make the blocks indexable, so we can locate a script by offset instead of storing it in the index (at least for non-pruned nodes)? This might be relevant if future migrations depend on how this one is structured.\r\n* Related to Russ's concerns: are the integrity checks meant to guard against accidental bit-rot only, or also malicious tampering? Or do we assume physical access means full compromise?\r\n* I don't yet understand pruned behavior (this may be orthogonal, feel free to ignore): what should happen if a node is asked for a block that's about to be deleted?\r\n* You mentioned that \"no entry is ever deleted\", but I'm not yet sure how that holds under reorgs.",

Otherwise, we risk supporting multiple formats indefinitely. Happy to help with that.\r\n\r\nI have no intention of moving any of the other dbs away from leveldb at this point in time. Currently this PR serves as a basis for a bunch of other applications that leverage its additional capability for allowing other applications to read block data in parallel.\r\n\r\n> Do we need a big-bang migration, or would an on-demand, copy-on-first-touch scheme (with an optional background migrator) also work?\r\n\r\nThe current migration delay is pretty much negligible compared to normal startup times. Once migrated, startup is significantly faster. \r\n\r\n> I'm not sure migration, pruning, and reorgs are covered.\r\n\r\nThis still needs a functional test for the migration, but pruning should be covered through existing tests and reorgs are not really relevant for this, since they only influence the chain and not the topology of the block tree.\r\n\r\n> You mentioned that \"no entry is ever deleted\", but I'm not yet sure how that holds under reorgs.\r\n\r\nDuring a reorg we change the contents of the  `Chain` data structure, i.e. we remove pointers to the block tree and add others back again. The topology of the block tree in `m_block_index` is not changed.\r\n\r\n> What should happen if a node is asked for a block that's about to be deleted?\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is not changed in this PR and is already correctly handled in net_processing and with our prune locks. I think a similar approach would still be possible if we do one-block-one-file.\r\n\r\n> are the integrity checks meant to guard against accidental bit-rot only, or also malicious tampering? Or do we assume physical access means full compromise?\r\n\r\nThe CRC checks are only for data integrity. The should guard against data corruption.\r\n\r\nI have also briefly looked at how this might be related to a one-block-one-file approach. I think one possibility could be to store and read the header directly alongside the block in the same file. While it is not clear to me yet what we'd do with the rest of the `CBlockIndex` data, a clear downside of this is that at startup we'd have to read the headers from a million files, which is much slower than reading everything from a contiguous, single file. I tried benching this a bit and my startup times went from around six seconds (this PR) to around a minute.",

To summarize my thoughts so far:\r\n* Getting rid of leveldb as a dependency for the block tree seems worthwhile. Clients using the kernel could then use all our existing header and block validation logic without having to rely on an external dependency.\r\n* A single block file architecture might be workable, but I don't see yet how that would improve the block tree, or make it easier to implement this change, without a performance penalty.\r\n* Being able to read block data in parallel from the filesystem directly still needs better proof of concepts to show that this is actually useful. However I still find the changes here compelling enough for the first point listed here. \r\n* Making startup faster is nice too.",

Since the scope of rolling our own logic seems limited enough as demonstrated in this PR, I think reducing kernel's dependencies (such as e.g. on sqlite) is a good choice.\r\n\r\nA couple of approach questions / thoughts:\r\n- The `blockfiles.dat` file is pretty small. I wonder if it would make sense to skip the whole `m_dirty_fileinfo` business and just rewrite the whole file on every `WriteBlockIndexDB` call, simplifying the code at the cost of increased (but I think manageable) write overhead?\r\n- If the log structure isn't going to change frequently, we could make the logic less generic and e.g. hardcode that there's going to be a single `LAST_BLOCK` at the beginning and a single `HEADER_DATA_END` at the end?

I guess this is to be expected since we usually make one big write and flush when syncing the headers in the beginning.\r\n\r\n> The blockfiles.dat file is pretty small.

It just seems wasteful to re-write the entire file even if we don't change most of it. It's kind of on the cusp of having a relevant size in that respect at around 20kb (i.e. if we ever start flushing this data on every block, we land at around another gb of writes per year), so maybe we should err on the side of keeping writes minimal?\r\n\r\n> If the log structure isn't going to change frequently, we could make the logic less generic and e.g. hardcode that there's going to be a single LAST_BLOCK at the beginning and a single HEADER_DATA_END at the end? Especially in combination with the previous suggestion, I think that might simplify the code quite a bit at the cost of reduced (but perhaps unnecessary) flexibility?\r\n\r\nRemoving the header file pre-alloc removed a bunch of complexity again, since we  now no longer need to track the `HEADER_DATA_END`. I feel like it is kind of manageable this way, but do concede that there is space for writing DRYer code. Do you think it is more readable this way?",

The class is very similar to the existing\nCBlockTreeDB, which stores the same data in a leveldb database. Unlike\nCBlockTreeDB, the data stored through the BlockTreeStore is directly\nserialized and written to flat .dat files. The storage schema introduced\nis simple. It relies on the assumption that no entry is ever\ndeleted and that no duplicate entries are written. These assumptions\nhold for the current users of CBlockTreeDB.\n\nIn order to efficiently update a CBlockIndex entry in the store, a new\nfield is added to the class that tracks its position in the file. New\nserialization wrappers are added for both the CBlockIndex and\nCBlockFileInfo classes to avoid serializing integers as VARINT. Using\nVARINT encoding would make updating these fields impossible, since\nchanging them might overwrite existing entries in the file.\n\nThe new store supports atomic writes by using a write ahead log. Boolean\nflags are persisted through the (non-)existence of certain files. Data\nintegrity is verified through the use of crc32c checksums on each data\nentry.\n\nThis commit is part of a series to replace the leveldb database\ncurrently used for storing block indexes and headers with a flat file\nstorage. This is motivated by the kernel library, where the usage of\nleveldb is a limiting factor to its future use cases. It also offers better\nperformance and has a smaller on-disk footprint, though this is mostly\nnegligible in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAlso make flags based on file existence, instead of complicated boolean\nfields. This makes the operations atomic.\n",

      "message": "kernel: Add blocktreestorage module\n\nThe BlockTreeStore introduces a new data format for storing block\nindexes and headers on disk. The class is very similar to the existing\nCBlockTreeDB, which stores the same data in a leveldb database. Unlike\nCBlockTreeDB, the data stored through the BlockTreeStore is directly\nserialized and written to flat .dat files. The storage schema introduced\nis simple. It relies on the assumption that no entry is ever\ndeleted and that no duplicate entries are written. These assumptions\nhold for the current users of CBlockTreeDB.\n\nIn order to efficiently update a CBlockIndex entry in the store, a new\nfield is added to the class that tracks its position in the file. New\nserialization wrappers are added for both the CBlockIndex and\nCBlockFileInfo classes to avoid serializing integers as VARINT. Using\nVARINT encoding would make updating these fields impossible, since\nchanging them might overwrite existing entries in the file.\n\nThe new store supports atomic writes by using a write ahead log. Boolean\nflags are persisted through the (non-)existence of certain files. Data\nintegrity is verified through the use of crc32c checksums on each data\nentry.\n\nThis commit is part of a series to replace the leveldb database\ncurrently used for storing block indexes and headers with a flat file\nstorage. This is motivated by the kernel library, where the usage of\nleveldb is a limiting factor to its future use cases. It also offers better\nperformance and has a smaller on-disk footprint, though this is mostly\nnegligible in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAlso make flags based on file existence, instead of complicated boolean\nfields. This makes the operations atomic.",

      "message": "blockstorage: Remove BlockTreeDB dead code\n\nThis is not called by anything anymore, so just remove it.\n\nThis commit is part of a series to replace the leveldb database\ncurrently used for storing block indexes and headers with a flat file\nstorage. This is motivated by the kernel library, where the usage of\nleveldb is a limiting factor to its future use cases. It also offers better\nperformance and has a smaller on-disk footprint, though this is mostly\nnegligible in the grand scheme of things.",
