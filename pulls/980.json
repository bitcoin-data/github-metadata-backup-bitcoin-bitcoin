    "body": "Okay, so my former assumption boost 1.47 would fix #956 was wrong and boost 1.49 did not fix it either. It turns out, that I could recreate the error condition by running Bitcoin-Qt and simply switch of my PC. So there were the 2 orphan files from boost interprocess that cause the problem.\n\nI found out, that no interprocess_exception was thrown, not in qtipcserver.cpp and not in bitcoin.cpp. Next step was to look through the code and the \"create_or_open\" option in the message_queue constructor got my attention. I changed this to create_only and voila there was an exception I could work with. It sais \"file already exists\", which makes sens as there are those orphan files left.\n\nIn the end I introduced a new ipcRecover() function, which is called after catching interprocess::already_exists_error. This function works with the path were the stale message queue file \"BitcoinURL\" resides and checks if the file is there and tries to remove it. If that succeeds the function returns true and ipcInit() is called again. If this fails an error is written to the debug.log.\n\nTest case with 1.47 boost libs:\n- kill running Bitcoin-Qt instance by switching PC of\n- check for stale files, which are there\n- starting the client again with the fix disabled in the code\n- no exception, no log entries and a frozen GUI\n- starting the client again with fix enabled results in a not frozen GUI and normal client operation\n\nLog:\nipcInit - boost interprocess exception #9: File exists.\nipcRecover - old message queue found, trying to remove C:\\ProgramData\\boost_interprocess\\BitcoinURL ...success\n\nI know there are many commits in here, so I would suggest to first only look at the diff and if you are interested in the history of the fix take a look at the commits itself.\n\nAs I only run Windows the Linux / Mac devs should test this code, during our discussion.\n",

But I think this definately needs some further investigation and clarification!\n\nSo 2 instances with different ports and different data-dirs currently work on RC4? They even share the same message queue, right? Then this fix needs to take this into account and I have an idea, but need your thoughts.\n\nCurrent fix version will do the following (I assume now they share the message queue file BitcoinURL):\n- start 1st instance, BitcoinURL will be created, because of interprocess::create_only flag in ipcInit() -> OK\n- start 2nd instance, BitcoinURL can't be created, because it's already there and the files is locked by the 1st instance -> triggers the exception interprocess::already_exists_error and tries to remove the file via ipcRecover(true)\n- this will cause an system::errc::broken_pipe error, which is catched and BitcoinURL is not deleted and should be normaly used in the further client execution, because in bitcoin.cpp we use \"interprocess::message_queue mq(interprocess::open_only, \"BitcoinURL\");\", which should work. Running 2 instances would trigger some entries to debug.log, but should not cause a program failure. What are your oppinions?\n\nEdit: I'm off for a few hours, will be back later :).\n",

If it's locked (i.e. by another BC instance) that won't work and I try ipcInit() again with the open_or_create mode on the message queue to use it.\nIf the stale message queue could be removed, ipcInit() is called once more with the create_only mode for the mq and a new one is created.\n\nPerhaps I can now even safely remove the #ifdef WIN32, but this should be checked by the Linux / Mac devs.\n\nEdit: The old ipcRecover() is in just for reference during the discussion, I would like to remove that one and change ipcRecover2() into ipcRecover()!\n",
