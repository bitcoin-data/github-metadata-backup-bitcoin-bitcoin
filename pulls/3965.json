    "body": "As title suggests.\n\nThis is the first step towards breaking out scripting so that it can be used without core as a dependency.\nPasses all tests. I'm prepared for heavy scrutiny on this one since it's a dangerous area. Suggestions are very welcome.\n\nA new class (CScriptNum) has been created to be a subset of the former usage of Bignum. Operands are signed 32bit, but they may overflow after an operation, so an int64_t is used to represent the internal value.\n\nFor the sake of easier reviewing, I left out any functions and operators that weren't already in-use, and made minimal changes to existing names and conventions.\n",

Your description above finally helped me put a finger on the overflow subtleties that had been bothering me, so I made a few more changes.\nThe nMaxNumValue/nMinNumValue were not enough to handle all overflow scenarios, so I split them into OperandValue/TotalValue. Also, the current (possibly overflown) value was not tested on subsequent math operations, so I fixed that and added the tests in script_invalid to check for them.\n\nA quick sanity review of those changes would definitely be appreciated.\n",

It looked correct but rather than trust my judgement I performed an exhaustive test of all possible (non-overflow) values. It only took 661m 35.921s to run:\n\n```\nBOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(scriptnum_i64_2)\n{\n    for (int64_t i  = CScriptNum::nMinOperandValue;\n                 i <= CScriptNum::nMaxOperandValue; ++i)\n    {\n        CheckCreateVch(i);\n        CheckCreateInt(i);\n    }\n}\n\nBOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(scriptnum_vch)\n{\n    for (int a = 0; a <= 255; ++a)\n    for (int b = 0; b <= 255; ++b)\n    for (int c = 0; c <= 255; ++c)\n    for (int d = 0; d <= 255; ++d)\n    {\n        std::vector<unsigned char> vch;\n        vch.push_back((unsigned char)a);\n        vch.push_back((unsigned char)b);\n        vch.push_back((unsigned char)c);\n        vch.push_back((unsigned char)d);\n        BOOST_CHECK(CBigNum(vch).getint() == CScriptNum(vch).getint());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPassed with flying colors. Overflow values were not tested as that would have extended the run time into weeks, the overflow-related parts of the code are uncomplicated, and there is adequate coverage of those edge cases in the tests already.\n\nThis eliminates a huge dependency in the script code. Great work Cory.\n",

All passed, I'll pullreq after this is merged so I don't conflict with it.  Maaku's tests were great though I had some concern that they didn't test the overflows, so I added a test for the byte-pattern a,x,x,x,b where a={1..255}, b={0..255}, x={0,255} and confirmed that it threw in all the same cases.\n\nOne point where I would like a second opinion is that the change changes from throwing runtime_error to throwing the derived scriptnum_error. I don't see any place where this would make a difference. However, most of our confidence in this code comes from unit tests which wouldn't see long-range effects and if the exception change had an effect it would be long range. AFAICT pulltester doesn't test blocks which get rejected due to arithmetic overflows. This should be fixed: perhaps by creating one block for each of our invalid script testcases, and one block with all the valid ones— maybe imported from the JSON. We do sync testnet which has the bulk of the unit tests in it, but perhaps we shouldn't release this until there is some full system test (e.g. blocks over p2p) which checks the invalid cases.\n",

      "body": "@gmaxwell Thanks for the thorough review. New test-cases are most welcome. If you'd like, I'd be more than happy to split this PR into two so that (your) test-cases can go in first, then the scriptnum changes. That way it's clear that the same cases passed before and after. Reconciling some conflicts is hardly a concern compared to the possibility of introducing a consensus change.\n\nAs for the derived throw, I grepped around a bit at the time and found that it could've only been caught by a (...), but it's very possible that I overlooked something. I considered throwing the old type for the sake of compatibility, but I couldn't find any actual usage to speak of.\n",

In the old code, the only place where bounds-checking was done (afaict) was in CastToBigNum, so when converting a byte vector to a number. I don't think there is any need for going beyond that in CScriptNum (where this logic moved to its constructor).\n\nThis means the operators themselves don't need bounds checking, and for example operator+= could just be:\ninline CScriptNum& operator+=(const CScriptNum& rhs) { m_value += rhs.m_value; }\n",

The only difference in their usage is\nthe handling of out-of-range numbers.\n\nWhile operands are constrained to [-0x7FFFFFFF,0x7FFFFFFF], the results may\noverflow. The overflowing result is technically unbounded, but in practice\nit can be no bigger than the result of an operation on two operands. This\nimplementation limits them to the size of an int64.\n\nCBigNum was unaware of this constraint, so it allowed for unbounded results,\nwhich were then checked before use. CScriptNum asserts if an arithmetic\noperation will overflow an int64_t, since scripts are not able to reach those\nnumbers anyway. Additionally, CScriptNum will throw an exception when\nconstructed from a vector containing more than 4 bytes This mimics the previous\nCastToBigNum behavior.",

So that's the minimum value of a 4-byte operand.\n\nI suppose it would be helpful to verify the operand bounds explicitly in the tests as well:\nvalid: `[\"-2147483647\", \"1ADD 2147483646 EQUAL\"]`\ninvalid: `[\"-2147483648\", \"1ADD 1\"]`\n\nI'll double-check that those aren't already there and push that up.\n",
