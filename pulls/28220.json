    "body": "This PR proposes to introduce a new interface to allow applications and second layers protocols to verify that their unconfirmed and non-propagated transactions are valid under Bitcoin Core transaction relay policy.\r\n\r\nThis new `libstandardness` interface is designed at the image of the `bitcoinconsensus` library, which already exposes some of the script verification internals to other applications. A new method is introduced `libstandard_verify_transaction` which indicate to the caller if the transaction is valid, i.e can propagate at current chain tip. For now, the policy rules as considered as a \"black box\", there is no detail (i.e `TxValidationState::m_reject_reason`) on thepolicy rule violated.\r\n\r\nThis interface allows second layers like contracting protocols relying on pre-signed transactions and efficient propagation over the network mempools for the security of user funds. E.g for the Lightning Network, counterparties are exchanging signatures for the commitment transaction and second-stage HTLCs during the BOLT2's `commitment_signed` message dance. A policy invalid commitment transaction with pending HTLC outputs not propagating on the network can be source of failure, a serious vulnerability for a Lightning implementation as [CVE-2020-26895](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002858.html) showed it. Beyond being source of loss of funds, a policy rule violation can be a source of [liquidity griefing](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003920.html) for a Lightning node participating in a collaborative transaction flow (dual-funding / splicing), where inputs/outputs are freely added by the counterparties.\r\n\r\nFor some contracting protocols, where the pre-signed txn are malleable by the counterparty it doesn't seem computationally plausible to `testmempoolaccept` all the combinationd valid under the protocol template and this would still assume some changes in our current transaction validation interface to bypass some stateful checks such as timelocks and mempool min fee.\r\n\r\nAs of today, there is no straightforward software tooling for applications and second-layers to verify the validity of the policy rules of their transactions, and most of implementations to the best of my knwoledge are re-implementing the policy rules in their backend, or delegate this verification to their bitcoin libraries. Such re-implementation is sometimes imperfect, must be updated at each Bitcoin Core policy rules changes (e.g packages policy rules) and be adapted for each protocol transaction templates (e.g for Lightning, commitment tx, second-stage tx, closing_tx, collaborative tx, legacy/anchor/taproot).\r\n\r\nThe proposed interface is introduced as a shared library rather than a RPC interface, as ideally policy rules could be enforced on embedded / resource constrained platforms such as L2 signers enforcing security rule validation of the second layer state machine (and from where one should be able to extract propagating pre-signed transactions in case of emergency recovery) and generally allow for more flexibility for applications and second layers, e.g on mobile phone where a full-node is not assumed (all caveats reserved on the lower security model in that latter case).\r\n\r\nThis interface has been proposed in the past, see previous PRs\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18797\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21413\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25434\r\n\r\nOpening the PR for now to collect conceptual and implementation-approach feedbacks. If the new interface is judged as relevant and useful, I'll add bindings in rust-bitcoin to test the interface end-to-end with adequate Lightning software.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- write documentation for language bindings write in `doc/shared-libraries.md` and maybe in `doc/policy/`\r\n- integrate as a config flag only feature in build system (e.g `BUILD_BITCOIN_LIBSTANDARDNESS` in `src/Makefile.am` and `configure.ac`)\r\n- initialize the chainstate and its associated mempool with the spent utxos\r\n- some other things",

      "body": "> This is not and should never become a thing. Every node has its own policies, and relying on any specific policy is broken by design.\r\n\r\nWhile each node can set its own transaction relay policy, economically rational nodes are expected to follow the set of rules yielding the highest feerate traffic, at the very least for the ones partaking in block template construction if they wish to stay competitive mining entities.\r\n\r\nIf the default set of transaction relay rules do not yield the highest feerate traffic modulo the restrictions for DoS robustness, this is certainly a defect or imperfections that should be fixed, and this in fact the work pursued by BIP331 / nversion3 and its implementation in Bitcoin Core to the best of my understanding.\r\n\r\nIn light of this economical rationality design goal, second-layers protocols can be designed accordingly and issue transactions ensuring they’re understood and relayed by the economically rational nodes on the transaction relay network. If they assume uneconomic transaction-relay behavior in their design and requirements, they should be fixed in consequence.\r\n\r\nIf there is a wish to define further “economically rational” I can propose the lineaments of a game-theory model of Bitcoin transaction-relay, including miners strategy on the mailing list. In the meantime, this work is only exposing our mempool validation interface than one could leverage by direct p2p message to a full-node.",

      "body": "> This PR proposes to introduce a new interface to allow applications and second layers protocols to verify that their unconfirmed and non-propagated transactions are valid under Bitcoin Core transaction relay policy.\r\n\r\nBetter to use the `testmempoolaccept` rpc for this than introduce a new api: mempool policy is a per-node decision, so having an actual node to ask is fairly natural. If you have a particular expectation on what \"economically rational\" nodes do, then configure that node be an \"economically rational\" one.",
