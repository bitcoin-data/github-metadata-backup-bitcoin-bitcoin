    "body": "The current logic for self-advertisements works such that we detect as many local addresses as we can, and then, using the scoring matrix from `CNetAddr::GetReachabilityFrom()`, self-advertise with the address that fits best to our peer.\r\nIt is in general not hard for our peers to distinguish our self-advertisements from other addrs we send them, because we self-advertise every ~24h and because the first addr we send over a connection is likely our self-advertisement. \r\n\r\n`GetReachabilityFrom()` currently only takes into account actual reachability, but not whether we'd _want_ to announce our identity for one network to peers from other networks, which is not straightforward in connection with privacy networks. \r\n\r\nWhile the general approach is to prefer self-advertising with the address for the network our peer is on, there are several special situations in which we don't have one, and as a result could allow self-advertise other local addresses, for example:\r\n\r\nA) We run i2p and clearnet, use `-i2pacceptincoming=0` (so we have no local i2p address), and we have a local ipv4 address. In this case, we'd advertise the ipv4 address to our outbound i2p peers.\r\n\r\nB) Our `-discover` logic cannot detect any local clearnet addresses in our network environment, but we are actually reachable over clearnet. If we ran bitcoind clearnet-only, we'd always advertise the address our peer sees us with instead, and could get inbound peers this way. Now, if we also have an onion service running (but aren't using tor as a proxy for clearnet connections), we could advertise our onion address to clearnet peers, so that they would be able to connect our clearnet and onion identities. \r\n\r\nThis PR tries to avoid these situations by \r\n1.) never advertising our local Tor or I2P address to peers from other networks.\r\n2.) never advertising local addresses from non-anonymity networks to peers from Tor or I2P\r\n\r\nNote that this affects only our own self-advertisements, the rules to forward other people's addrs are not changed.\r\n\r\n[Edit] after Initial [discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27411#issuecomment-1497176155): CJDNS is not being treated like Tor and I2P at least for now, because it has different privacy properties and for the practical reason that it has still very few bitcoin nodes.\r\n",

With this patch built locally you can test with your own filesystem path (example):\r\n\r\n`tor --SocksPort unix:/Users/matthewzipkin/torsocket/x`\r\n\r\n`bitcoind -proxy=unix:/Users/matthewzipkin/torsocket/x`\r\n\r\nPrep work for this feature includes:\r\n- Moving where and how we create `sockaddr` and `Sock` to accommodate `AF_UNIX` without disturbing `CService`\r\n- Expanding `Proxy` class to represent either a `CService` or a UNIX socket (by its file path)\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets for ZMQ (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27679)\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets for I2P SAM proxy (some code is included in this PR but not tested or exposed to user options yet)\r\n- Enable UNIX sockets on windows where supported\r\n- Update Network Proxies dialog in GUI to support UNIX sockets\r\n",

          "body": "`LookupSubNet()` would treat addresses that start with `fc` as IPv6 even if `-cjdnsreachable` is set. This creates the following problems where it is called:\r\n\r\n* `NetWhitelistPermissions::TryParse()`: otherwise `-whitelist=` fails to white list CJDNS addresses: when a CJDNS peer connects to us, it will be matched against IPv6 `fc...` subnet and the match will never succeed.\r\n\r\n* `BanMapFromJson()`: CJDNS bans are stored as just IPv6 addresses in `banlist.json`. Upon reading from disk they have to be converted back to CJDNS, otherwise, after restart, a ban entry like (`fc00::1`, IPv6) would not match a peer (`fc00::1`, CJDNS).\r\n    \r\n* `RPCConsole::unbanSelectedNode()`: in the GUI the ban entries go through `CSubNet::ToString()` and back via `LookupSubNet()`. Then it must match whatever is stored in `BanMan`, otherwise it is impossible to unban via the GUI.\r\n\r\nThese were uncovered by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26859.\r\n\r\nThus, flip the result of `LookupSubNet()` to CJDNS if the network base address starts with `fc` and `-cjdnsreachable` is set. Since subnetting/masking does not make sense for CJDNS (the address is \"random\" bytes, like Tor and I2P, there is no hierarchy) treat `fc.../mask` as an invalid `CSubNet`.\r\n\r\nTo achieve that, `MaybeFlipIPv6toCJDNS()` has to be moved from `net` to `netbase` and thus also `IsReachable()`. In the process of moving `IsReachable()`, `SetReachable()` and `vfLimited[]` encapsulate those in a class.",

          "body": "Introduce a generic container that provides a thread-safe access to any object by using a mutex which is acquired every time the object accessed.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nSynced<std::unordered_map<int, int>> m{{3, 9}, {4, 16}};\r\n\r\n{\r\n    SYNCED_LOCK(m, m_locked);\r\n\r\n    // m_locked represents the internal object, i.e. std::unordered_map,\r\n    // while m_locked is in scope the internal mutex is locked.\r\n\r\n    auto it = m_locked->find(3);\r\n    if (it != m_locked->end()) {\r\n        std::cout << it->second << std::endl;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    for (auto& [k, v] : *m_locked) {\r\n        std::cout << k << \", \" << v << std::endl;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nWITH_SYNCED_LOCK(m, p, p->emplace(5, 25));\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemove the global mutexes `g_maplocalhost_mutex`, `g_deadline_timers_mutex`, `cs_dir_locks`, `g_loading_wallet_mutex`, `g_wallet_release_mutex` and use `Synced<T>` instead.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n_copied from a [comment below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25390#issuecomment-1169788319):_\r\n\r\nThe `Synced<T>` abstraction is similar to what is suggested in [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24931#discussion_r890636987) but it does so in a generic way to avoid code repetition. Its benefit is:\r\n\r\n1. It avoids code repetition at the implementation sites. See [PR#26151](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26151) for a live example. Namely this:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Lots of repetitions (92 lines)</summary>\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nclass Foo\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void PushBack(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.push_back(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Foo::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::vector<int> m_data;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Bar\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void PushBack(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.push_back(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Bar::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::vector<std::string> m_data;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Baz\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void Insert(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.insert(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Baz::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::set<std::string> m_data;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nbecomes this:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Short (3 lines)</summary>\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nSynced<std::vector<int>> Foo;\r\nSynced<std::vector<std::string>> Bar;\r\nSynced<std::set<std::string>> Baz;\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n2. The mutex is properly encapsulated. With a global mutex and a global variable annotated with `GUARDED_BY()` it is indeed not possible to add new code that accesses the variable without protection (if using Clang and `-Wthread-safety-analysis` and `-Werror`), but it is possible to abuse the mutex and start using it to protect some more, possibly unrelated stuff (we already have this in the current code).\r\n",
