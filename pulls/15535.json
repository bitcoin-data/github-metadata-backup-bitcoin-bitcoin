    "body": "Pull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n",

But node A would not send another _GETDATA_ unless it does not hear _TX_ back from node B for next 2 minutes (to save bandwidth)\n\n  Thus, if B is a malicious node, it can prevent node A from getting the transaction (even if all A’s peers have it) for 2 minutes.\n\n  This behavior seems to be an inherent limitation of the current P2P relay protocol, and I don’t see how it can be fundamentally changed (I can see workarounds which involve rewriting a lot of P2P code though).\n\n  ### What does this PR fix?\n\n  The attacks I’m looking at involve preventing A from learning the transaction for 2*N minutes. To do that, an attacker has to spin up N nodes and send N _INVs_ simultaneously to node A (then InvBlocks will be queued with an interval of 2 minutes according to current implementation)\n\n  More precisely, 2 scenarios I’m looking at are:\n  1. An attacker censors a particular transaction. By performing InvBlock from different nodes, an attacker can execute a network-wide censorship of a particular transaction (or all transactions). The earlier an attacker founds the transaction he wants to censor, the easier it is to perform an attack. As it was pointed out by @gwillen, this is even more dangerous in the case of lightning, where transactions are known in advance.\n  2. Topology inference described in papers [1](https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/coinscope/coinscope.pdf), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00942.pdf) involve network-wide InvBlock. This fix would not mitigate this type of inference, but I believe it will make it more expensive to perform (an attacker would have to create more transactions and perform more rounds to learn the topology, the second paper itself notes that InvBlock isolation is important for the attack).\n\n  ### How does it work\n  This PR introduces bias toward outbound connections (they have higher priority when a node chooses from whom it should request a transaction) and randomizes the order.\n  As per @gmaxwell suggestion, GETDATA requests queue is created after processing all incoming messages from all nodes.\n\n  After this fix, if the incoming messages were [I1, I2, I3, O1, O2, O3, O4], the queue for _GETDATA_ may look like [O2, O1, O3, O4, I1, I3, I2, ….].\n\n  If {I1, I2, I3} were significantly earlier (but the difference is less than TX_TIMEOUT=60 s) than others, the queue for _GETDATA_ may look like [I2, O2, O1, O3, O4, I1, I3, ….].\n\n  ### Other comments:\n  1. This mitigation works better if the connectivity is higher (especially outbound, because it would be less likely that 2 _GETDATAs_ for inbound malicious nodes queued together)\n\nTree-SHA512: 2ad1e80c3c7e16ff0f2d1160aa7d9a5eaae88baa88467f156b987fe2a387f767a41e11507d7f99ea02ab75e89ab93b6a278d138cb1054f1aaa2df336e9b2ca6a\n",

But node A would not send another _GETDATA_ unless it does not hear _TX_ back from node B for next 2 minutes (to save bandwidth)\n\n  Thus, if B is a malicious node, it can prevent node A from getting the transaction (even if all A’s peers have it) for 2 minutes.\n\n  This behavior seems to be an inherent limitation of the current P2P relay protocol, and I don’t see how it can be fundamentally changed (I can see workarounds which involve rewriting a lot of P2P code though).\n\n  ### What does this PR fix?\n\n  The attacks I’m looking at involve preventing A from learning the transaction for 2*N minutes. To do that, an attacker has to spin up N nodes and send N _INVs_ simultaneously to node A (then InvBlocks will be queued with an interval of 2 minutes according to current implementation)\n\n  More precisely, 2 scenarios I’m looking at are:\n  1. An attacker censors a particular transaction. By performing InvBlock from different nodes, an attacker can execute a network-wide censorship of a particular transaction (or all transactions). The earlier an attacker founds the transaction he wants to censor, the easier it is to perform an attack. As it was pointed out by @gwillen, this is even more dangerous in the case of lightning, where transactions are known in advance.\n  2. Topology inference described in papers [1](https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/coinscope/coinscope.pdf), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00942.pdf) involve network-wide InvBlock. This fix would not mitigate this type of inference, but I believe it will make it more expensive to perform (an attacker would have to create more transactions and perform more rounds to learn the topology, the second paper itself notes that InvBlock isolation is important for the attack).\n\n  ### How does it work\n  This PR introduces bias toward outbound connections (they have higher priority when a node chooses from whom it should request a transaction) and randomizes the order.\n  As per @gmaxwell suggestion, GETDATA requests queue is created after processing all incoming messages from all nodes.\n\n  After this fix, if the incoming messages were [I1, I2, I3, O1, O2, O3, O4], the queue for _GETDATA_ may look like [O2, O1, O3, O4, I1, I3, I2, ….].\n\n  If {I1, I2, I3} were significantly earlier (but the difference is less than TX_TIMEOUT=60 s) than others, the queue for _GETDATA_ may look like [I2, O2, O1, O3, O4, I1, I3, ….].\n\n  ### Other comments:\n  1.

It only works with witness UTXOs because full transactions (as would be needed for non-witness UTXOs) are not available unless txindex is enabled.\n\n  `joinpsbts` joins the inputs from multiple distinct PSBTs into one PSBT. e.g. if PSBT 1 has inputs 1 and 2, and PSBT 2 has inputs 3 and 4, `joinpsbts` would create a new PSBT with inputs 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n  `analyzepsbt` analyzes a PSBT and determines the current state of it and all of its inputs, and the next step that needs to be done.\n\nTree-SHA512: 3c1fa302201abca76a8901d0c2be7b4ccbce334d989533c215f8b3e50e22f2f018ce6209544b26789f58f5980a253c0655111e1e20d47d5656e0414c64891a5c\n",

It only works with witness UTXOs because full transactions (as would be needed for non-witness UTXOs) are not available unless txindex is enabled.\n\n  `joinpsbts` joins the inputs from multiple distinct PSBTs into one PSBT. e.g. if PSBT 1 has inputs 1 and 2, and PSBT 2 has inputs 3 and 4, `joinpsbts` would create a new PSBT with inputs 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n  `analyzepsbt` analyzes a PSBT and determines the current state of it and all of its inputs, and the next step that needs to be done.\n\nTree-SHA512: 3c1fa302201abca76a8901d0c2be7b4ccbce334d989533c215f8b3e50e22f2f018ce6209544b26789f58f5980a253c0655111e1e20d47d5656e0414c64891a5c",

Inside the interfaces directory, .h files\ncontain abstract class definitions and .cpp files contain implementations of\nthose classes, so you don't need to link against .cpp files if you're only\nusing the abstract class definition in the .h file.\n\nAn alternative fix might be to rename all the cpp files in the interfaces\ndirectory like: chain.cpp->chain_impl.cpp, node.cpp->node_impl.cpp. But just\ngetting the linter to treat these files as independent dependencies seemed\nlike it would allow keeping code organization straightforward and avoiding\nthe need to rename things.",
