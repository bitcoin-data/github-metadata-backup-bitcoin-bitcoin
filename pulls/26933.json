    "body": "Part of package relay, see #27463.\r\n\r\nNote that this still allows packages to bump transactions that are below the dynamic mempool minimum feerate, which means this still solves the \"mempool is congested and my presigned 1sat/vB tx is screwed\" problem for all transactions.\r\n\r\nOn master, the package policy (only accessible through regtest-only RPC submitpackage) allows 0-fee (or otherwise below min relay feerate) transactions if they are bumped by a child. However, with default package limits, we don't yet have a DoS-resistant way of ensuring these transactions remain bumped throughout their time in the mempool. Primarily, the fee-bumping child may later be replaced by another transaction that doesn't bump the parent(s). The parent(s) could potentially stay bumped by other transactions, but not enough to ever be selected by the `BlockAssembler` (due to `blockmintxfee`).\r\n\r\nFor example, (tested [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commits/26933-motivation)):\r\n- The mempool accepts 24 below-minrelayfeerate transactions (\"0-fee parents\"), all bumped by a single high-fee transaction (\"the fee-bumping child\"). The fee-bumping child also spends a confirmed UTXO.\r\n- Two additional children are added to each 0-fee parent. These children each pay a feerate slightly above the minimum relay feerate (e.g. 1.9sat/vB) such that, for each 0-fee parent, the total fees of its two children divided by the total size of the children and parent is above the minimum relay feerate.\r\n- If a block template is built now, all transactions would be selected.\r\n- A transaction replaces the the fee-bumping child, spending only the confirmed UTXO and not any of the outputs from the 0-fee parents.\r\n - The 0-fee parents now each have 2 children. Their descendant feerates are above minrelayfeerate, which means that they remain in the mempool, even if the mempool evicts all below-minrelayfeerate packages.\r\n - If a block template is built now, none of the 0-fee parents or their children would be selected.\r\n - Even more low-feerate descendants can be added to these below-minrelayfeerate packages and they will not be evicted until they expire or the mempool reaches capacity.\r\n\r\nUnless we have a DoS-resistant way of ensuring package CPFP-bumped transactions are always bumped, allowing package CPFP to bump below-minrelayfeerate transactions can result in these problematic situations. See #27018 which proposes a partial solution with some limitations, and contains discussion about potential improvements to eviction strategy. While no adequate solution exists, for now, avoid these situations by requiring all transactions to meet min relay feerate.",

          "body": "This contains everything to make mempool/validation logic ready for package relay (see #27463).\r\n\r\nDesign goals:\r\n- Be able to gracefully deal with any arbitrary list of transactions (these come from p2p)\r\n- Validate any ancestor package so that the incentive-compatible transactions end up in our mempool.\r\n  - If the transactions would be accepted individually, they should also be accepted through `AcceptPackage`. We don't want to accidentally reject things just because we happened to download them as a package.\r\n  - Bug prior to these changes: we required `IsChildWithParents` but if there were dependencies between the parents, we could end up (1) accepting a low-feerate child or (2) rejecting a high-feerate parent CPFPing another parent. See the \"interdependent parents\" test case for a specific example.\r\n- Be DoS-resistant.\r\n   - Avoid quadratic validation costs.\r\n   - Avoid loading a lot of stuff from disk, or loading repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 main improvements to package evaluation here:\r\n(1) We submit transactions with their in-package ancestor sets.\r\n\t-  See unit test `package_ppfp`: without this change, we would reject everything.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_ppfc`: shows that this doesn't let us do \"parent pays for child;\" we only do this when the individual and ancestor feerates meet mempool minimum feerate\r\n(2) We linearize the package transactions based on ancestor set scoring.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_needs_reorder`: without this change, if we use the original order of transactions, we would only accept 1 grandparent, even if we submit subpackages.\r\n\t- See unit test `package_desc_limits`: without this change, we accept one of the lower-feerate transactions (a bit more of a \"nice to have\" than a \"must have\" example).\r\n\r\nA description of the package validation logic (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26711#issuecomment-1647523520):\r\n\r\n- Basic sanitization. Quit if it's too big, inconsistent, etc.\r\n- Linearize (Topological sort only)\r\n- **PreChecks loop** For each tx, grab UTXOs to calculate fees and filter out anything we should skip:\r\n    - If already in mempool (or same txid in mempool), mark as skip\r\n    - If missing inputs or conflict, record this failure and mark this and all descendants as skip.\r\n    - If no failures or TX_SINGLE_FAILURE, continue\r\n    - For some failures that we expect due to differing chainstates, skip these transactions and their descendants, but continue.\r\n    - Otherwise, record this failure and mark that we will `quit_early` (i.e. not do the Subpackage validation loop).\r\n- Refine our linearization using the fee information.\r\n- **Subpackage validation loop** For each transaction in the new linearized order:\r\n    - Get the transaction's ancestor subpackage.\r\n    - If the feerate of this transaction is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - If the feerate of this subpackage is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - Otherwise, try to submit the subpackage, using `AcceptSingleTransaction()` if it's just 1 tx\r\n    - if at any point we get a non-fee-related error, abort all.\r\n- Call `LimitMempoolSize`\r\n- Backfill results:\r\n    - If the transaction was in mempool, check to see if it's still there in case it was trimmed in `LimitMempoolSize`.\r\n    - Try to use results from the subpackage validation loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early), use results from prechecks loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early and we hadn't found a failure with it yet), fill with `TX_UNKNOWN`.\r\n\r\nThis means we will call `PreChecks` for each transaction 2 times (fewer if we quit early), and run all other validation checks at most 1 time. A transaction shouldn't be validated in the subpackage validation loop more than once.",

          "body": "See #27463 for overall package relay tracking. This PR is in draft while ancestor package validation is being figured out.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A set of policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. Namely, it allows users to opt in to more restrictive descendant limits for shared transactions. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying.\r\n\r\nFAQ: is v3 still helpful even with cluster mempool (#27677) ?\r\n\r\n- Rule 3 pinning: This is addressed with v3 but not really with cluster mempool (descendant allowance is still too permissive).\r\n- Package RBF and ACP pinning: This PR allows for package RBF with v3 packages. V3 has an effective \"cluster limit\" of 2 which makes it very cheap to calculate the mining score of a v3 transaction. With cluster mempool, which also makes it easier to calculate mining score, we could have package RBF for non-v3 transactions.\r\n- Allowing 0fee transactions: This PR allows v3 transactions to be below minimum relay feerate, provided they are CPFP'd. This is because the simplified topology allows us to avoid situations like the ones described in #26933. With cluster mempool, we can allow this for non-v3 transactions.",

      "body": "> * We can remove these transactions in `TrimToSize()`, but 2500 is not within our acceptable limits.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I see why this is a problem? Can't we have the situation where 1000s of txs get evicted anyway, simply by accepting a high fee rate 400kb tx that then causes a large number of small min feerate txs (with no unconfirmed ancestors/descendants) to be evicted due to hitting the mempool limit? (At least evicting ~350 otherwise unrelated txs that way seems possible -- simple 1-in 1-out txs seem to contribute ~1150 bytes to mempool usage each for me, so 350 of them should use about 402kB)\r\n\r\n> (what if the 0-fee ancestor is bumped by something else?)\r\n\r\nWe essentially have to do the work to see if the ancestors are bumped by something else anyway, whether they're 0-fee or not (when we evict the conflicted descendant; its ancestors' descendant fee rates get updated). When we get to TrimToSize, we just look at the already calculated descendant score, and evict the low ones. But the logic there doesn't change if the lowest fee rate is 0 or 1 sat/vb?\r\n\r\n> 06:30 < sdaftuar> i think my concern is that the mempool shouldn't have things in it that would never get mined, eg because they're below minrelay fee (which we compare against in the mining code iirc)\r\n\r\nWouldn't it make more sense to address that directly, ie by having TrimToSize trim txs whose descendant score is below min relay fee, even if the mempool isn't full? Then txs who lose their CPFP child will get trimmed essentially immediately, no matter how they got in, and no matter why the parent might have been removed?\r\n\r\nI don't mind the concept here (which I summarise as \"only allow txs below min relay fee via some scheme that deliberately limits the complexity\"), but it seems more like a \"here's another special case\" instead of \"here's a simple rule that's easy for everyone to think about\".",

My concern was whether it would be problematic to have many such transactions to trim, hence these changes beforehand. If we instead decide that we're ok with this, I'm happy to drop these.\r\n\r\nSomewhat relevant, I'd also wonder if we should add a `TrimToSize()` at the end of reorgs. Same reason, so we don't add below-minrelayfee from disconnected blocks. And same concern, that it could make the process slower.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure I see why this is a problem? Can't we have the situation where 1000s of txs get evicted anyway, simply by accepting a high fee rate 400kb tx that then causes a large number of small min feerate txs (with no unconfirmed ancestors/descendants) to be evicted due to hitting the mempool limit?\r\n\r\nYes, it is definitely not otherwise impossible to be evicting 1000s of transactions in `TrimToSize()`. But since package cpfp would be a new way of permitting such transactions, I'd rather lean towards being conservative?",

      "body": "@glozow\r\n\r\n> My concern was whether it would be problematic to have many such transactions to trim, hence these changes beforehand. If we instead decide that we're ok with this, I'm happy to drop these.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that we shouldn't be concerned about using up too much CPU in such cases; just that if we are, there are other analogous cases we should be concerned about too...\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar\r\n\r\n> This is insufficient for preventing transactions that will never be mined from staying in the mempool, because 'TrimToSize' would leave transactions in the mempool if a parent and multiple children appear to have enough fee for the combined package size, even though no single child has an ancestor fee rate above the min relay fee (eg a \"children-pay-for-parents scenario).\r\n\r\nRight, but that's a reflection of us using ancestor score for mining, but descendant score for mempool removal... So presumably we'd get similar behaviour even if min relay fee is 0 -- ie, if we have a parent/children relationship like that where the parent has a high descendant score but the children have low ancestor scores, then they'll remain in the mempool while we evict txs with a fee rate in between those values due to the mempool being full, even if it turns out those txs would be mined while the child txs would not. (Though the key value there is what people are using for `-blockmintxfee` not the min relay fee per se...)\r\n\r\nReplacing descendant score is a big, possibly impossible, project though, so Concept ACK on working around it in this way in the meantime. I think it would be better to be much clearer on exactly what this is achieving though.",

I've rewritten the description to focus on the fact that we can end up with descendant packages of transactions that would never be mined but still get to hang out in the mempool. I've also written a test to demonstrate this [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commits/26933-motivation), on top of the \"evict everything below min relay feerate in TrimToSize()\" commit (to show it doesn't fix this issue), and added a description of this test to the OP so it would be in the commit log.

      "body": "Gave this more thought... I think I have a better solution to this problem:\r\n\r\nFundamentally the issue with txs below the minrelayfee in the mempool is a problem because (a) the mining code refuses to select ancestor packages below the blockmintxfee, and (b) TrimToSize() necessarily operates on descendant packages and cannot detect when this is the case.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be basically no good reason anymore for the mining code to not mine whatever makes it in to the mempool.  Philosophically, we ought to ensure that whatever gets into the mempool meets the miner's feerate criteria, and then just mine whatever is there.  Doing otherwise opens up possibilities for DoS, if it's possible to fill the mempool with transactions that would never be selected.\r\n\r\nSo instead I think an easier solution to this problem is to (a) drop the blockmintxfee feerate check in the mining code, and (b) modify `TrimToSize()` to evict descendant packages below the minrelayfee, which should be called whenever there is a reorg or whenever a transaction is added to the mempool (which could be an RBF that leaves a dangling 0-fee transaction lying around).  The result of these two changes is that we might pick up a transaction or package in block creation that appears to be below the minrelayfee, but whenever we do so it should open up the door to being able to include transactions that bring the cumulative feerate up to above the minrelayfee, because we're ensuring that every transaction has a total descendant package that is sufficiently high feerate to be mined.  I think this should be ok?\r\n\r\nAnyway, one reason I like this alternate approach better is that this PR leaves open a possibility of 0-fee transactions being added to the mempool as a result of a reorg, and I was able to sketch out a possible DoS that takes advantage of seeding the mempool with 0-fee transactions and then using those to fill the mempool up with transactions that would both never be mined and be expensive to evict (via TrimToSize()), which basically would cause the relay fees for everyone on the network to be much higher than they should be.  I'm not sure this is a very practical attack, but given that it would still exist I think an alternate approach that covers this case (with no downsides I can see) seems better...",

      "body": "> @sdaftuar sorry can you spell out what exactly the proposal is by walking through the \"24 below-minrelayfeerate transactions\" case, and why that's not a problem?\r\n\r\nSure, the proposal is twofold: (1) get rid of any feerate checks in the mining code (ie remove the comparison to `blockmintxfee` in addPackageTransactions), and (2) modify TrimToSize() so that we evict any descendant package from the mempool if the package is below the minrelayfee.  (Technically we need to also invoke this function on the mempool after a reorg, so maybe that's 3 things, but conceptually it's the same idea -- whenever we might have changed the mempool in a way that could have added a 0-fee transaction, run TrimToSize() to evict it so that we limit junk from being relayed on the network.)\r\n\r\nI believe the scenario you're asking about is one where we have a zero-fee parent in the mempool, with a bunch of children that are all above the minrelayfee themselves, but each one, when taken with the parent will have an ancestor feerate below the minrelayfee.  Originally I put this scenario out there as a DoS vector, because the mining code currently will not select any such transactions.  However if we change the mining code to skip the relay fee check, then this whole package will eventually get included in a block instead, which means that there is no free relay (because all those fee-paying transactions will be mined).  Moreover, if the descendant package in total has a feerate greater than the minrelayfee, then I think apart from edge cases around which transactions make it in at the end of a block, this is basically achieving the miner's goals anyway of including transactions that in total have a high enough feerate.\r\n\r\nIf we didn't include the `TrimToSize()` modification to evict descendant packages below the minrelayfee, then there could be an issue where 0-fee transactions might get included in a block, which ought to be strictly worse for a miner than omitting such transactions (because they take longer to validate than a block without the transaction, and there's no additional benefit to the miner for including them) -- hence that is an important part of the change as well.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "This was suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1412320818.\r\n\r\n**The Problem**\r\nPackage CPFP (only accessible through regtest-only RPC submitpackage) allows 0-fee (or otherwise below min relay feerate) transactions if they are bumped by a child. We need to know what to do with these transactions if they lose their sponsor, e.g. due to a replacement that removed the input spending this 0-fee transaction.\r\n\r\nThis is made slightly more complicated by the fact that our \"selection scoring\" (BlockAssembler) is different from our \"eviction scoring.\" Roughly, we select based on ancestor feerate and evict based on descendant feerate. This may lead to [evicting things we would actually want to mine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27018#issuecomment-1424742766) and [not evicting things that we will never mine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1400143991).\r\n\r\nThis PR's approach is to remove the 1sat/vB `-blockmintxfee` and have BlockAssembler select anything in the mempool (still based on ancestor packages, but not stopping at 1sat/vB). It also adds logic to `TrimToSize()` to evict anything paying <=0 fees. The idea is, if we're getting to the bottom of our mempool, we scrape up all the sats we can. Anything that pays *some* fee is worth adding to the block template.\r\n\r\nA major advantage of this approach is that 0-fee, non-v3 transactions can be bumped in package CPFP.\r\n\r\nA few observations which may or may not be problematic:\r\n- This increases the potential work after a reorg, since we add an extra step of removing the below-minrelayfeerate entries.\r\n- This increases the number of transactions that may be evicted in a replacement (from the worst case scenario we discussed before, it's up to 2500 entries).\r\n- This means you can remove a transaction from your own mempool by calling prioritisetransaction with a negative value.\r\n",

(e.g., better UX, attack mitigated, cleaner code, etc.).\r\n\r\nMy reservation with a #27018-only approach is we haven't answered whether we're ok with `TrimToSize()` (and thus reorgs and RBFs) potentially evicting many entries (I'lll re-post the 2500-tx scenario on that PR).\r\n\r\nMy original intent was to do this PR + evict everything below minrelayfeerate in `TrimToSize()`, which I think partially (?) addresses the problem with seeding mempool in a reorg (you can't bump both the reorged tx + a large 0-fee tx with 1-parent-1-child v3, and you can't attach multiple descendants to anything v3).\r\n\r\n> If only https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27018 is merged and this one is not, what would change to v3 and ephemeral anchors?\r\n\r\nNothing is really changing with v3 regardless. If we do this PR, *only* v3 transactions can be below minrelayfeerate and bumped through package CPFP. If we don't do this PR, v3 still has the same rules, it's just that below-minrelayfeerate is no longer exclusive to v3.",

You could probably merge that into the descendant feerate index, just by pretending the descendant fee rate is zero if both those conditions are true.",

      "body": "I think in the interests of moving the package relay and v3 project forward, it makes sense to adopt this approach and defer potential improvements like #27018 to the future. My thinking is that this PR is a conservative way forward that seems obviously safe; our eviction logic on the other hand has a number of shortcomings, which I think will be best to fix up first before making more changes to use the eviction logic in new scenarios. We can work on the mempool and eviction in parallel and (hopefully) once we have something that works better, we can revisit this limitation and see if we can lift it in the future.\r\n\r\nSo (re-?) concept ACK... Will try to give this a review again soon.",

      "body": "Last push fixes + tests the case where package meets mempool min feerate, but hits maxmempool and is evicted immediately (the user-facing effect is that submitpackage now throws a different and more helpful JSONRPCError). Don't know why I hadn't been testing that already, my bad.\r\n\r\n> I think \"submitpackage\" would count as obviously useful if it was available on mainnet -- even without package relay, a miner could expose that via a web form to allow people to do cpfp bumps when the (miner's) mempool is full, eg.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense to me as a useful use case, though I'm unsure if we should encourage miners to accept txns the rest of the network can't see.\r\n\r\n> I think with this PR merged, we could reasonably expose submitpackage outside of regtest, though should keep it debug-only/experimental (after this PR, I think it's never worse than having 500MB in the mempool and submitting a min mempool fee tx, and we already allow that).\r\n\r\nThought about this for a bit. While there are edge cases where the package won't go in, and submitpackage doesn't have a maxfeerate/maxburn check, I suppose this is not unsafe. Could open the RPC in a followup?",

Even without package relay, we can run into this problem if we are shrinking -maxmempool or raising -minrelaytxfee on a restart.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nWhen loading mempool.dat, use `bypass_limits=true` and then call `TrimToSize()` at the very end.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n- We definitely keep the \"highest descendant score\" transactions if mempool min feerate rises.\r\n- It's extremely simple implementation-wise.\r\n- It's simple to keep track of what made it in and what didn't.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n- If mempool.dat is very large, we can exceed maxmempool by quite a bit.\r\n- This won't be sufficient for ephemeral anchors (unless `bypass_limits` allows not-yet-spent anchors).\r\n",

Suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1510851570\r\n\r\nThis RPC should be safe but still experimental - interface may change, not all features (e.g. package RBF) are implemented, etc. If a miner wants to expose this to people, they can effectively use \"package relay\" before the p2p changes are implemented. However, please note **this is not package relay**; transactions submitted this way will not relay to other nodes if the feerates are below their mempool min fee. Users should put this behind some kind of rate limit or permissions.",

Rather than make judgment calls on what error is important(which is currently just return the \"first\"!), we simply return all errors and let the callers determine what's best.\r\n\r\nAdded a top level `package_msg` for quick eye-balling of general success of the package.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a couple bugs:\r\n\r\n1) Currently we don't actually broadcast a transaction, even if it was entered into our mempool, if a subsequent transaction causes `PKG_TX` failure. (I have a test for another branch that catches this, will adapt if concept ACK)\r\n2) \"other-wtxid\" is uncovered by tests, but IIUC was previously required to return \"fees\" and \"vsize\" results, but did not. I just make those results optional.",
