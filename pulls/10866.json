This paper describes Clang Thread Safety Analysis, a tool which uses annotations to declare and enforce thread safety policies in C and C++ programs.\r\n> […]\r\n> It has been deployed on a large scale at Google; all C++ code at Google is now compiled with thread safety analysis enabled by default.\r\n> […]\r\n> The GUARDED_BY attribute declares that a thread must lock `mu` before it can read or write to `balance`, thus ensuring that the increment and decrement operations are atomic. Similarly,\r\nREQUIRES declares that the calling thread must lock mu before calling `withdrawImpl`. Because the caller is assumed to have locked `mu,` it is safe to modify `balance` within the body of the method.",

Switching the primitives in the sync module from boost to std should be done in an atomic commit, without doing any other change.\r\n\r\nI didn't know about this pull request before opening issue #11166 (from which you referred me here), I'm pretty close to having that ready to open a pull request, (just changing boost to std). Will update here when it's ready. I think it'd be better if that were reviewed and merged, and only then follow up with other changes. \r\nEDIT: Opened pull request #11199 ",

Of course, you're welcome to use my own PR #11199 which does just the move from `boost` to `std` locks part.",

You can squash these changes into the \"Fix -Wthread-safety-analysis warnings\" commit, which should make it smaller.",
