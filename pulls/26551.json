This prevents a peer from being able to marginally delay another peer's transactions and also simplifies the internal API slightly. Because we're now associating orphan processing with the peer that provided the orphan originally, we no longer process orphans immediately after receiving the parent, but defer until a future call to `ProcessMessage`.\r\n\r\nBased on #26295 ",

(To run a node with just libbitcoinkernel and a minimal P2P stack to receive blocks)\r\n* The mempool is already treated optional in pretty much every other part of the codebase (validation, RPC, ...), so doing it consistently is preferable.\r\n* Removing the requirement of PeerManager to hold a reference to a mempool makes (unit/fuzz) testing easier if there is a test that doesn't need the mempool. Also, it makes the coupling of CTxMemPool and PeerManager a bit more loose.\r\n\r\nPicked up from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22850\r\n",

I think its current behaviour is technically not quite right? If we process a TX message in `ProcessMessage` now, we'll set `fMoreWork = true` only when `m_getdata_requests` has entries, but I think we should also be doing it if the peer's orphanage work queue isn't empty, as `ProcessMessage` may have added to it. I think this is technically a bug introduced in #15644 -- there should have been an `if (!pfrom->orphan_work_set.empty()) fMoreWork = true;`  added after the `ProcessMessage()` call, as well as after the `// this maintains the order of responses` comment.\r\n\r\nThe only result of the bug is that when a parent comes in, processing its orphaned children will be delayed by 100ms rather than occurring essentially immediately.",

Into a dedicated thread for orphan processing?\r\n\r\nNo, I was thinking a separate `ProcessOrphans` method like `ProcessMessages` and `SendMessages`.\r\n\r\n> Is this situation (that the peer who sent us an orphan is different from the peer that sent us the parent) typical? Otherwise might it be acceptable to just have a unnecessary 100ms wait if it occurs very rarely?\r\n\r\nOn a long running node, I'm seeing maybe a few hundred orphans being accepted during startup (ie, children whose parent txs were announced while my node was offline) but then perhaps only 20-60 accepted orphans per day. I don't have much of an idea how many of those would have a different node sending the parent compared to the child, but it doesn't seem likely to be a real problem.",
