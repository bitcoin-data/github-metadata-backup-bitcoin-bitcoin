    "body": "Adds support for binding and listening, as well as connecting to, scoped IPv6 addresses.\n\nI wanted to be able to use IPv6 link-local addresses on 4.2+ GNU/Linux (`sin6_scope_id` was added in 2.4). So, that's what I've tested. It seems to work. If I missed something, please let me know and I'll fix it.\nI haven't tried with Windows or Mac, but I think the support is present in many versions of those systems too.\nHopefully, this does not simply fail for the automated Windows build (fingers crossed).\nIPv6 scoped addresses are also known as link-local and site-local addresses.\nThe Linux docs say, \"Linux supports it [sin6_scope_id] only for link-local addresses\". Windows may support site-local addresses.\n\nNote that if you test this, it's easier to see the bound address with something like: `sudo netstat -pantu --wide | grep bitcoin`\nAlso, here's an example of an easy way to find nodes accessible on your local link: `ping6 -I eth0 -n ff02::1`\n\nBasically, commands similar to these should work now, instead of failing with `\"Unable to bind to [fe80::1234:5ff:fe67:89ab]:8333 on this computer (bind returned error Invalid argument (22))\"` or `\"socket send error Broken pipe (32)\"`:\n- `bitcoin-qt/bitcoind -listen -bind/-whitebind='[fe80::1234:5ff:fe67:89ab%eth0]:8333'`\n- `bitcoin-qt/bitcoind -connect='[fe80::1234:5ff:fe67:89ab%eth0]:8333'`\n\nThis should still fail due to missing the scope ID:\n- `bitcoin-qt/bitcoind -listen -bind/-whitebind='[fe80::1234:5ff:fe67:89ab]:8333'`\n\nThis should still fail due to the scope id being misplaced:\n- `bitcoin-qt/bitcoind -listen -bind/-whitebind='[fe80::1234:5ff:fe67:89ab]%eth0:8333'`\n\nReferences:\nhttp://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipv6.7.html\nhttp://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/msripv6/docs/config.htm\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms739166(v=vs.85).aspx\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ipv6-scope-api-00\n",

I only mentioned them because the Windows documents mentioned them and I'm inclined to think that we don't need to concern ourselves with them.

This only changes the minimum needed to get it to work.\n\nAlso, circling back on the site-local addresses...\nTheir original behavior has been deprecated for many years.\nI tested `fec0/10` and `fec0/64` addresses with Bitcoin Core 0.12.0, and it already binds them with no problem and does not treat them as local (it advertises them).\nThat existing behavior is in line with RFC guidance:\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.7\n\n```\n\"The special behavior of this prefix defined in [RFC3513] must no longer be supported in new implementations (i.e., new implementations must treat this prefix as Global Unicast).\"\n```\n\nThat's good. It means this PR only has to concern itself with link-local (which was the original intent).\n\nThe link-local `fe80/64` [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.6] addresses are treated as being local/non-routable/non-advertisable already.\nDiscovery of our own addresses does not add/include link-locals.\nAs stated before, `CNetAddr::IsRFC4862` matches link-locals and thus `CNetAddr::IsRoutable` returns false for them. This ultimately stops them from being advertised.\n\nThe motivation for this change is to make it easier to deploy and manage a cluster of nodes on a local network.\nFor example, I was spinning up multiple nodes on an adhoc WIFI network for a simulation and IPv6 link-local addressing made that process easier by a few steps for each node.\n",
