An additional assert/error could be added if we\r\n  wanted to restrict its usage beyond regtest, bit I don't think the\r\n  restriction makes sense. Remember that Params() now returns a const ref and init.cpp was the only context was the only context where UpdateRegtestBIP9Parameters was called from.\r\n- [X] post-C++11: s/boost::scoped_ptr/std::unique_ptr/ as in #8629\r\n- [X] Return a std::unique_ptr<CChainParams> directly instead of a CChainParams*\r\n- [X] testChainParams could be confused as meaning params from testnet (changed to chainParams)\r\n- [X] Changes to checkpoint tests no longer required after #9053 ",

          "body": "I think these are all the remaining Bitcoin Core v0.15 PRs in the wallet area that we don't have yet, and are useful to us.\r\nI've grouped them here since they are all pretty small, simple, and narrow-focused (on the wallet/rpcwallet files).\r\n\r\nThis changeset is based on top of\r\n- [x] #2337\r\n\r\nas it keeps going with the multiwallet implementation, adding:\r\n- RPC endpoint support\r\n- `listwallets` RPC\r\n- wallet name in `getwalletinfo` RPC\r\n- `wallet_multiwallet.py` functional test\r\n\r\nAs in some areas we are much closer to upstream, some of the commits needed adaptations (especially the functional tests). A couple of commits have been extended to include shield-related code.\r\n\r\nList of upstream PRs backported/adapted:\r\n\r\n- bitcoin#9906  : Disallow copy constructor CReserveKeys\r\n- bitcoin#9830  : Add safe flag to listunspent result\r\n- bitcoin#9993  : Initialize nRelockTime\r\n- bitcoin#10108 : ApproximateBestSubset should take inputs by reference, not value\r\n- bitcoin#10075 : Remove unused C++ code not covered by unit tests\r\n- bitcoin#10257 : Add test for getmemoryinfo\r\n- bitcoin#10295 : Move some WalletModel functions into CWallet\r\n- bitcoin#10500 : Avoid CWalletTx copies in GetAddressBalances and GetAddressGroupings\r\n- bitcoin#10522 : Remove unused variables\r\n- bitcoin#10816 : Properly forbid -salvagewallet and -zapwallettxes for multi wallet\r\n- bitcoin#10849 : Multiwallet: simplest endpoint support\r\n- bitcoin#9380  : Separate different uses of minimum fees (only dustRelayFee)\r\n- bitcoin#10817 : Redefine Dust and add a discard_rate (only first commit)\r\n- bitcoin#10883 : Rename -usewallet to -rpcwallet\r\n- bitcoin#10604 : Add listwallets RPC, include wallet name in getwalletinfo + tests\r\n- bitcoin#10893 : Avoid running multiwallet.py twice\r\n- bitcoin#10870 : Use wallet 0 in rpc console if running with multiple wallets\r\n- bitcoin#10931 : Fix misleading \"method not found\" multiwallet errors\r\n- bitcoin#10885 : Reject invalid wallets\r\n- bitcoin#11022 : Basic keypool topup\r\n- bitcoin#10976 : [MOVEONLY] Move some static functions out of wallet.h/cpp\r\n- bitcoin#11310 : Test listwallets RPC\r\n- bitcoin#10858 : \"errors\" to getblockchaininfo + unify \"errors\" field in get*info RPCs\r\n- bitcoin#11492 : Fix leak in CDB constructor\r\n- bitcoin#11476 : Avoid opening copied wallet databases simultaneously\r\n- bitcoin#11590 : always show help-line of wallet encryption calls\r\n- bitcoin#11289 : Add wallet backup text to import* and add* RPCs",
