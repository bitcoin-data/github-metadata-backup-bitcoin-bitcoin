    "body": "While working on some changes to coin selection in a separate branch, I noticed this test was failing. This is because the test expects exact values from `gettxoutsetinfo` to compare against, which relies on coin selection to be deterministic.\r\n\r\nIf coin selection is changed in any way, this test will fail and need to be updated with new values.\r\n\r\nInstead, we can make the test deterministic by filtering to a UTXO of a specific amount as our first input and then using `fundrawtransaction` to grab a second UTXO. This works because the remaining large UTXOs in the wallet are coinbase outputs. Creating a transaction in this way does not affect any of the logic in the test.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

Looking through the full test, it _seems_ like you could use `MiniWallet`, but it's definitely a bigger change than the few lines I did here. Selfishly, I'd prefer making the small change now to unblock myself on a bigger PR I'm working on for coin selection, and then come back to this one later and re-write it to use `MiniWallet` in a follow-up PR.",
