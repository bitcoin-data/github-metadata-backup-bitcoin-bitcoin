    "body": "**As of 14/03/2022 (chain tip hash : 00000000000000000000628002621832be9281faf72c394e66a8bc8446f80c75), this project is under implementation in separate process relying on the multiprocess framework. See https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/56 for more information on current state.**\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a new subsystem aiming towards providing a generic framework for integrating alternative transport communication channels inside Bitcoin Core. This PR is a functional proof-of-concept using LN transport protocol as a new link layer for header fetching. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18989 for high-level discussion and proposal merits.\r\n\r\n## The Design \r\n\r\nPrevious [work](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17376) has been attempted to increase network security and robustness by increasing communication redundancy. While being optional and fault-tolerant, these attempt don't scale well to integrate a wide-range of alternatives such as [domain-fronting](https://www.bamsoftware.com/papers/fronting/), [orbital communications](https://github.com/Blockstream/satellite), [amateur radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DASH7), [Tor pluggable transports](https://snowflake.torproject.org/), unlicensed UHF, Bluetooth, [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/), Lightning[ Noise transport](http://noiseprotocol.org/), ... Each of these transports has its own availability, latency, don't bind to the Berkeley sockets model, are unidirectional, require custom peer discovery, are not suited for block traffic, ...\r\n\r\nThis proposal tries to overcome these issues by laying out a generic \"driver\" framework with its own new processing stack, thereby encapsulating per-transport oddities. It introduces:\r\n\r\n* Per-transport capabilities (`TransportCapabilities`). Originally declared by each driver, they abstract driver specifities to general flags, like directionality, protocol messages scope. They could be extended with further attributes, like max bandwidth for adjusted packing or \"privacy\"/\"trustness\" niceness of the link.\r\n* Abstract driver model (`CDriver`). Basically, it dissociate driver warmup, message preprocessing, sending and reception. Ideally you would want to load them dynamically.\r\n* \"Anycast\" header-fetching (`AltLogicValidation::BlockHeaderAnomalie`). After notification from the [watchdog module](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18987), it sends a `GETHEADERS` message to any peers supporting bidirectionality and headers processing.\r\n* Alternative processing stack (`AltLogicValidation`). Relying on its own threads, it manages drivers and may take action based on static logical capabilites instead of peer state, reducing likelihood of bugs. In the future, one could implement a more robust headers-syncing strategy like reverse-header or compressed headers. It may also leverage a [future asynchronous validation interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18963).\r\n\r\nThere are many advantages of this kind of design --, it is easy to integrate new drivers binding to an abstract class, it is easy to reason about due to logical capabilities and at the same time provides granular tuning due to the fine-integration with rpc. Peer discovery and policy or bandwidth/memory DoS-protection are all possible driver add-ons as well. One could envision an rpc like `sendemergencytx`, broadcasting a transaction on any transport protocol available, like a [LN's justice transaction](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/05-onchain.md#revoked-transaction-close-handling) after detection of being eclipsed.\r\n\r\nThis module could be made entirely optional at compile-time with `--enable-altnet` even if such integration with the build system hasn't been made.\r\n\r\nObviously this is an exploratory PoC, I don't expect code here to be merged. Beyond worthiness of doing this in Rust there are a lot of open questions, including the threading/memory model, interface with existing codebase, build system, resources consumption and fault-tolerance. As next steps, I would favor building on the multiprocess work and hosting this new network stack in its own to avoid any bug contamination from introducing complex driver. I encourage those with opinions on the higher level motivation and design discussion to leave their ideas on the linked issue.\r\n\r\nHigh-level design:\r\n\r\n\r\n              ___________            ______________________\r\n             |           |          |                      |\r\n             | CWatchdog |----------|  AltLogicValidation  |\r\n             |___________|          |______________________|\r\n                                               |\r\n                                         ______|______\r\n                                        |             |\r\n                                        |  CAltstack  |                                                         \r\n                                        |_____________| \r\n                                               |\r\n                                           ____|____\r\n                                          |         |\r\n                                          | CDriver |\r\n                                          |_________|\r\n                                               |\r\n                                       ________|__________\r\n                                      |                  |\r\n                                      | ClightningDriver |\r\n                                      |__________________|\r\n                                      \r\n                                                   \r\n\r\n## The Demo\r\n\r\nThis PoC features a header-fetching round-trip, leveraging LN connection protocol. Each LN node connects to its peers through an encrypted and authenticated channel. Since your LN peer must have chain access, you could leverage this privileged link to create a redundant chain access.\r\n\r\nUsing C-lightning [custom LN message support](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/3315) and [plugin API](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/PLUGINS.md), we could embed directly inside `HEADERS`/`GETHEADERS` and realize a round-trip between 2 disconnected bitcoin nodes through their respective C-lightning nodes.\r\n\r\nFor this to work, you need to compile and run 2 C-lightning nodes,  each with its own data directory and launched with this [custom bridge plugin](https://github.com/ariard/bridge-layer). Once those LN nodes are running, activate bridges by `lightning-cli alice_on` and `lightning-cli bob_on`. The plugin doesn't seem to accept CLI argument so I had to hardcode some node addresses.\r\n\r\nThen compile 2 bitcoin nodes with this patchset. For one of them you must change the hardcoded port in C-lightning driver and deactivate the watchdog logic. Also, it would be best if you changed `SCAN_INTERVAL` to something reasonable, for instance 1 min.\r\n\r\nHigh-level setup:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 -->\r\n\r\n                    __________          LN_msg(`GETHEADERS`)                   ________\r\n                   |          |                                               |        |\r\n                   | CL-Alice |-----------------------------------------------| CL-Bob |\r\n                   |__________|                                               |________|           \r\n                        |               LN_msg(`HEADERS`)                         |\r\n                    ____|_____                                                 ___|_____\r\n                   |          |                 <--                           |         |\r\n                   |  bridge  |                                               | bridge  |\r\n                   |__________|                                               |_________|\r\n                        |                                                         |\r\n                    ____|_____                                                 ___|____\r\n                   |          |                                               |        |\r\n                   | BC-Alice |                                               | BC-Bob |\r\n                   |__________|                                               |________|\r\n\r\n                      HEIGHT                                                   HEIGH + 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning both nodes, they should automatically connect to the bridge, and after anomaly detection realize a header exchange, if one of them is at least one block forward (run `generatetoaddress 1 $ADDR`).\r\n\r\nOtherwise you may observe past logs:\r\n\r\nAlice:\r\n```\r\nÊ0-05-16T00:55:11Z Boostrapping Altstack\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z init message: Done loading\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z msghand thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z drivers-warmup thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z addcon thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Registered driver with 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z net thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z altstack-processing thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Clightning - Warmup\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z dnsseed thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z altstack-handle thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z 0 addresses found from DNS seeds\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z dnsseed thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Clightning - Bridge connection\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Registering node_id 0 with driver_id 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z drivers-warmup thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Block header anomalie detected - notifying subscribers\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Block header anomalie detected - Anycasting header fetching from 0f9188f13cb7b2c71f2a335e3a4fc328bf5beb436012afca590b1a11466e2206\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Clightning - Preprocessing getheader\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Cligthning - Bridge send success 71\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:19Z Cligtning - Bridge receive success\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:19Z Receive HEADERS from 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:19Z Receiver header 65084efeaffe9929de0a0bb747cf48ac7f9b4edb214b2d1ad2ea468977be8e1e vs tip 0f9188f13cb7b2c71f2a335e3a4fc328bf5beb436012afca590b1a11466e2206\r\n```\r\n\r\nBob:\r\n``` \r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Boostrapping Altstack\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z addcon thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z opencon thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z msghand thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z drivers-warmup thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Registered driver with 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Clightning - Warmup\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z init message: Done loading\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z dnsseed thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z altstack-processing thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z altstack-handle thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Clightning - Bridge connection\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Registering node_id 0 with driver_id 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z drivers-warmup thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:10Z Leaving InitialBlockDownload (latching to false)\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Cligtning - Bridge receive success\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Receive GETHEADERS from 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Fetch header starting from 0f9188f13cb7b2c71f2a335e3a4fc328bf5beb436012afca590b1a11466e2206, tip 65084efeaffe9929de0a0bb747cf48ac7f9b4edb214b2d1ad2ea468977be8e1e\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Sending back 1 headers\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Clightning - Preprocessing header\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Cligthning - Bridge send success 84\r\n2020-05-16T00:56:10Z Adding fixed seed nodes as DNS doesn't seem to be available.\r\n```",

Have you in mind other alternative which needs a really specific threading model ? That's a bit more complexity but you may allocate priority to avoid starvation.\r\n\r\nI agree that the `mapNodeState` isn't great and ideally you do want to defer every peer policy to the driver. Reducing state is less error-prone.\r\n\r\n@icota Do you have in mind a different ipv4/ipv6 flow that the one implemented by main net ? Path-aware routing could be cool and definitely something belonging there. ",

      "body": "Hello @ariard pluggable alternative transport systems for Bitcoin Core gets a concept ACK from me.\r\n\r\nI wonder if in the future this framework could include some transport prioritisation which might, for example, relay blocks over an internet/Tor connection but attempt to broadcast and relay transactions over Amateur radio/bluetooth (as available) with a new Tor circuit as a fallback, to further obscure a transactions origin.\r\n\r\nIn the case that your node might have a metered main connection e.g. 3G along with a secondary transport mechanism, the same prioritisation might be able to help split bandwidth required between multiple transports simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFor the low bandwidth/metered scenario, I feel this would be an excellent match for the compressed block headers scheme I picked up on in my email [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-May/017834.html).",

I will need some more time to have implementation comments, but will try to think about this in the context of the alt net I'm most familiar with (stateless unlicensed UHF Mesh / goTenna). Some preliminary big picture thoughts:\r\n\r\n 1) should the Watchdog functionality eventually be broken out as its own RFC? even without an altnet transport wouldn't a core wallet also want notification of unusual p2p events?\r\n\r\n 2) Right now core is aware of [ASN buckets](https://bitcoincore.reviews/16702.html), do think different altnet connections could be treated as diverse ASNs?\r\n 2a) Should altnet peers be treated as one ASN, or is there a way to ensure diversity to protect against sybil altnet peers.\r\n\r\n 3) Do you envision a plugin-driver model so that core would support the high level CDriver/Watchdog, but people could plug-in their own low-level implementations? \r\n 3a) In the case of goTenna, we have a low-level C driver that is not open source so would not be appropriate to include in core. Would something like the HWI system make sense for different vender specfic CDriver instances?\r\n\r\n 4) A deeper integration to make altnet peers 1st class peers would be difficult, but if a CNetAddr worked more like a URI then peers could be stored as ip:\\\\ipaddress:port and altnet nodes would look like clightning:\\\\peeraddr and use an altnet CDriver named `clightning`.\r\n 4a) A less invasive approach to 1st class would be that any altnet peer just uses 127.0.0.1:cdriver_port, but all peers can include user configurable transport capabilities.\r\n\r\nGreat work, I'm really excited to try this out.\r\n",

      "body": "Concept ACK, but I am wondering if some of this would be better off outside the Bitcoin Core build system. Obviously stuff that can be done with no additional requirements (additional requirements could be a proxy, another daemon or even new hardware like an antenna) and that is a clear benefit to Bitcoin Core can live inside of Bitcoin Core. For example something like the existing `TipMayBeStale` logic.\r\n\r\nHowever, for transports that would pull in additional dependencies, a more flexible approach would be to define a common interface. The drivers could then ask Bitcoin Core for raw validation data and statistics, then reply with new headers or blocks. For example, this could be done over the RPC interface. I haven't thought about all the trade-offs, but it seems beneficial if addons can be attached and removed during run-time as well as being developed independently of the Bitcoin Core development process?",

      "body": "Hi @willcl-ark,\r\n\r\n> I wonder if in the future this framework could include some transport prioritisation which might, for example, relay blocks over an internet/Tor connection but attempt to broadcast and relay transactions over Amateur radio/bluetooth (as available) with a new Tor circuit as a fallback, to further obscure a transactions origin.\r\n\r\nYes introducing drivers capabilities (`fHeaders`, `fTransaction`, ...) should be seen as primitives to label traffic according to application/user requirements. I can foresee `bitcoin-cli ioctl bluetooth --label=tx,headers`, you're envisioning something like this ?\r\n\r\n> In the case that your node might have a metered main connection e.g. 3G along with a secondary transport mechanism, the same prioritisation might be able to help split bandwidth required between multiple transports simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAh thanks didn't think about this, effectively when bandwidth has been consumed on one device you may want to fallback on another one. I do think bandwidth tracking should be done drivers-side.\r\n\r\n> For the low bandwidth/metered scenario, I feel this would be an excellent match for the compressed block headers scheme I picked up on in my email here.\r\n\r\nYes IIRC compressed block headers in the linked issue (#18989). Clearly that would be easier to innovate on message protocol, like also transaction compression.",

It could be used by any kind of application, including the wallet.\r\n\r\n> Right now core is aware of ASN buckets, do think different altnet connections could be treated as diverse ASNs?\r\n2a) Should altnet peers be treated as one ASN, or is there a way to ensure diversity to protect against sybil altnet peers.\r\n\r\nI would like to avoid dealing with ASN/IP address at all. If you assume wireless communications there is no ASN to deal with, peer discovery and policy should be inside the driver. With regards to peer, you may only need a general way to authenticate them, so maybe some driver method enumerating its hosted peers ?\r\n\r\n> Do you envision a plugin-driver model so that core would support the high level CDriver/Watchdog, but people could plug-in their own low-level implementations?\r\n3a) In the case of goTenna, we have a low-level C driver that is not open source so would not be appropriate to include in core. Would something like the HWI system make sense for different vender specfic CDriver instances?\r\n\r\nI clearly envision a plugin-driver model and exactly core would support the high-level `CDriver/`CWatchdog`/`AtLogicValidation`. I lean to something like HWI and drivers implementations being hosted outside of core, under bitcoin-core/ for the open-sources ones. With regards to proprietary, I don't have opinion, if they bind to the interface that's better for you I guess.\r\n\r\n> A deeper integration to make altnet peers 1st class peers would be difficult, but if a CNetAddr worked more like a URI then peers could be stored as ip:\\ipaddress:port and altnet nodes would look like clightning:\\peeraddr and use an altnet CDriver named clightning.\r\n4a) A less invasive approach to 1st class would be that any altnet peer just uses 127.0.0.1:cdriver_port, but all peers can include user configurable transport capabilities.\r\n\r\nI don't want to interfere with the actual p2p stack. But if what you want to address is user configurable transport capabilities that can be done at the rpc-level and yes something like `bitcoin-cli ioctl Wifi:XXX --label=tx,addr` ?\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!",

I don't think drivers should ask for raw validation data on their own, i.e you may receive your block from actual p2p but want to broadcast it over WiFi. Drivers acting on their own means you poll a lot for nothing due to block variance, and that's what RPC doesn't fit IMO. Haven't thought that much about run-time addition but I completely agree to not encumber Bitcoin Core development process more. You provide a generic framework and drivers devs can work on their own in another repo.",

We've never materially seen any real adoption of \"additional, on the side\" contrib things. Even opt-in configuration is rarely used, let alone something with additional setup requirements. I don't think this carries much value unless its targeting (eventually) being built-in (though not enabled) by default.",

Have you in mind other alternative which needs a really specific threading model ? That's a bit more complexity but you may allocate priority to avoid starvation.\r\n\r\nI don't know that the framework even needs to provide any kind of threading? Why not let the applications decide that. Using the net.h stuff like NetMsgType, CBlockLocator, NetMsgMaker and the connection types really limits the utility here. eg radio stuff probably wants to read/write from a tty, not a \"real socket\". Let alone something like DNS which doesn't even have a file descriptor, only a libc call to poll.",

But one thing that's missing and would be nice would be a plan for how this might be rolled out. I'm assuming we wouldn't add a new framework before anything was using it, and I know Matt has already implemented a lot of things that could use this framework. So it'd be great if there was a writeup (or outline like the [assumeutxo plan](https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/2019-04-proposal/proposal#plan)) saying what the steps could be for rolling this out, and linking to Matt's implementations, and saying how things could be integrated. The [dev wiki](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki) could be a good place to put this, since it would be speculative and subject to change.\r\n\r\nOn the PR itself, I know it is exploratory and you don't expect it to be merged, but was hard not to notice it was copying and pasting a lot of existing code from net/net_processing/validationinteface code and also introducing new code following older conventions (`CPrefixedClassNames` `bHungarianVariables`), so I just want to quickly encourage using the current [style](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#coding-style-c) in new code and trying to avoid duplicate implementations of things like [`WatchSignalsInstance`](https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/blob/3667d18a76f72acf0741a886715b6c9fee40001d/src/watchdoginterface.cpp#L14) / [`MainSignalsInstance`](https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/blob/3667d18a76f72acf0741a886715b6c9fee40001d/src/validationinterface.cpp#L26) in the real version of this.",

Let alone something like DNS which doesn't even have a file descriptor, only a libc call to poll.\r\n\r\nI think message translation from a wire format suiting communication channel should be done by the driver, it doesn't make sense at all to make it in the framework. So we may pass `NetMsgType` to the driver interface without caring further.\r\n\r\nWith regards to threading right, but isn't the case in main stack we have a separation between `ThreadSocketHandler` and `ThreadMessageHandler` for performance reasons ? We may follow there ?",

Note: I've been talking with folks actively working on alt-com like BlockSat. As first functional step , I plan to reuse the headers-over-DNS from Matt, it's pretty straightforward and can be used by anyone without further requirement.\r\n\r\n> On the PR itself, I know it is exploratory and you don't expect it to be merged, but was hard not to notice it was copying and pasting a lot of existing code from net/net_processing/validationinteface\r\n\r\nRight, it may make sense to refactor `MainSignalsInstance` to make it generic enough for reuse.",

      "body": "> Do you have in mind a different ipv4/ipv6 flow that the one implemented by main net ? Path-aware routing could be cool and definitely something belonging there.\r\n\r\nMy point is that rather than making a separate framework I would prefer to change `net` to support the functionality you are suggesting for AltNet. \r\n\r\nLook at what I am greeted with when I run `getnetworkinfo`:\r\n```\r\n\"networks\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"ipv4\",\r\n      \"limited\": false,\r\n      \"reachable\": true,\r\n      \"proxy\": \"\",\r\n      \"proxy_randomize_credentials\": false\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"ipv6\",\r\n      \"limited\": false,\r\n      \"reachable\": true,\r\n      \"proxy\": \"\",\r\n      \"proxy_randomize_credentials\": false\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"onion\",\r\n      \"limited\": true,\r\n      \"reachable\": false,\r\n      \"proxy\": \"\",\r\n      \"proxy_randomize_credentials\": false\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\nRight now this output is produced by iterating over a dumb enum but would it not be cool if you could plug a \"satellite\" or \"radio\" driver in there. \r\n\r\nThis approach to alternative transports seems very intuitive to me but I don't see the sentiment echoed by anyone else. I haven't dug deep so it makes me think it's either not a good idea to begin with and/or involves some very heavy lifting?\r\n\r\nHave you considered it?",

Ideally traffic assignement (\"this peer will do block-relay\") should be cross-stack",

It requires a some boilerplate to define a new [`src/interfaces/` class](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/52192725a3ec1f814cf40049de45efffc226cd5b/src/interfaces/echo.h#L14-L22) and [`interfaces::Init::make` method](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/52192725a3ec1f814cf40049de45efffc226cd5b/src/interfaces/init.h#L27), but after you do that it's easy to add methods to the interface, and make method calls from either process to the other with call forwarding and serialization and threading handled automatically. \r\n\r\nAdditionally with 01c31f9dcd15c1009c4b69e820fc0c01b73cd3c9 from the [Process Separation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Process-Separation) branch [ryanofsky@`ipc-export`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/ipc-export), bitcoin listens on a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` socket that other processes can connect to and call the same interfaces.",

      "body": "@ariard , no real issue with sockets and (as you write) it should better be ``bitcoin <-> node-Tor`` and not ``bitcoin -> node-Tor -> bitcoin`` (basic stdin/stdout), I was talking about unix sockets in my previous message (which I assimilated to unix pipe in terms of wording) and not inter unix processes pipes \r\n\r\nI would just modify ``bitcoin-node <-> bitcoin-altnet <-> tor-driver <-> node-tor`` by ``bitcoin <-> node-Tor (via altnet)`` where node-Tor implements IPC or (better) ``bitcoin-node <-> altnet nodejs-driver <-> node-tor``, so nodejs modules don't have to implement unix sockets\r\n\r\nWhere ``node-js-driver`` is something like:\r\n\r\n\taltnet.on(‘data’,//process data from unix socket)\r\n\taltnet.send=//send data to unix socket\r\n\t\r\nThen nodejs programs would just import altnet and turn it into the required object (a [Duplex Object](https://github.com/Ayms/node-Tor/blob/master/docs/README.md#the-duplex-object-and-evented-pipes) for node-Tor), two lines of code and that's it (unfortunately as mentioned above this does not work very well with some existing examples (ipfs), but for me this is a misdesign of ipfs that should not be reproduced)\r\n\r\nIndeed, in @icota example \"networks\" could be turned into \"layers\" and probably a good idea would be to be able to pipe between altnet layers when applicable (``bitcoin-node <-> altnet some driver <-> my_super_encryption <-> altnet nodejs-driver <-> node-tor``, it looks similar to what @icota proposes ``core ---> relay process ---> (some sort of alternative transport) ---> relay ---> other core``\r\n\r\nNo invention here, this is what unix does since the beginning of times, and similar to #9979 attempt, probably some code already exists to do this (ie easily plug layers from one techno/process to another)\r\n\t\r\n@ryanofsky , thanks for all the links, I will look at it in more details when I need it but it still looks a bit complicate, for simple testing, is there a simple way (modif in the bitcoin core code) to redirect/listen the bitcoin protocol via stdin/stdout?",

      "body": "> @ryanofsky , thanks for all the links, I will look at it in more details when I need it but it still looks a bit complicate, for simple testing, is there a simple way (modif in the bitcoin core code) to redirect/listen the bitcoin protocol via stdin/stdout?\r\n\r\nWith #10102 you could start unmodified bitcoin-node or bitcoin-wallet binaries via [socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/) if you wanted to control them with the ipc protocol over stdin/stdout:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsocat - system:\"src/bitcoin-node -ipcfd 4\",fdin=4,fdout=4\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could actually tweak the multiprocess spawning code to communicate over stdin/stdout instead of a separate socketpair descriptor, so you wouldn't need socat. But one reason the implementation avoids stdin/stdout is that it makes printf debugging awkward, and one stray printf or `-printtoconsole` anywhere in the codebase messes up the IPC connection.\r\n\r\nAlso as mentioned https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18988#issuecomment-642731876, with [01c31f9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/01c31f9dcd15c1009c4b69e820fc0c01b73cd3c9) from branch [ryanofsky@`ipc-export`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/ipc-export), you can connect to an already running `bitcoin-node` through a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` socket, which is probably what you would want to do as an external application, rather than starting a bitcoin process.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you're trying to do though, since I'm not really sure what information's relevant here.",

To do this, no `bitcoind` changes should be needed and node-Tor should just need to support simple subsets of the tor control and socks5 protocols (if it doesn't already). To avoid the need to use plumbing tools like socat, or to modify bitcoind, it would probably be easiest to just start with plain tcp sockets instead of unix sockets or stdin/stdout.\r\n\r\nAfter this worked, I'd start looking into more changes to streamline and package the functionality better:\r\n\r\n1. Changing -onion and -listenonion to support unix sockets or pipes instead of tcp\r\n2. Using #18988 (this PR) to write a new altnet driver that can speak socks5/torcontrol to node-Tor. No need to mess with #19160 (multiprocess pr) if the altnet driver is written in c++ or can be part of bitcoin core, but you might use #19160 if you want to write the altnet driver in a different language or more independently of the bitcoin core codebase.\r\n3. Maybe switch from socks5/torcontrol to a custom protocol for bitcoind <--> node-Tor communication. If socks5/torcontrol don't fit well into the altnet framework, maybe do this at the same time as writing the altnet driver.",
