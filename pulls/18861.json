    "body": "This PR intends to improve transaction-origin privacy.\r\n\r\nIn general, we should try to not leak information about what transactions we have (recently) learned about before deciding to announce them to our peers. There is a controlled transaction dissemination process that reveals our transactions to peers that has various safeguards for privacy (it's rate-limited, delayed & batched, deterministically sorted, ...), and ideally there is no way to test which transactions we have before that controlled process reveals them. The handling of the `mempool` BIP35 message has protections in this regard as well, as it would be an obvious way to bypass these protections (handled asynchronously after a delay, also deterministically sorted).\r\n\r\nHowever, currently, if we receive a GETDATA for a transaction that we have not yet announced to the requester, we will still respond to it if it was announced to *some* other peer already (because it needs to be in `mapRelay`, which only happens on the first announcement). This is a slight privacy leak.\r\n\r\nThankfully, this seems easy to solve: `setInventontoryTxToSend` keeps track of the txids we have yet to announce to a peer - which almost(*) exactly corresponds to the transactions we know of that we haven't revealed to that peer. By checking whether a txid is in that set before responding to a GETDATA, we can filter these out.\r\n\r\n(*) Locally resubmitted or rebroadcasted transactions may end up in setInventoryTxToSend while the peer already knows we have them, which could result in us incorrectly claiming we don't have such transactions if coincidentally requested right after we schedule reannouncing them, but before they're actually INVed. This is made even harder by the fact that filterInventoryKnown will generally keep known reannouncements out of setInventoryTxToSend unless it overflows (which needs 50000 INVs in either direction before it happens).\r\n\r\nThe condition for responding now becomes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  (not in setInventoryTxToSend) AND\r\n  (\r\n    (in relay map) OR\r\n    (\r\n      (in mempool) AND\r\n      (old enough that it could have expired from relay map) AND\r\n      (older than our last getmempool response)\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n```",

I agree with @amitiuttarwar that the PR description is confusing (you switch the perspective of 'we' being the node sending the GETDATA and 'we' being the node receiving it). PR descriptions end up in the merge commit, so it'd be good to fix that up.\r\n\r\nI think that rather than adding another bool to the already complex `ProcessGetData` which only exists to skip over a code block, it'd be clearer to refactor the getdata tx processing into its own function. That turns your change into a two line fix.\r\n\r\nI've done that here: https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/pr18861.1. Feel free to use it if you think it's useful.\r\n\r\n(The function signature for `ProcessGetTransactionData()` isn't great, and I'd prefer to send individual NOTFOUND messages within that function instead of batching them, but that's no longer a pure refactor and could be done later.)",

      "body": "(apologies that this conversation has wandered off-topic for the fix in this PR)\r\n\r\n> It would be unfortunate to make the protocol implementation less efficient just because it results in slightly cleaner code.\r\n\r\nLet me turn that around, and say \"it would be unfortunate to make less clean code, in order to make the wire protocol infinitesimally more efficient.\"\r\n\r\nRemember that the notfound path is the rare, failure case. How rare? Here are some stats from my node's first two peers:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> bcli getpeerinfo\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": 0,\r\n    [...]\r\n    \"bytessent_per_msg\": {\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"notfound\": 122,\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"tx\": 212229,\r\n    },\r\n    \"bytesrecv_per_msg\": {\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"notfound\": 427,\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"tx\": 31755274,\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": 1,\r\n    [...]\r\n    \"bytessent_per_msg\": {\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"notfound\": 1098,\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"tx\": 108708,\r\n    },\r\n    \"bytesrecv_per_msg\": {\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"notfound\": 926,\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"tx\": 93436726,\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlmost all notfound messages are 61 bytes (24 bytes header + 37 bytes data). Let's assume that an average tx message is 250 bytes for header+data.\r\n\r\nThat means for my first two peers I sent/received ~42 notfound messages and sent/received ~500,000 tx messages.\r\n\r\nLooking through my debug logs, the vast majority of notfound messages are 37 bytes, indicating a single item. So, for almost all calls of ProcessGetData(), there are zero or one notfound items, and batching has no effect on wire efficiency. Batching notfounds would save <100 messages per day for me (run `grep \"sending notfound\" .bitcoin/debug.log | grep -v \"37 bytes\"` to see for yourself).\r\n\r\nIn the adversarial case, it's more expensive for us to serve transactions than notfounds, so being more efficient doesn't protect us from any attacks.\r\n\r\nSending notfounds individually also has the nice effect of making getdata responses serial in the order we received them.\r\n\r\n> How about [...] a helper function [...] that just returns true or false\r\n\r\nI think that's better than the status quo, but I prefer delgating out to a function to do all the transaction GETDATA processing and message sending, so that it matches the responsibilities of ProcessGetBlockData() exactly.",

I can't wait to get rid of `mapRelay`! )\r\n- checked all the code paths of how a transaction could end up on `setInventoryTxToSend` \r\n- thought through possible unexpected cases that would lead to us incorrectly claiming we don't have the transaction. agree that the likelihood is minuscule & don't think the consequence would be dramatically negative, so the benefit far outweighs. \r\n- nice PR description :) \r\n\r\nthanks!

      "body": "Good find, @naumenkogs.\r\n\r\nMy thinking is that the best solution is actually introducing a separate rolling bloom filter (like `filterInventoryKnown`) for just outgoing announcements. It can be much smaller (we control the rate we announce things at, so given a limit of say 15 minutes to respond, there is an upper bound on the size), and then *only* permit GETDATA'ing things in that filter. I believe that can replace the setInventoryTxToSend test introduced here (while solving @luke-jr's concern above). It would also make me more comfortable with dropping `mapRelay` (after fixing the rescheduling of downloads after a NOTFOUND).\r\n\r\nI think the changes here are still an improvement, so I suggest going ahead with this if reviewers agree, and work on the above as a follow-up.",

The entries in setInventoryTxToSend are filtered by filterInventoryKnown, so it won't contain anything we know the other party already knows about. Of course, that filter is limited in size, but with 50000 entries I believe it can't expire entries faster than after 47 minutes (50000 invs / 35 (invs / msg) * (2s / msg) = 2857s), long after the entries are gone from the relay map (from which they expire after 15 minutes).\r\n\r\nIn other words: this is worrying about the situation where (a) you announced an INV (b) at least 47 minutes passed, during which you respond to a BIP35 mempool request from the peer (c) you try to rebroadcast (d) in the few seconds after the rebroadcast is scheduled but before it's sent out, you receive a GETDATA.",

I suspect its a product of development over time & is now redundant, but want to confirm my understanding.\r\n\r\n`LOCKS_EXCLUDED` enables clang to do static analysis when we compile with the `-Wthread-safety` option. Does the travis build that says `sanitizers: thread (TSan)` run with this option? \r\n\r\nI was trying to understand the limitations of the clang analysis. All I found was a lack of [negative capabilities](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#negative) (aka can't check if a function doesn't have the excluded annotation), which doesn't seem relevant here. \r\n\r\nAnd then `AssertLockNotHeld()` looks like our custom logic that would do runtime assertions. \r\n\r\nFrom a kind-of-clumsy search through git history, it looks like `AssertLockNotHeld` was added to `ProcessGetData` before the `LOCKS_EXCLUDED` annotation was. But it looks like `threadsafety.h` has defined `LOCKS_EXCLUDED` since 2014. So I can't color the context of decisions.\r\n\r\nTo bring this back to this PR, my fundamental question is: what is the difference of guarantees between `LOCKS_EXCLUDED` and `AssertLockNotHeld`? Would there be a reason to add the second check as well? ",

The lock expectations have been made very apparent and if new code tried to call this function with the lock acquired, I think we'd catch it in the review process. But on the other hand if we have tooling that reduces dependency on careful review, might as well use it? \r\n\r\nI'm about ready to ACK this PR, just would like to make sure my understanding is clear",
