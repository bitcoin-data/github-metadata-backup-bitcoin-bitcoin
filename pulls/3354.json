    "body": "Submitting this in the hopes somebody might pick it up and run with it (see the TODO list at end):\n\nInstead of dropping double-spent transactions, relay them to peers. Why? To make it easier for merchants to quickly detect attempted fraud for low-value, in-person purchases.\n\nA bloom filter is used so that only the first double-spend is relayed, to prevent an attacker from mounting a network denial-of-service attack by flooding it with double-spends of a transaction output they control.\n\nPeter Todd pointed out a possible try-to-DoS-network-bandwidth attack that this enables that works like this:\n\n1) Attacker starts with an unspent transaction input.\n2) Attacker sends a small-in-size first spend with a small fee.\n3) Attacker double-spends the transaction input with a very large (e.g. 100K) transaction with a large fee.\n\nSince miners will mine the first, small transaction (it might even pay a higher fee-per-kilobyte, but pay lower overall fee), an attacker can waste network bandwidth for a low cost.  Whether or not attackers will actually do this isn't clear, they don't directly gain anything by wasting network bandwidth.\n\nThe right solution to that possible DoS attack is for nodes to have a bandwidth budget for 'tx' messages, and start dropping messages (perhaps starting with the largest double-spends) if that budget is exceeded.\n\nOther things on the TODO:\n\n1) Bitcoin-Qt should warn the user if a zero-confirmation transaction is double-spent, and should have a notion of \"dead\" transactions (another spend made it into a block). NOTE: I found it is easy to create double spends running three local nodes in -regtest mode, and the raw transactions API (create/sign a pair of double-spending transactions, then sendrawtransaction them from two nodes at the same time).\n\n2) The RPC calls that give transaction information should report (somehow) double-spend attempts and \"dead\" transactions.\n\n3) Write up a test plan for all of the above.\n",

          "body": "One issue I see over and over is new users worrying about their transactions not getting confirmed after a few hours/days due to a low transaction fee. They typically panic a little and wonder if they lost their bitcoin or wonder when it will safe to send a new transaction again. Bitcointalk.org and /r/bitcoin are full of those posts.\n\nThis could be solved by having a \"Resend with higher transaction fee\" option in bitcoin wallets. This option would simply create a new transaction identical to the previous one but where the user could chose to assign a higher fee.\n\nThis could be implemented by adding new TXIN(s)/TXOUT (change address) to the transaction without changing anything else. Of course, this option would only be available when the wallet has spendable outputs that were not spent by the original transaction.\n\nOne problem with this solution is that even if a bitcoin wallet wanted to implement it, the second transaction would be detected as a double spend and would not be relayed by the network.\n\nWould it be possible to have smarter double spend detection where a transaction wouldn't be considered as a double spend if it sends the same amounts to the same TXOUTs as the original (in other words, if it is a superset of the original transaction)? \n\nAlso, any thoughts on the proposed solution?\n\nRelated: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/615\n",

Only the first respend seen is relayed.\n\nI successfully completed a primary test running 3 copies of bitcoin-qt in regtest mode with this patch applied, connected in a **node1-newtorknode-node2** configuration.\n\nI used the rawtransaction API for steps 2 and 3, but with -salvagewallet and a single funding transaction, tests would be possible that did not require rawtransactions.\n\nStill TODO: Regression test plan\n\nPrimary Test Details\nStep 1\n- Send transaction from node1 to a node2 address\n- \\* Transaction **is relayed** through networknode, to node2\n- \\* Transaction appears in node2 wallet\n\nStep 2\n- Restart node1 with -salvagewallet (so it forgets about 1st spend)\n- Send new transaction using same input (first double-spend), using rawtransaction API\n- \\* Transaction **is relayed** through networknode, to node2\n- \\* node2 does not accept the double-spend into its mempool and it does not appear in node2 wallet\n\nStep 3\n- Restart node1 with -salvagewallet again\n- Send transaction using same input (second double spend), using rawtransaction API\n- \\* Transaction **is not relayed** through networknode\n\nStep 4\nOne more test for good measure\n- Restart node1 with -salvagewallet again\n- Using regular UI (not rawtransaction API), send entire wallet balance to node2 (third double spend).

And I really don't think we want every PoS vendor in the world trying to connect to thousands of nodes...\n\nOf course the customer could Finney attack the store, but if we're talking about a low-value purchases then that is almost certainly a risk the store can profitably take.\n",

      "body": "@sipa Not likely to do any good, as malicious double-spends will just spend a single input. Of course, that leads to the next step of \"why don't we just provide the signature and prove two signatures were signed for the same scriptPubKey\" which then makes address re-use of any kind ever rather problematic, to say the least. Conveniently SHA256 midstates are no use here either, as the important bits - the COutPoints - are at the very start of a transaction.\n\nSpeaking of, if you're ever in a situation where transactions have to be re-issued false positives are a problem, e.g. bumping fees because your transaction won't mine and expired out of the mempool. Or for that matter if you ever participate in a ANYONECANPAY crowd-fund thing that fails. And then of course there's CoinJoin...\n\n@gmaxwell Another good one is how do you handle floating fees? Do you relay the double-spend even though you wouldn't relay the transaction? Because if you don't, then it acts like a IsStandard() rule split and you can do things like relay a particularly low-fee tx first, let it propagate so some of the network, then relay the high-fee version and let it propagate to your target. Of course, then there's the issue that every time we change IsStandard() the double-spend relay stops working reliably. (to the extent it ever worked at all) It interacts badly with out-of-band miner payments too: suppose I have a zero-fee tx and get some miner OOB to mine it. The rest of the network won't see my tx, which lets me broadcast the fee-paying version. Meanwhile even if the miner is \"honest\" the best they can do is tell their peers about the double-spend, and those peers will just ignore it because it has no fee attached and they wouldn't accept it to their mempool.\n",
