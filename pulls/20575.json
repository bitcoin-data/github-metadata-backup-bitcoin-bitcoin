Let me know if we want such a linter: I'd be happy to write one if we have a consensus Concept ACK on that.\r\n\r\n> How did you find them?\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon these when reading static analyzer logs in search for more severe issues. Static analysers typically flag assertions with side effects.

Let me know if we want such a linter: I'd be happy to write one if we have a consensus Concept ACK on that.\r\n\r\nMaybe—@sipa's find shows that at least a trivial linter could be easily confused.\r\n\r\n> An alternative (and shorter patch) would be to use Assert, whose expression is always evaluated, even if for some unexplainable reason NDEBUG is set.\r\n\r\nThis seems like the best long-term strategy to me. Move to our own assert function that is always evaluated, then forbid (using a trivial linter) use of built-in assert.\r\n\r\nCode review ACK 5021810650afc3073c2af6953ff046ad4d27a1fc",
