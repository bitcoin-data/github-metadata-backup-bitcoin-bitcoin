    "body": "This is a cleaner and simpler alternative to #25098. Inspired by [this conversation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27737#issuecomment-1562543301). The diff is large but the change itself is quite small.\r\n\r\nFixes builds with llvm >= 11 in guix by working around the problem. As a bonus, this is much cleaner and more maintainable than what we had before.\r\n\r\nSee the updated comment for more info. At a high level: rather than playing tricks and trying to work around clang's default includes, disable them and re-add what we want.",

That is _purely_ accidental and coincidental, as the addition of `-nostdlibinc` is what's _intended_ to make the other changes here work.\r\n\r\nBy sheer luck though, they manage to put everything in the correct order such that the poisoned paths come last in the search-order. That feels brittle, but maybe good enough.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to see what the consequences of the `argument unused during compilation` warning are as it'll be quite a while until we're using clang 17. If it turns out to only be a problem with our `-Werror` build, we can probably just hack around it. But I suspect that some libs in depends may be degraded due to failing configure checks. Will have a look.",

      "body": "> I'd also like to see what the consequences of the `argument unused during compilation` warning are as it'll be quite a while until we're using clang 17. If it turns out to only be a problem with our `-Werror` build, we can probably just hack around it. But I suspect that some libs in depends may be degraded due to failing configure checks. Will have a look.\r\n\r\nI tested this in detail today. I [minimally patched clang-12](https://github.com/theuni/llvm-project/commit/8624c391811197a137c990773690149e09c87a3f) and built from depends with and without the patch. I've verified that at least bitcoind, bitcoiin-qt, and univalue/test/object (one of the c-i offenders) are all identical.\r\n\r\nconfig.log shows a few differences which boil down to:\r\n```diff\r\n-ax_cv_PTHREAD_CLANG_NO_WARN_FLAG=-Qunused-arguments\r\n+ax_cv_PTHREAD_CLANG_NO_WARN_FLAG=no\r\n```\r\nBecause a few tests are thrown off by the warning.\r\n\r\nAnd the end-result is:\r\n```diff\r\n-PTHREAD_CFLAGS='-Qunused-arguments -pthread'\r\n+PTHREAD_CFLAGS='-pthread'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo.. only cosmetic, and nothing that changes the final binaries.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI propose that we take this commit as-is, with one on top to keep c-i from failing for this particular warning. So we just need to stick a `-Wno-error,-Wunused-command-line-argument` somewhere.\r\n\r\nI think that makes sense because eventually (once clang17+ becomes the norm) everything will work perfectly, and before then there may just be a few harmless warnings.\r\n\r\n@fanquake Thoughts? If you agree, where's the best place to disable the Werror?",
