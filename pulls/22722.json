    "body": "This PR is in response to the issue [#19699](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19699).\r\n\r\nBased on the discussion in the comments of PR [#22673](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22673) changes have been made in the `estimatesmartfee` itself such that it takes into account `mempoolMinFee` and `relayMinFee` . Hence it provides a fee estimate that is most likely to be paid by the user in an actual transaction, preventing issues such as [#16072](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16072).\r\n\r\nThe test file test/functional/feature_fee_estimation.py has also been updated to check this functionality.",

Maybe we could have a wrapper to `CBlockPolicyEstimator`'s `estimateSmartFee` in `CTxMemPool` that would return the max of `minerPolicyEstimator->estimateSmartFee()` and `GetMinFee`? This way the node interface would call this wrapper instead of the estimator's one and it would apply this behaviour to all the current call sites.",

We could do something similar in follow up to improve `estimatesmartfee`. However, I also wanted to share that results for `estimatesmartfee` even after this PR are not helpful or misleading in some cases. \r\n\r\nFor example: In first case mempool has some transactions with fee rate ranging from 1 to 100 sat/vB (less than 2MvB), estimatesmartfee should suggest fee rate close to 1 sat/vB for conf_target 2. It shows 20x what we actually need minimum at that moment.",

So the test would be more robust against future changes than the previous one in which I set it directly to \"0.0003\". \r\nI have incorporated most of the suggestions I got, and some of them, I would take up as follow-up in the future.\r\nBut for now, do suggest if any other change is required in the current PR.",
