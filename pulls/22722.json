    "body": "This PR is in response to the issue [#19699](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19699).\r\n\r\nBased on the discussion in the comments of PR [#22673](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22673) changes have been made in the `estimatesmartfee` itself such that it takes into account `mempoolMinFee` and `relayMinFee` . Hence it provides a fee estimate that is most likely to be paid by the user in an actual transaction, preventing issues such as [#16072](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16072).\r\n\r\nThe test file test/functional/feature_fee_estimation.py has also been updated to check this functionality.",

Maybe we could have a wrapper to `CBlockPolicyEstimator`'s `estimateSmartFee` in `CTxMemPool` that would return the max of `minerPolicyEstimator->estimateSmartFee()` and `GetMinFee`? This way the node interface would call this wrapper instead of the estimator's one and it would apply this behaviour to all the current call sites.",

We could do something similar in follow up to improve `estimatesmartfee`. However, I also wanted to share that results for `estimatesmartfee` even after this PR are not helpful or misleading in some cases. \r\n\r\nFor example: In first case mempool has some transactions with fee rate ranging from 1 to 100 sat/vB (less than 2MvB), estimatesmartfee should suggest fee rate close to 1 sat/vB for conf_target 2. It shows 20x what we actually need minimum at that moment.",

Hence it provides a fee estimate that is most likely to be paid by the user in an actual transaction, preventing issues such as [#16072](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16072).\r\n\r\nIt takes Confirmation Target (in blocks) and fee estimate mode as input and returns the expected fee rate, reason for estimation, and the block number at which estimate was found (only when the reason is estimatesmartfee) as output.\r\n\r\nTest for this function has been added in `test/functional/feature_fee_estimation.py`",

          "body": "The block policy estimator currently assumes that a miner is incentivized to include a transaction only by its own fee. That is if a tracked transaction `A` with a feerate of `1sat/vb` is confirmed because it was CPFP'd by a child transaction `B` with a feerate of `20sat/vb` it will happily fill its 1ksat/kvb bucket with a success confirmation. Note that `B` isn't tracked as it has in-mempool ancestors.\r\n\r\nThis is concerning as it would not only miss part of the data necessary to provide a correct (higher) estimate (as it's the case for RBF, cf  #22539) but it would wrongly assume an incorrect (lower) estimate was right. It is even more concerning if we take into account that estimating a too low fee could have security implications for protocols requiring timely confirmation of transactions.\r\n\r\nOf course, the estimation would only get worse as CPFP is increasingly used on the network. But it *is* actively used currently [0] on the network, many applications allow for this functionality directly [1] or indirectly [2]. And with the increasing usage of L2s such as the Lightning Network, we can expect the CPFP usage to increase even more as [fee bumping methods get more common](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/688). Interestingly, with the current estimator the more anchor output-based fee bumping (shifting the fees from the parent to a child transaction) are used on the network the less the estimation will be reliable for everyone.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a naive implementation for accounting for child transaction(s) feerates when a parent transaction gets confirmed in `CBlockPolicyEstimator`'s `processBlock`. It would fail to split the feerate if multiple parents share the same child and assign the whole package (but the other parent(s)) feerate to the first seen parent. Accurate tracking would introduce way more complexity.\r\n\r\n[0] TODO: Provide some raw data about historical usage of CPFP\r\n\r\n[1] For instance Bluewallet, LND, Mycelium and SparrowWallet do. And Lightning implems recommend to do a CPFP if the funding transaction doesn't confirm in a timely manner until we have [an upgrade of the funding protocol allow for RBF](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/851). \r\n\r\n[2] For lots of wallets include the Bitcoin Core one during a fee spike users continue to transact using unconfirmed UTxOs with transactions of increasing feerate (and even sometimes open an issue because they hit the descendants limit).",

          "body": "So I was fiddling with feerates today. I bumped into https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13283, but this seemed different.\r\n\r\nI have the following setup:\r\n- `-regtest` and `-minrelaytxfee=0.00001100` \r\n- one node makes a block every some seconds\r\n- other node has `-mintxfee=0.00001100` as well and connects to that node and creates a tx with createraw+fundraw+signraw+sendraw\r\n\r\nOn fundraw, I use `\"{\\\"feeRate\\\": 0.00001100}\"`.\r\n\r\nResult: the txs of the second node don't get relayed to the first node and don't get mined.\r\n\r\nSo my main reason for this research was to observe fee estimation. After a while, `estimatesmartfee 3` gives a feerate of `0.00001097`, which is just below the feeRate supposedly set in every txs in the blockchain & mempool (which seems weird on itself), but is also lower than the `minRelayTxFee` for that node.",
