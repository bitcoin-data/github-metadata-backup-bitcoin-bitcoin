    "body": "When an encrypted wallet is locked (for instance via the RPC `walletlock`), the documentation indicates that the key is removed from memory:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b92d609fb25637ccda000e182da854d4b762eee9/src/wallet/rpc/encrypt.cpp#L157-L158\r\n\r\nHowever, the vector (a `std::vector<unsigned char, secure_allocator<unsigned char>>`) is merely _cleared_. As it is a member variable, it also stays in scope as long as the wallet is loaded, preventing the secure allocator from deallocating. This allows the key to persist indefinitely in memory. I confirmed this behavior on my macOS machine by using an open-source third party memory inspector (\"Bit Slicer\"). I was able to find my wallet's master key in Bit Slicer after unlocking and re-locking my encrypted wallet. I then confirmed the key data was at the address in LLDB.  \r\n\r\nThis PR manually fills the bytes with zeroes before calling `clear()` by using our `memory_cleanse` function, which is designed to prevent the compiler from optimizing it away. I confirmed that it does remove the data from memory on my machine upon locking.\r\n\r\nNote: An alternative approach could be to call `vMasterKey.shrink_to_fit()` after the `clear()`, which would trigger the secure allocator's deallocation. However, `shrink_to_fit()` is not _guaranteed_ to actually change the vector's capacity, so I think it's unwise to rely on it.\r\n\r\n## Edit: A little more clarity on why this is an improvement. \r\n\r\nSince `mlock`ed memory is guaranteed not to be swapped to disk and our threat model doesn't consider a super-user monitoring the memory in realtime, why is this an improvement? Most importantly, consider hibernation. Even `mlock`ed memory may get written to disk. From the `mlock` [manpage](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html):\r\n\r\n> (But be aware that the suspend mode on laptops and some desktop computers will save a copy of the system's RAM to disk, regardless of memory locks.)\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this is true of [Windows](https://web.archive.org/web/20190127110059/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140207-00/?p=1833#:~:text=%5BThere%20does%20not%20appear%20to%20be%20any%20guarantee%20that%20the%20memory%20won%27t%20be%20written%20to%20disk%20while%20locked.%20As%20you%20noted%2C%20the%20machine%20may%20be%20hibernated%2C%20or%20it%20may%20be%20running%20in%20a%20VM%20that%20gets%20snapshotted.%20%2DRaymond%5D) and macOS as well. \r\n\r\nTherefore, a user with a strong OS password and a strong wallet passphrase could still have their keys stolen if a thief takes their (hibernated) machine and reads the permanent storage.
