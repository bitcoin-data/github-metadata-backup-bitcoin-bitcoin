    "body": "The `PopulateAndValidateSnapshot` function introduced in f6e2da5fb7c6406c37612c838c998078ea8d2252 from #19806 has been setting fake `nTx` and `nChainTx` values that can show up in RPC results (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29328) and make `CBlockIndex` state hard to reason about, because it is difficult to know whether the values are real or fake.\r\n\r\nRevert to previous behavior of setting `nTx` and `nChainTx` to 0 when the values are unknown, instead of faking them. Also drop no-longer needed `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID` flag.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an assert failure in the `(pindex->nChainTx == pindex->nTx + prev_chain_tx)` check that would previously happen if a snapshot was loaded, and a block was submitted which forked from the chain before the snapshot block and after the last downloaded background chain block. This block would not be marked assumed-valid because it would not be an ancestor of the snapshot, and it would have `nTx` set, `nChainTx` set to a nonsense value based on a sum with the previous block's fake value, and `prev->nChainTx` set with a real value, so the assert would fail. After this commit, `nChainTx` is unset instead of being set to a fake value, so the assert succeeds. A test which submits a block like this and previously crashed the node has been added in feature_assumeutxo.py. It was written and posted by maflcko in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29261#issuecomment-1918947945 \r\n\r\nCompatibility note: This change could result in `-checkblockindex` failures if a snapshot was loaded by a previous version of Bitcoin Core and not fully validated, because fake `nTx` values will have been saved to the block index. It would be pretty easy to avoid these failures by adding some compatibility code to `LoadBlockIndex` and changing `nTx` values from 1 to 0 when they are fake (when `(pindex->nStatus & BLOCK_VALID_MASK) < BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS`), but a little simpler not to worry about being compatible in this case.",

      "body": "> Not sure. This can only happen on test-chains, so I think it would be cleaner to just require the developers, if there are any, to finish their background sync, or to wipe their chainstate, or the blocksdir, or the whole test data dir.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense that having backwards compatibility may not be worth it, but I don't see why test chains would set `nTx` to a real value without also setting BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS. It seems like we should be able to use BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS to know if nTx is real or fake, as long as we are checking for BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS, directly, and not using the IsValid() helper which is also influenced by BLOCK_FAILED flags.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdated 4c70d993e3ac0e9b7923eded51826fe1faa2d004 -> a3228f02f69e28960f7da76054965c916e781f27 ([`pr/nofake.1`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/nofake.1) -> [`pr/nofake.2`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/nofake.2), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/nofake.1..pr/nofake.2)) to fix broken validation_block_tests due to a buggy check, also making some minor cleanups",

          "body": "`CheckBlockIndex() ` are consistency checks that are currently enabled by default on regtest.\r\n\r\nThe function is rather slow, which is annoying if you\r\n* attempt to run it on other networks, especially if not fully synced\r\n* want to generate a long chain on regtest and see block generation slow down because you forgot to disable `-checkblockindex` or don't know it existed.\r\n\r\nOne reason why it's slow is that in order to be able to traverse the block tree depth-first from genesis, it inserts pointers to all block indices into a `std::multimap` - for which inserts and lookups become slow once there are hundred thousands of entries.\r\nHowever, typically the block index is mostly chain-like with just a few forks so a multimap isn't really needed for the most part. This PR suggests to store the block indices of the chain ending in the best header in a vector instead, and store only the rest of the indices in a multimap. This does not change the actual consistency checks that are being performed for each index, just the way the block index tree is stored and traversed.\r\n\r\nThis adds a bit of complication to make sure each block is visited (note that there are asserts that check it), making sure that the two containers are traversed correctly, but it speeds up the function considerably:\r\n\r\nOn master, a single invocation of `CheckBlockIndex` takes ~1.4s on mainnet for me (4.9s on testnet which has >2.4 million blocks).\r\nWith this branch, the runtime goes down to ~0.27s (0.85s on testnet).This is a speedup by a factor ~5.",

This block would not be\nmarked assumed-valid because it would not be an ancestor of the snapshot, and\nit would have nTx set, nChainTx unset, and prev->nChainTx set with a fake\nvalue, so the assert would fail. After this commit, prev->nChainTx is unset\ninstead of being set to a fake value, so the assert succeeds. A test which\nsubmits a block like this and previously crashed the node has been added in\nfeature_assumeutxo.py. It was written and posted by maflcko in\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29261#issuecomment-1918947945\n\nCompatibility note: This change could result in -checkblockindex failures if a\nsnapshot was loaded by a previous version of Bitcoin Core and not fully\nvalidated, because fake nTx values will have been saved to the block index. It\nwould be pretty easy to avoid these failures by adding some compatibility code\nto `LoadBlockIndex` and changing `nTx` values from 1 to 0 when they are fake\n(when `(pindex->nStatus & BLOCK_VALID_MASK) < BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS`), but a\nlittle simpler not to worry about being compatible in this case.\n\nCo-authored-by: MarcoFalke <*~=`'#}+{/-|&$^_@721217.xyz>",

The reason for removing it is that the block reaching VALID_TRANSACTIONS level is not really significant, because what is actually needed is for the block and all its ancestors back to the snapshot block or genesis block to reach VALID_TRANACTIONS level, and HaveNumChainTxs() is the direct and efficient way to check for that.\r\n\r\nBut it should still be useful to call the IsValid() function because it additionally checks for BLOCK_FAILED flags. So it would be good to add back to avoid changing behavior, and be more efficient if there are invalid blocks.",

Otherwise, nodes which never used loadtxoutset will assume that some block is a \"snapshot block\", even though they never used that feature.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I can do that, but it should not change anything. If loadtxoutset is not used, GetSnapshotBaseBlock will return null and snap_block should already be false. The only case where the suggestion would change the checks performed (when GetSnapshotBaseBlock() == pindex && !pindex->IsAssumedValid()) is the case where background chain has been downloaded and fully validated, and the snapshot block loses it's assumed_valid flag after it become validated. In that case, none of the snap_block conditions will ever be reached. Whether a snapshot block is still considered a snapshot block after the snapshot is validated is just a semantic question.",
