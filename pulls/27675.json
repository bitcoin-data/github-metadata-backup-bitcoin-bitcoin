    "body": "This PR replaces the `m_recently_announced_invs` bloom filter with a simple sequence number tracking the mempool state when we last considered sending an INV message to a node. This saves 33kB per peer (or more if we raise the rate at which we relay transactions over the network, in which case we would need to increase the size of the bloom filter proportionally).\r\n\r\nThe philosophy here (compare with #18861 and #19109) is that we consider the rate limiting on INV messages to only be about saving bandwidth and not protecting privacy, and therefore after you receive an INV message, it's immediately fair game to request any transaction that was in the mempool at the time the INV message was sent. We likewise consider the BIP 133 feefilter and BIP 37 bloom filters to be bandwidth optimisations here, and treat transactions as requestable if they would have been announced without those filters. Given that philosophy, tracking the timestamp of the last INV message and comparing that against the mempool entry time allows removal of each of `m_recently_announced_invs`, `m_last_mempool_req` and `UNCONDITIONAL_RELAY_DELAY` and associated logic.",

In that case the next INV we send on some other connection to the attacker will skip those transactions, providing a new unique set. With this approach, the attacker should be able to receive tx announcements from us at many times the 7tx/s limit we originally set.",

I can see how this simplifies the design, however, I fail to see this being an obvious pick given we'd be potentially even more exposed to fingerprinting than before (as is now it is trivial for every connection to probe data on the node's mempool).\r\n\r\nThis isn't trading off privacy -- that's the point of [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27675#issuecomment-1549711784). It does mean that someone trying to find out whether a recent transaction entered your mempool in the last window doesn't need multiple inbound connections, but that's a good thing: having many inbound connections is easy for an attacker, so avoiding the need to make many inbound connections just means those inbound slots become available for honest peers.\r\n\r\n> So just to be clear, my concern here relates to the fact that the current codebase only allows a peer to request a transaction as long as we have announced that to them (with the exception of data requested after a `MEMPOOL` message if we happen run signaling bip37).\r\n\r\nThat's already the case for any txs that have been in the mempool for greater than two minutes, and any transactions that have been announced to a peer. Generally that's plenty for fingerprinting -- if you announce pairs of conflicting txs randomly to different nodes, then if you do that 20 times at the same low-ish feerate (so that neither will rbf the other), then wait two minutes, you'll likely already get a nearly unique set of txs that will serve as a fingerprint for any given node.\r\n\r\n> After this patch, the logic above won't hold true anymore.

We then use the same window boundaries for all inbound peers so that adding extra inbound peers doesn't give you more precise knowledge.\r\n\r\nIf the attacker only has a single inbound connection, then when the number of txs in a window exceeds `INV_BROADCAST_MAX` they'll get less information; however as the comment above attempted to explain, adding additional inbound connections and manually announcing some txs on some of the connections will allow an attacker to get the full set of txs included in each window. So I don't think it makes sense to consider the `INV_BROADCAST_MAX` limit to have a privacy benefit. (And if we eventually add erlay support, I think that limit goes away entirely for connections doing announcements over erlay rather than INV anyway)",

So the case is:\r\n\r\n- An attacker has `n` inbound connections to node `B` (namely `A0, ..., An-1`)\r\n- `B` sends an `INV` message containing `a, b, c, d` through link `Ai`\r\n    - *During the same message processing loop* for `B`, `A` sends `a, b, c, d` through link `Aj`\r\n    - Now `Aj` will receive an `INV` with a disjoint set for `a, b, c, d` when `B` picks it in this round\r\n\r\nProvided `A` has enough links with `B`, it should be able to get all pending connections in `B`'s mempool in a single round. Is that it? If so, I think this renders all my other comments irrelevant.\r\n\r\n> That's already the case for any txs that have been in the mempool for greater than two minutes, and any transactions that have been announced to a peer.

      "body": "\r\n> > [it is trivial for every connection to probe data on the node's mempool] already the case for any txs that have been in the mempool for greater than two minutes, and any transactions that have been announced to a peer. Generally that's plenty for fingerprinting -- if you announce pairs of conflicting txs randomly to different nodes, then if you do that 20 times at the same low-ish feerate (so that neither will rbf the other), then wait two minutes, you'll likely already get a nearly unique set of txs that will serve as a fingerprint for any given node.\r\n> \r\n> I don't think I follow here though. Would you mind elaborating?\r\n\r\nThe easy way to probe for the presence of transaction X in the mempool is to propose a fake transaction Z that spends an unspent output of X, and a fake transaction Y, with fake signatures for both, and see how its orphan handling behaves. If you receive a request for X and Y, then the victim didn't have X in its mempool; if you receive a request for just Y, then it did have X in the mempool; if you don't receive a request for either, then X was not in the mempool and was in its reject filter.\r\n\r\nIf you want to fingerprint a node, for example to see that an ipv4 address and a tor address are both pointing to the same node, then you need to set things up so that each node in the network has a different set of txs in their mempools, then query them to see if the node behind the ipv4 address and the node behind the tor address have the same set of txs. One way to do that is to propose a bunch of double-spends at the same feerate: a1/a2, b1/b2, c1/c2, etc and fire them off at various nodes on the network, then use the previous technique to see which txs actually ended up in the interesting nodes' mempools.\r\n\r\nNone of that requires careful timing -- you just need to set the feerates so they won't either be mined immediately, nor be evicted from the mempool too quickly.",

      "body": "> It looks like all inbound peers receive the same INVs, which doesn't look like an attack, but normal operation? \r\n\r\nYes, that's ordinary operation, where everyone finds out all the txids you received in an interval automatically. If you'd instead received more than 35 txids in the interval (tx1 .. tx100, say, with tx1 being highest feerate (`compareInvMempoolOrder`)) then everyone would receive `INV tx1..tx35`. For an attacker who wants to know the timing information for all 100 txs, they could make 3 inbound connections, `peerA1` through `peerA3`, as follows:\r\n\r\n * t=4.5, `peerA1` sends INV tx1..tx66 to us\r\n * t=4.51, `peerA2` sends INV tx34..tx100 to us\r\n * t=4.52, `peer A3` sends INV tx1..tx33, tx67..tx100 to us\r\n\r\nand our response would then be to remove the INVed txs from each peer's queue, so when we hit `next_inv_to_inbounds` we'd do:\r\n\r\n * t=5, `SendMessages`, `peerC->m_next_inv_send_time = next_inv_to_inbounds = 10s`, INV tx1..tx35 to C \r\n * t=5.001, `SendMessages`, `peerA1->m_next_inv_send_time = next_inv_to_inbounds`, INV tx67..tx100 to A1\r\n * t=5.002, `SendMessages`, `peerA3->m_next_inv_send_time = next_inv_to_inbounds`, INV tx34..tx66 to A3\r\n * t=5.003, `SendMessages`, `peerA2->m_next_inv_send_time = next_inv_to_inbounds`, INV tx1..tx33 to A2\r\n * t=5.004, `SendMessages`, `peerB->m_next_inv_send_time = next_inv_to_inbounds`, INV tx1..tx35 to B\r\n\r\nand between A1..A3 you receive announcements for all of tx1..tx100 that were accepted into the victim's mempool between the `next_inv_to_inbounds` timestamps of t=0 and t=4.8.\r\n\r\nie, basically if the network's processing up to 7X tx/second, you make X connections to the victim peer, divide the txs you receive into X groups, and announce all txids except for the K'th group to the victim via connection K. (If they request the tx from you, then just quickly reply notfound to avoid biasing the data). Few things to be careful of if you want to actually make that work, but should be find in principle.",

If you receive a request for X and Y, then the victim didn't have X in its mempool; if you receive a request for just Y, then it did have X in the mempool; if you don't receive a request for either, then X was not in the mempool and was in its reject filter.\r\n\r\nThis feels pretty similar to what [TxProbe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00942) used to do to infer links between nodes, and ultimately relates to how orphans are treated differently from mempool transactions both when handed and requested. \r\n\r\nThis is pretty tangential to this PR, but I'm wondering whether it may make sense to change that behavior to always request all the unannounced parents on a given link when an orphan is received through it. In the same way, orphans could be requested, even if known, when offered through a link they haven't been received from. Validation for this type of transaction may even be simplified, given they are already known, so as long as the same data is received nothing else needs to be checked. At a glance, this looks cheap while it will prevent leaking information related to orphans.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> (for me, `sizeof(CTxMemPoolEntry)` even grows from 264 to 280 bytes - packing effects?)\r\n\r\nAdded a commit to fix this.\r\n\r\n> My understanding is that there is a bit of a trade-off with respect to memory (correct me if the byte counting is off!): While it saves 33kB per peer (so ~4MB with 125 peers; ~250kB for non-listening nodes with 8 peers), it also adds at least 8 bytes per mempool entry for `uint64_t entry_sequence`. [..] This seems a bit unsatisfactory because the `entry_sequence` data won't be needed after a few seconds (i.e. after we've sent an inv to each peer).\r\n>\r\n> Assuming a full mempool with `~150k` mempool entries, that is between 1.2 and 2.4MB. Because this is included in the maxmempool limit, it's effectively a decrease in mempool capacity instead of additional memory when the mempool is full.\r\n\r\nEffectively, that's a 0.4% increase in memory usage per tx (2000B per tx for 150k txs in 300MB becomes 2008B per tx for 149.4k txs in 300MB).\r\n\r\nThe main point here though is that with this change is for the case where we need to increase the number of (tx relay) peers or the tx acceptance rate -- the former meaning we'd need to allocate more bloom filters, and the latter meaning we'd need each bloom filter to be significantly bigger (cf #27630).\r\n\r\n> I wonder if there would be a more memory-efficient way to achieve the same behavior - did you consider something like a global list of all recent transactions with timestamp, from which entries could get removed regularly (i.e., after we have sent an inv to each tx-relay peer).\r\n\r\nI did think about that, but it seemed significantly more complicated -- you'd need to either have a map of txid-to-sequence, or a map of txiter-to-sequence; the former would be wasting 24B per entry duplicating the txid, but the latter would need a lot of care to make sure there aren't dangling references to txiters that have been removed from the mempool (and may be reallocated). You'd also need to regularly remove things from this map based on something like `min(peer.last_inv)` over each peer, which seems slightly awkward -- the information in the mempool starts depending on p2p state, rather than just the txs that are in the mempool. \r\n\r\nI do think those approaches would both result in measurable memory savings (1.2MB down to perhaps 100kB at 22tx/sec over 60 seconds?), but to me it just doesn't seem worth the complexity overall.",

The PR is deleting those lines from `ProcessGetData`, and that's fine since an unconfirmed parent's sequence number should before that of its child.\r\nBut I'm not able to see another reason why we should add the txid to the `inventory_known_filter`, so why not delete this whole block?\r\n\r\nIf it's still needed, it probably makes sense to update the 2 comments since they mention recently_announced filter.",

Unlike the latter, if the result of a getter is not used it would not be incorrect, but in that case the call is useless and should be removed; nodiscard just enforces it.\r\n\r\nI use nodiscard for these two cases I describe, where it can simplify review and find issues for me. For instance, when adding it to a declaration I was touching in a pull, it revealed that a relevant unit test was not using the results and thereby highlighted that assertions were missing, which I added. When reviewing a pull having a pure function with many callers or one that is incorrect if not checked, I might add nodiscard and rebuild, and it saves me time if it is already present when initially building the commit.",

(There is no guarantee that TransactionAddedToMempool() will always run in the near future)?\r\n\r\nI meant `TransactionAddedToMempool` event happening, not the validation interface clients' callbacks. IIUC the event firing on main signals (which calls `GetAndIncrementSequence()`) happens in validation before `ProcessTransaction` returns:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e5a9f2fb62dc4db6cad21b2997d96a881ea64125/src/validation.cpp#L1234\r\n\r\nThe queued callbacks are scheduled and may not have necessarily happened yet, but PeerManager doesn't implement `TransactionAddedToMempool`. It is only interested in the current `GetSequence()` and what is recorded in `mempool_sequence`.\r\n\r\n> Basically, I am wondering what happens if you reorder t=2 and t=3 in your example.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that `GetSequence()` returns 2 when `ProcessTransaction` is done, even if t=2 and t=3 are swapped.",

Both assumptions are violated here, and it could make sense to update the doxygen of `CTxMemPoolEntry.m_sequence` for that?\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, may be better to drop the `entry_` prefix from the `CTxMemPoolEntry::entry_sequence` member, since the scope is already clear from the surrounding class. Also, could drop the `entry_` prefix from the constructor parameter name. Finally, could add the `m_` prefix for class members for new code?",
