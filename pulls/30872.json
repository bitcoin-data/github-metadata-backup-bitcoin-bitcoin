    "body": "This restores previous behaviour of being able to exclude a test by name without having to specify .py extension.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30851 that tests were no longer being excluded.\r\n\r\nPR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30244 introduced being able to exclude a specific tests based on args (such as `--exclude \"rpc_bind.py --ipv6`) but it made the wrong assumption that test names intended to be excluded would include the .py extension.\r\n\r\nThe following https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30244#issuecomment-2344009687 shows that this is not how the `--exclude` flag was used in CI.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30244#issuecomment-2344009687 gave three examples of `--exclude` being used in CI so I compared the number of tests that the runner would run for these three examples in three situations, before #30244 was introduced, in master today and with this PR applied.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n`--previous-releases --coverage --extended --exclude feature_dbcrash`\r\n\r\nTest count:\r\nBefore #30244 introduced: 314\r\nMaster: 315\r\nWith this PR: 314\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n`--exclude feature_init,rpc_bind,feature_bind_extra`\r\n\r\nTest count:\r\nBefore #30244 introduced: 306\r\nMaster 311\r\nWith this PR: 306\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n`--exclude rpc_bind,feature_bind_extra`\r\n\r\nBefore #30244 introduced:  307\r\nMaster 311\r\nWith this PR: 307\r\n\r\nI've also tested that the functionality introduced with #30244 remains and we can still exclude specific tests by argument.\r\n",
