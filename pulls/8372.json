    "body": "Using `AddRef()` in `ConnectNode()` for existing connections doesn't feel right imo considering how refs are released in `ThreadSocketHandler()` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net.cpp#L1113. I guess this could be the reason that sometimes refs stay >0 no matter what and nodes stuck in `vNodesDisconnected` forever which means that node never get deleted and `FinalizeNode` signal is never fired which in its turn means that for example `mapBlocksInFlight` can't be cleaned properly and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7596 happens.\n\nThis commit should solve the issue by:\n1. removing `AddRef()` for existing connections\n2. adding `AddRef()` in `CNode`'s constructor using the same conditions as in `ThreadSocketHandler()`\n",

      "body": "Interesting observation!  Thanks for working on this -- I've wondered if we had this type of bug on a few occasions but was never able to pin it down.  And I do think you're on to something, as your PR has made clear at least one situation where I can see that we might end up with extra references to the same node: I believe it can be reproduced by eg using `-connect=<ip>` and `-connect=<hostname>` on the command line, where hostname resolves to the same ip address (I added a LogPrintf() to FinalizeNode and observed that it doesn't seem to get called after disconnecting, eg via setban).\n\nHave you worked out how this extra reference might occur in typical node usage (or better yet, are you able to reproduce this in testing)?  So far the only smoking gun I see is where we're connecting to a peer by address name rather than IP, as I described above, but I don't know if that would be something that would commonly affect a node.\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is if there might be a race condition that could cause this -- eg in OpenNetworkConnections, is it possible that we might call ConnectNode() at:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6e6ab2c3238264b34c0c83ebf703502f5ec72848/src/net.cpp#L1788,\nafter failing to find the ip address we're about to connect to in the call to FindNode at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6e6ab2c3238264b34c0c83ebf703502f5ec72848/src/net.cpp#L1782, but somehow in between that peer has connected to us, and thus it's found when we call FindNode at line https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6e6ab2c3238264b34c0c83ebf703502f5ec72848/src/net.cpp#L388?\n\nI don't know if this is possible or if there's something in place already to prevent that...  If it is, then perhaps in addition to cleaning up the reference counting, we should also be re-thinking locking here.\n\nAlso ping @cfields in case this code is already set for demolition as part of the net refactor.\n",
