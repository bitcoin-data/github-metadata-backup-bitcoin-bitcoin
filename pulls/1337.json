    "body": "This pull is a subset of pull #1311, which many said was too big, and did too many things. It wasn't easy to break it up into smaller pieces as so many are interdependent. Anyway, here goes. Comments welcome.\n\nThis pull adds a command line argument \"-quietinitial\", which is intended to make the \"traffic\" in debug.log less so that the block download progress can be more easily seen. It's off by default, and without using it, things look the same as usual.\n\nI realise that some of what this does can be achieved with 3rd party log file filterers, but some of it can't, and it's mostly developers that use such 3rd party tools, and I'd like to help enable bitcoin to be useful to less technical people too.\n\nThis sub-pull, IMHO, isn't as useful unless combined with some of the other pull requests I've raised (and am still raising, due to hacking #1311 into smaller pieces).\n\nI suspect the others will need rebasing depending on what order the pulls are effected. ho hum..!\n\nHeh... #1337 is a cool pull number :) Not sure this one deserves such a number though!\n\nAnyway, comments welcomed - I need to get a better idea of what makes a good pull or not.\n",
