    "body": "This PR changes the way settings are registered and retrieved to provide more compile-time safety. Currently settings are [registered](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/03cff2c1421e5db59963eba1a845ef5dd318c275/src/init.cpp#L504) and [retrieved](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/03cff2c1421e5db59963eba1a845ef5dd318c275/src/init.cpp#L173) like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// Register setting\r\nargsman.AddArg(\"-pid=<file>\", strprintf(\"Specify pid file. Relative paths will be prefixed by a net-specific datadir location. (default: %s)\", BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME), ArgsManager::ALLOW_ANY, OptionsCategory::OPTIONS);\r\n\r\n// Retrieve setting\r\nargs.GetPathArg(\"-pid\", BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is not ideal because nothing checks that setting names are spelled correctly, or that default values (`BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME`) are used consistently in the help string and retrieval sites, or that settings are retrieved with consistent types (bool, int, string, path, or list). This PR addresses these issues by adding setting [declarations](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/416860fc360b3d5aa1a0782ab8f8454b46e6d657/src/init_settings.h#L267-L270) which allow settings to be [registered](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/416860fc360b3d5aa1a0782ab8f8454b46e6d657/src/init.cpp#L484) and [retrieved](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/416860fc360b3d5aa1a0782ab8f8454b46e6d657/src/init.cpp#L164C38-L164C59) like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// Declare setting\r\nusing PidSetting = common::Setting<\r\n    \"-pid=<file>\", fs::path, {.legacy = true},\r\n    \"Specify pid file. Relative paths will be prefixed by a net-specific datadir location. (default: %s)\">\r\n    ::DefaultFn<[] { return BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME; }>;\r\n\r\n// Register setting\r\nPidSetting::Register(argsman);\r\n\r\n// Retrieve setting\r\nPidSetting::Get(args)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Suggestions for review\r\n\r\nAll the real changes in this PR are in the last scripted-diff commit:\r\n\r\n- [`1f243467cfca` scripted-diff: Replace AddArgs / GetArgs calls with Setting Register / Get calls](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31260/commits/c42d27d8c844b721b5aff384b3d014b1e0cc4783)\r\n\r\nIf you take a few minutes to look at the changes applied in this scripted-diff commit, you'll understand everything this PR is doing. A good place to start looking around in this commit is the generated [`src/init_settings.h`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/scripty/src/init_settings.h) file which declares the settings that get registered in [src/init.cpp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/scripty/src/init.cpp). Then you can look at the surrounding diffs and see they are just replacing `AddArg` and `GetArg` calls.\r\n\r\nThe other notable commit is second commit, which implements the `Setting` class:\r\n\r\n- [`75a010ca238f` common: Add Setting class to support typed Settings](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31260/commits/f9910935c880c782c2b1d35acd38e1e18e6b4ad8)\r\n\r\nThe other commits do minor things like moving code or updating linters. The python script that implements the scripted diff is a temporary artifact that gets deleted. The python script is complicated because it does things like parsing c++ code to extract help strings, and figuring out the right types to declare settings with so code compiles. But the entire scope of the script is to (1) generate Setting type definitions, (2) add #includes, and (3) replace `AddArg()` calls with `Register()` calls and `GetArg()` calls with `Get()` calls. So there is not much the script can actually do wrong without triggering build and test failures.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Extensions\r\n\r\nThis PR only adds the ability to declare individual settings with built-in types. It doesn't provide any new runtime behavior, but a branch in issue #22978 extends the `Setting` class implemented here to support runtime setting validation, additional types like `std::variant`, additional conversion options, custom types, custom validation, and groups of settings declared as options structs.\r\n\r\nThis change is mostly orthogonal to #16545. #16545 only provides runtime type checking while this PR only provides compile-time checking with no new runtime behavior. But this change does allow a nicer way of declaring types in #16545, using c++ types like `int` instead of flags like `ALLOW_INT`, or`std::vector<std::string>` instead of `ALLOW_STRING | ALLOW_LIST`.",

      "body": "Pushed a lot of fixes and updates over the past week and marking this PR as no longer wip/draft. This PR is just a refactoring and doesn't change runtime behavior, but it should be a good start to having better defined settings with clear types and default values, avoiding confusion and bugs caused by the current settings API seen in #30529 and #31212 and other PRs, and making API more extensible to support custom types and validation in the future.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdated 1f243467cfcaa72a8f665141bdb4e5c5af668dfe -> c42d27d8c844b721b5aff384b3d014b1e0cc4783 ([`pr/scripty.7`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/scripty.7) -> [`pr/scripty.8`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/scripty.8), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/scripty.7..pr/scripty.8)) to fix remaining CI issues.",
