    "body": "This PR changes the way settings are registered and retrieved to provide more compile-time safety. Currently settings are [registered](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/03cff2c1421e5db59963eba1a845ef5dd318c275/src/init.cpp#L504) and [retrieved](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/03cff2c1421e5db59963eba1a845ef5dd318c275/src/init.cpp#L173) like:\n\n```c++\n// Register setting\nargsman.AddArg(\"-pid=<file>\", strprintf(\"Specify pid file. Relative paths will be prefixed by a net-specific datadir location. (default: %s)\", BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME), ArgsManager::ALLOW_ANY, OptionsCategory::OPTIONS);\n\n// Retrieve setting\nargs.GetPathArg(\"-pid\", BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME)\n```\n\nBut this is not ideal because nothing checks that setting names are spelled correctly, or that default values (`BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME`) are used consistently in the help string and retrieval sites, or that settings are retrieved with consistent types (bool, int, string, path, or list). This PR addresses these issues by adding setting [declarations](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/416860fc360b3d5aa1a0782ab8f8454b46e6d657/src/init_settings.h#L267-L270) which allow settings to be [registered](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/416860fc360b3d5aa1a0782ab8f8454b46e6d657/src/init.cpp#L484) and [retrieved](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/416860fc360b3d5aa1a0782ab8f8454b46e6d657/src/init.cpp#L164C38-L164C59) like:\n\n```c++\n// Declare setting\nusing PidSetting = common::Setting<\n    \"-pid=<file>\", fs::path, {.legacy = true},\n    \"Specify pid file. Relative paths will be prefixed by a net-specific datadir location. (default: %s)\">\n    ::DefaultFn<[] { return BITCOIN_PID_FILENAME; }>;\n\n// Register setting\nPidSetting::Register(argsman);\n\n// Retrieve setting\nPidSetting::Get(args)\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Suggestions for review\n\nAll the real changes in this PR are in the last scripted-diff commit:\n\n- [scripted-diff: Replace AddArgs / GetArgs calls with Setting Register / Get calls](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31260/commits/fc2591a35b0640adc0df686b0f8bed5f50ada9ce)\n\nIf you take a few minutes to look at the changes applied in this scripted-diff commit, you'll understand everything this PR is doing. A good place to start looking around in this commit is the generated [`src/init_settings.h`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/scripty/src/init_settings.h) file which declares the settings that get registered in [src/init.cpp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/scripty/src/init.cpp). Then you can look at the surrounding diffs and see they are just replacing `AddArg` and `GetArg` calls.\n\nThe other notable commit is second commit, which implements the `Setting` class:\n\n- [common: Add Setting class to support typed Settings](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31260/commits/e1f016180746db0eebc2c2e1e0786f0cc5da8a43)\n\nThe other commits do minor things like moving code or updating linters. The python script that implements the scripted diff is a temporary artifact that gets deleted. The python script is complicated because it does things like parsing c++ code to extract help strings, and figuring out the right types to declare settings with so code compiles. But the entire scope of the script is to (1) generate Setting type definitions, (2) add #includes, and (3) replace `AddArg()` calls with `Register()` calls and `GetArg()` calls with `Get()` calls. So there is not much the script can actually do wrong without triggering build and test failures.\n\n---\n\n#### Extensions\n\nThis PR only adds the ability to declare individual settings with built-in types. It doesn't provide any new runtime behavior, but a branch in issue #22978 extends the `Setting` class implemented here to support runtime setting validation, additional types like `std::variant`, additional conversion options, custom types, custom validation, and groups of settings declared as options structs.\n\nThis change is mostly orthogonal to #16545. #16545 only provides runtime type checking while this PR only provides compile-time checking with no new runtime behavior. But this change does allow a nicer way of declaring types in #16545, using c++ types like `int` instead of flags like `ALLOW_INT`, or`std::vector<std::string>` instead of `ALLOW_STRING | ALLOW_LIST`.",

Replace with BOOST_CHECK_EXCEPTION and provide a predicate (e.g. HasReason(\"...\")) that checks the exact error string to make tests more precise and robust.\n- No Python bare-assert replacement suggestions were found.\n\nIf you want, I can propose exact HasReason message text for each case by inspecting the code paths that throw those exceptions.\n\n\n\n<sup>2026-02-03 20:02:14</sup>\n",

The PR is complete with all functionality described above implemented, but it probably needs more documentation. I also would like to add more commits replacing last remaining GetArg / GetIntArg / GetBoolArg / GetArgs / IsArgSet / IsArgNegated method uses with `Setting::Get` and dropping all those methods.",

Feels a bit risky having links to personal branch instead of specific commit, but it's good to keep it flexible until ACKs come in.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n### Negation?\r\n\r\nI'm curious how you foresee negation checks being done. Having worked on proper handling of negated args recently, to me it feels like user code should have to jump through a hoop on the way to the non-negated value, if an arg supports negation, to encourage conscious negation logic. `common::Disabled` is currently only used in tests, this goes against this comment from #16545:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b5ef85497436c3e9e60c760465d8991592efef07/src/common/args.h#L112-L114\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Impact on compile time from template magic?\r\n\r\nCompiler: GCC 13.3.0\r\nRan `ccache --clear` and deleted cmake `build` directory before each run.\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n```\r\nRun #1\r\nreal\t5m13.786s\r\nuser\t63m16.112s\r\nsys\t4m18.988s\r\n\r\nRun #2\r\nreal\t5m18.751s\r\nuser\t65m23.916s\r\nsys\t4m29.586s\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n```\r\nRun #1\r\nreal\t5m16.808s\r\nuser\t65m15.770s\r\nsys\t4m27.238s\r\n\r\nRun #2\r\nreal\t5m21.099s\r\nuser\t66m22.265s\r\nsys\t4m32.162s\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Conclusion\r\n\r\nSlightly faster before, but overlapping timings. Should be okay.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Commit message for f310e17e73bd1cea74aa45fd94192f24df122f86:\r\n\r\nTypo: \"headers from being >be< included\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### `Value(args).isNull()`\r\n\r\n`DatadirSetting::Value(args).isNull()` vs `DatadirSettingPath::Get(args)` - feels weird to call the former `Value()` ... it's like `std::optional::value()` but in reverse.

The compiler benchmarking is especially interesting and commit message typo should be fixed now. The camelcasing dictionary is also a great idea and I will definitely implement that.\r\n\r\n> ### Negation?\r\n> I'm curious how you foresee negation checks being done. Having worked on proper handling of negated args recently, to me it feels like user code should have to jump through a hoop on the way to the non-negated value, if an arg supports negation, to encourage conscious negation logic. `common::Disabled` is currently only used in tests, this goes against this comment from #16545:\r\n\r\nIn most cases, it makes sense for negated bool arguments to be false, negated int arguments to be 0, and negated string/path/list arguments to be empty. With the `Setting` class and default types these conversions are made automatically, except that for backward compatibility when `.legacy = true` is set, negated strings are returned as \"0\". In cases where the default behavior doesn't make sense, there is support for `std::variant` in my #22978 branch, where custom negation behavior can be implemented by choosing a setting type like `std::variant<Disabled, T>`.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22978#issuecomment-2265757710: \"`std::variant<Disabled, T>` might be useful for special cases or backwards compatibility to detect negated values and treat them differently from 0 and \"\". For example if you had a `-bwlimit` setting and wanted to treat `-nobwlimit` as \"use unlimited bandwidth\" and `-bwlimit=0` as \"use no bandwidth\" using a variant with a Disabled member allows that.\"\r\n\r\n> ### `Value(args).isNull()`\r\n> `DatadirSetting::Value(args).isNull()` vs `DatadirSettingPath::Get(args)` - feels weird to call the former `Value()` ... it's like `std::optional::value()` but in reverse. The fact that settings are backed by `UniValue`s help explain it, but still looks inelegant. I see this style comes from a [latter revision](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31260#issuecomment-2472025885) to trigger parsing and possible exceptions.\r\n\r\nI tend to agree but just to explain the thinking, the method is called `Value()` because it returns the JSON `SettingsValue` type, and the name makes some sense because it is returning the raw JSON value without interpreting it as a bool/int/string/path or other type. Using the `Value()` method should be pretty strongly discouraged, so it's not neccesarily a bad thing if usage looks inelegant. This PR is only using `Value()` in the scripted-diff commit to emulate `IsArgSet` and `IsArgNegated` behavior and avoid the parsing exceptions you mentioned which could change behavior of the current code and break compatibility.\r\n\r\nBut all the code using `Value()` would be better off not using it. This could be done by switching to better default values or by switching to `std::optional<>` or `std::variant<>` types. There should be basically be no reason to call `Value()` in new code and your PR #31212 and my #30529 will eliminate a bunch of uses of `Value()` here assuming they are merged before this PR.\r\n\r\n> Maybe a `DatadirSetting::IsArgSet(args)` wrapper could be added?\r\n\r\nI would want to avoid this just because I think the `IsArgSet` function is a footgun. I think it's preferable to use `Default<>` and `DefaultFn<>` to set static defaults whenever possible, and to use to use the `std::optional<>` when dynamic defaults are needed, and to never call `IsArgSet` in any case.",

So instead of approaching this row-by-row (apply each change to every occurance and continue with different changeset in different PRs), I would be interested in doing the changes end-to-end for a small subset of the settings instead (i.e. settings with validation and normalization and error handling and type safety for the helpers only, keeping the others completely intact) - i.e. column-by-column (using a tabular iteration as a metaphor).\r\n\r\nYou might consider giving a partial ACK to the parts of the PR you are ok with, and pointing out other parts you don't feel able to sign off on.\r\n\r\nBut I think the underlying issue here might be that you haven't totally grokked yet which changes are included and are not included in this PR, which is understandable because the scripted diff is very big, so it is hard to see that changes you might be expecting are *not* being made, and that the scope of the PR is in fact, very limited.\r\n\r\nTo help clarify things, I decided to follow up with your idea from [last review](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31260#pullrequestreview-2492047895) and show what this change would look like in tiny commits instead of in a big commit. I would encourage you to maybe just look at few of these commits at random, and either see that that changes are obvious or ask me any questions about what is not obvious.\r\n\r\nIf you still couldn't ack the PR after this because you couldn't review every line manually that would be understandable. But you should at least be able to see that the script is really just replacing GetArg calls with equivalent Get calls and AddArg calls with equivalent Register calls and not doing anything else beyond that.\r\n\r\nFor reference the branch with tiny commits can be found at https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/scripty-tiny and there aren't any differences between it and this PR, other than being split up into more commits. The branch was generated by running the script with a new `--git-commit` option to automatically create a git commit after each setting replacement.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>commits</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n- 629c302c18d4281f41a4995b125c9da00842fe72 init_settings.h: Add CheckAddrManSetting\r\n- de6edd0be26028fd075db5f2dc6b89933047d1b1

Seems off?\r\n\r\nGood catch. I wanted to avoid changing these to keep the commit move-only as much as possible but it doesn't make sense to have std::strings that could do allocations duplicated across translation units, so they are switched to constexpr string literal types now. I think the other static const values should not be a problem since they should just be stripped out if not referenced and not create any symbols, so I did leave those, but could change if preferred.",

The code treats an explicitly set `-dnsseed` differently than the default value and triggers an error if it is specified along with with `-onlynet`. Conceptually it seems like the `-dnseed` setting really has three values: \"yes\" \"no\" and \"always\" and the default value is \"yes\" but an explicitly set `-dnsseed` value means \"always\" and triggers an error if it cannot be satisfied.\r\n\r\nA cleaner way to implement support for `-dnsseed` would probably be to define an `Options` struct and interpret `-dnseed` and related settings one place instead of 5 different places. But for the purposes of this PR, no behavior is changing and new code basically looks the same as the old code and shouldn't be much more or much less confusing.",

Adding this wasn't as necessary as I initially thought it might be to remove most of the GetArg* calls in the codebase. But I am looking into more ways to expand the PR and maybe drop the GetArg methods methods entirely. Depending on how much work this it could be a follow-up and in any case doesn't need to block anything.",

This style of using `auto` as function-arg-type when not necessary feels like the opposite of C++ concepts, potentially leading to downstream compile errors. But interested to hear reasoning behind it.\r\n\r\nGood catch, this was just done early in a prototype and I never changed it. Updated to use explicit types now.",

I think better code completion is a real reason to want to group these identifiers. I will try to implement that in my next push, probably using `namespace settings` nested in any existing namespaces. Sorry for resisting before, I think I just really didn't like the ambiguity of having a class and namespace with the same name.\r\n\r\nOn the inversion idea writing `Get<TestActivationHeight>` instead of `TestActivationHeight::Get`, it wouldn't be my preference just because of the template syntax, but it seems fine if other reviewers prefer it or it solves other problems.",

The only changes in this commit are replacing GetArgs calls with equivalent Get calls, AddArgs calls with equivalent Register calls.\r\n\r\n> Would it be possible to go end-to-end for a very narrow part of the settings and slowly strangle out the old version (i.e. depth-first-search instead of breadth first search)?\r\n\r\nIf I'm understanding the request correctly, you want to see what parsing/validation/normalization behavior looks like in combination with this PR for a narrow set of settings. I think you can look at https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/argtype/src/test/argsman_tests.cpp from #22978 for an idea of that. And I am happy to update that branch because it precedes this PR and is somewhat stale at this point.\r\n\r\nI think it is important to be clear about the relationship between this PR and #22978 though. This PR is not changing any functionality or providing any new behavior. It is only doing a mechanical search and replace of GetArgs with Get calls and AddArgs with Register calls, so that settings can be accessed from a type-safe API  and will have associated types and default values. #22978 implements various new pieces of functionality on top of the type-safe API.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If so, we could use that here as well\r\n\r\nMaybe we are talking past each other with different terminology, but the point of allowing the settings framework to specify default values is to avoid needing to care whether a setting was set or unset. The setting can simply be retrieved and if the user did not set a value, the framework can provide an appropriate default.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I would answer the question as no. The == \"\" check is just checking if the setting is empty, not checking if it is set. The setting might have been unset or it might have been set by the user to empty, and the code retrieving the setting should not care which of these was the case.",

In most cases it is not needed anyway, or used incorrectly. About this one, I left a comment here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31887/files#r1959923000\r\n\r\nYes, the `!isNull` calls are just replacements for `IsArgSet()` and one goal of this PR is to discourage any calls like this, because of the bugs and unnecessary complexity these checks introduce. The way forward is for PR's like #30529 and #31896 to drop them.",
