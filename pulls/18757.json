The chainstate manager is primarily needed for the assumeutxo feature, but it can also simplify testing in the future.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this pull is to make the global chainstate manager internal to validation, so that all external code does not depend on globals and that unit or fuzz tests can pass in their (potentially mocked) chainstate manager.\r\n\r\nI suggest reviewing the pull request commit-by-commit. It should be relatively straightforward refactoring that does not change behavior at all.",
