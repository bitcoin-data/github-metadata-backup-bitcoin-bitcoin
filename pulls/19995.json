    "body": "Mitigate disk filling attacks by temporarily rate limiting `LogPrintf(…)`.\r\n\r\nA disk fill attack is an attack where an untrusted party (such as a peer) is able to cheaply make your node log to disk excessively. The excessive logging may fill your disk and thus make your node crash either cleanly (best case: if disk fill rate is relatively slow) or uncleanly (worst case: if disk fill rate is relatively fast).\r\n\r\nThe hourly logging quota is set *per source location*. Every single source location (say `net_processing.cpp:418`) gets a quota of 1 MB of logging per hour.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* Only logging to disk is rate limited. Logging to console is not rate limited.\r\n* Only `LogPrintf(…)` is rate limited. `LogPrint(category, …)` (`-debug`) is not rate limited.\r\n* `UpdateTip: new best=[…]` is logged using `LogPrintfWithoutRateLimiting(…)` to avoid rate limiting. High log volume is expected for that source location during IBD.\r\n\r\nLive demo:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n$ git diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/init.cpp b/src/init.cpp\r\nindex 023aa9aba..56a250876 100644\r\n--- a/src/init.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/init.cpp\r\n@@ -1232,6 +1232,13 @@ bool AppInitInterfaces(NodeContext& node)\r\n     return true;\r\n }\r\n \r\n+void SimulateDiskFillingAttack() {\r\n+    uint64_t n = 0;\r\n+    while (true) {\r\n+        LogPrintf(\"Chancellor on brink of %d:th bailout for banks.

(The 15 GB/hour was achieved on a really old machine with mechanical disks so YMMV.)\r\n\r\nIn other words: the mitigation slowed that specific attack by a factor of 15 000 :)\r\n\r\nNote that the quota is set *per source location*. So every single source location (say `net_processing.cpp:418`) gets a quota of 1 MB of logging per hour. I think we could bump that to 10 MB/hour or even 100 MB/hour and still largely kill this bug class.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I misunderstood what you meant by the `INV`/`ADDR`/`GETADDR` bytes per second thing, but we only log per such message via `LogPrint(CATEGORY, …)` (`-debug`). `LogPrint(CATEGORY, …)` is intentionally not covered by the rate limiting, since end-users opt-ing in to `-debug` are assumed to know that doing so may cause excessive disk usage :)\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to kill this bug class for a `bitcoind` node running with default settings (no `-debug`).",

In contrast to what I first thought, this is not because of the `__FILE__`. There's only 12 kB more in strings. The rest is extra instructions in `.text` to pass the line number to every logging call.\r\n\r\n(still concept ACK though, and thanks for addressing my comments, code changes LGTM now)",

I'm not convinced that shedding logs per location is a good idea. Partial logs are often worse than no logs at all and can be very misleading (\"it logged this and then it didn't log this, so it can't have taken this code branch\"). Even with a special \"Suppressing logging to disk from this source location\" log, it's very easy to be misled unless you know exactly what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nI think I'd prefer log-shedding to be done globally, with a special log at the end of a log suppression period that tallies up which log locations have been suppressed.",

I'm happy to change the name of course.\r\n\r\nI expect `LogPrintfWithoutRateLimiting` to be used once: for `UpdateTip` which is the only non-category log message which we ever expect to legitimately log at a rate of >1 MB/hour (or whatever hourly source-location threshold we choose).\r\n\r\nOne alternative would be to call `LogPrintf_` directly from `UpdateTip` as it is a one-off. That would solve the naming problem too :)",
