    "body": "The possibility of this happening came up in the discussion here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31158#issuecomment-2635223309, and it turned that we already had a case of it in our code.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Certain symbols when defined in headers may end up existing in both the shared lib and the application using it, leading to subtle bugs. More info can be found [here](https://www.mail-archive.com/cfe-commits@lists.llvm.org/msg503669.html).\r\n\r\nThe solution is generally to avoid defining static/inline vars in headers if they aren't meant to be shared with downstream kernel users.\r\n\r\nClang has recently added a warning for this (see link above), so this PR enables that too. It adds a new place to specify warnings which only apply to the kernel. In this case, it's warnings that only apply to shared libs. But I can also imagine wanting to enable more aggressive warnings for the kernel than the rest of the code.\r\n\r\nThe warning is only enabled by clang 21 (which is not yet released), and only useful when our [kernel symbol visibility hack](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/kernel/CMakeLists.txt#L100) is disabled, which we can't do yet. So it's mostly a placeholder for the future. In the meantime it can be used manually by building clang from git and disabling our hack, which I've done, and can confirm that after this change there are no more warnings.",

In this case, a warning is added for symbols which\nmay be duplicated between the kernel and downstream users.\n\nA few caveats for now:\n- This warning is introduced in clang 21, which is not yet released\n- The warning doesn't actually show unless the CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hack is\n  disabled in CMake, which won't happen for a while.\n\nSo this warning is not helpful for CI at the moment, but it's possible to use\nit manually (as I have for this PR) by disabling the hack locally until then.",

Symbol resolution between shared libs and binaries is linker/loader specific. See ld's options for duplicate/weak symbol handling for example, or macOS's complicated mess of namespacing. Windows forces you to specify \"I'm importing this from a dll\", which is kinda nice actually.\r\n\r\nYou're right that the warning is aimed at \"multiple shared libraries\", but our Linux binaries are basically just shared libs with an entry point. You can even link against bitcoind or dlopen from it as though it's a .so. That's why I'm concerned about linker behavior.\r\n\r\nGoing to convert this to draft for now. I doubt it'll even matter much as we'll probably never selectively export our c++ symbols. But I still don't have 100% confidence in the `cs_main` issue from #31158.\r\n\r\nEdit: Hah, [here's an s/o answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55635250) that more elegantly says what I attempted above.",
