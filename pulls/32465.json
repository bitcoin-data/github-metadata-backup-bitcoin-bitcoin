    "body": "This is one of several PRs to cleanup/modernize our threading primitives.\r\n\r\nWhile replacing the old critical section locks in the mining code with a `REVERSE_LOCK`, I noticed that our thread-safety annotations weren't hooked up to it. This PR gets `REVERSE_LOCK` working properly.\r\n\r\nFirstly it modernizes the attributes as-recommended by the [clang docs](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html) (ctrl+f for `USE_LOCK_STYLE_THREAD_SAFETY_ATTRIBUTES`). There's a subtle difference between the old `unlock_function` and new `release_capability`, where our `reverse_lock` only works with the latter. I believe this is an upstream bug. I've [reported and attempted a fix here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/139343), but either way it makes sense to me to modernize.\r\n\r\nThe second commit just fixes an unrelated logging bug that I noticed while hacking around in here.\r\n\r\nThe third adds a missing annotation pointed out by a fixed `REVERSE_LOCK`. Because clang's thread-safety annotations aren't passed through a reference to `UniqueLock` as one may assume (see [here](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#no-alias-analysis) for more details), `cs_main` has to be listed explicitly as a requirement.\r\n\r\nThe last commit actually fixes the `reverse_lock` by making it a `SCOPED_LOCK` and using the pattern [found in a clang test](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/SemaCXX/warn-thread-safety-analysis.cpp#L3126). Though the docs don't describe how to accomplish it, the functionality was added [in this commit](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/6a68efc959bd1024506bf661a9e155de8a8440da). Due to aliasing issues (see link above), in order to work correctly, the original mutex has to be passed along with the lock, so all existing `REVERSE_LOCK`s have been updated. To ensure that the mutexes actually match, a runtime assertion is added.",

If release_generic can't disambiguate these situations, what is it even useful for annotating?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI can see empirically why undoing just this part of the diff\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n\r\n-#define UNLOCK_FUNCTION(...) __attribute__((release_capability(__VA_ARGS__)))\r\n+#define UNLOCK_FUNCTION(...) __attribute__((unlock_function(__VA_ARGS__)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis passage:\r\n```cpp\r\n    if (block.m_data) {\r\n        REVERSE_LOCK(lock, cs_main);\r\n        if (!blockman.ReadBlock(*block.m_data, *index)) block.m_data->SetNull();\r\n    }\r\n    block.found = true;\r\n ```\r\n \r\n \r\nresults in the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/node/interfaces.cpp:449:19: warning: mutex 'cs_main' is not held on every path through here [-Wthread-safety-analysis]\r\n  449 |     block.found = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich indicates that the thread safety analyzer does not understand the \"unlock capability\" was released and the lock was taken again when the reverse lock went out of scope, I'm just not sure I understand why.",

If release_generic can't disambiguate these situations, what is it even useful for annotating?\r\n\r\nMy best guess is that a generic unlock is intended to be usable for either a shared/unshared mutex. There's [conflicting info about what's supposed to happen when you call `unlock()` on a shared mutex](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44652353/call-unlock-on-stdshared-mutex-that-is-locked-in-shared-mode), so perhaps the generic annotation is intended to simply work as both without complaining either way?\r\n\r\n> Which indicates that the thread safety analyzer does not understand the \"unlock capability\" was released and the lock was taken again when the reverse lock went out of scope, I'm just not sure I understand why.\r\n\r\nThis was my observation as well, and I think it's as simple as \"this is a clang bug\".
