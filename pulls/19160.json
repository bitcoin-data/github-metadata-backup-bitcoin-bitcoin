    "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds basic process spawning and IPC method call support to `bitcoin-node` executables built with `--enable-multiprocess`[*].\r\n\r\nThese changes are used in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102 to let node, gui, and wallet functionality run in different processes, and extended in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19460 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461 after that to allow gui and wallet processes to be started and stopped independently and connect to the node over a socket.\r\n\r\nThese changes can also be used to implement new functionality outside the `bitcoin-node` process like external indexes or pluggable transports (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18988). The `Ipc::spawnProcess` and `Ipc::serveProcess` methods added here are entry points for spawning a child process and serving a parent process, and being able to make bidirectional, multithreaded method calls between the processes. A simple example of this is implemented in commit \"Add echoipc RPC method and test.\"\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR aside from the echo test were originally part of #10102, but have been split and moved here for easier review, and so they can be used for other applications like external plugins.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes about this PR can be found at https://bitcoincore.reviews/19160\r\n\r\n[*] Note: the `--enable-multiprocess` feature is still experimental, and not enabled by default, and not yet supported on windows. More information can be found in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)",

This way a common BitcoinApplication object can be used for all qt tests, but they can still have their own testing setups.\r\n\r\nNon-test code is changing but non-test behavior is still the same as before.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this PR is to be able to remove the \"std::move(test.m_node.connman)\" and mempool hacks for swapping individual NodeContext members in Qt tests, because followup PR #19099 adds yet another member (wallet_client) that needs to be swapped. After this change, the whole NodeContext struct can be swapped instead of individual members, so the workarounds are less fragile and invasive.",

Removing redundant checks\r\n* Checking returned json against documentation to avoid regressions or false documentation\r\n* Compile the RPC documentation at compile-time to ensure it doesn't change at runtime and is completely static\r\n\r\n### Bugs found\r\n\r\n* The assert identified issue #18607 \r\n* The changes itself fixed bug #19250 ",

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an `--enable-multiprocess` configure option which builds new `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables with relevant functionality isolated into different processes. See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n",

          "title": "RFC: Introducing AltNet, a pluggable framework for alternative transports",
          "body": "**As of 14/03/2022 (chain tip hash : 00000000000000000000628002621832be9281faf72c394e66a8bc8446f80c75), this project is under implementation in separate process relying on the multiprocess framework. See https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/56 for more information on current state.**\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a new subsystem aiming towards providing a generic framework for integrating alternative transport communication channels inside Bitcoin Core. This PR is a functional proof-of-concept using LN transport protocol as a new link layer for header fetching. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18989 for high-level discussion and proposal merits.\r\n\r\n## The Design \r\n\r\nPrevious [work](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17376) has been attempted to increase network security and robustness by increasing communication redundancy. While being optional and fault-tolerant, these attempt don't scale well to integrate a wide-range of alternatives such as [domain-fronting](https://www.bamsoftware.com/papers/fronting/), [orbital communications](https://github.com/Blockstream/satellite), [amateur radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DASH7), [Tor pluggable transports](https://snowflake.torproject.org/), unlicensed UHF, Bluetooth, [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/), Lightning[ Noise transport](http://noiseprotocol.org/), ... Each of these transports has its own availability, latency, don't bind to the Berkeley sockets model, are unidirectional, require custom peer discovery, are not suited for block traffic, ...\r\n\r\nThis proposal tries to overcome these issues by laying out a generic \"driver\" framework with its own new processing stack, thereby encapsulating per-transport oddities. It introduces:\r\n\r\n* Per-transport capabilities (`TransportCapabilities`). Originally declared by each driver, they abstract driver specifities to general flags, like directionality, protocol messages scope. They could be extended with further attributes, like max bandwidth for adjusted packing or \"privacy\"/\"trustness\" niceness of the link.\r\n* Abstract driver model (`CDriver`). Basically, it dissociate driver warmup, message preprocessing, sending and reception. Ideally you would want to load them dynamically.\r\n* \"Anycast\" header-fetching (`AltLogicValidation::BlockHeaderAnomalie`). After notification from the [watchdog module](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18987), it sends a `GETHEADERS` message to any peers supporting bidirectionality and headers processing.\r\n* Alternative processing stack (`AltLogicValidation`). Relying on its own threads, it manages drivers and may take action based on static logical capabilites instead of peer state, reducing likelihood of bugs. In the future, one could implement a more robust headers-syncing strategy like reverse-header or compressed headers. It may also leverage a [future asynchronous validation interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18963).\r\n\r\nThere are many advantages of this kind of design --, it is easy to integrate new drivers binding to an abstract class, it is easy to reason about due to logical capabilities and at the same time provides granular tuning due to the fine-integration with rpc. Peer discovery and policy or bandwidth/memory DoS-protection are all possible driver add-ons as well. One could envision an rpc like `sendemergencytx`, broadcasting a transaction on any transport protocol available, like a [LN's justice transaction](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/05-onchain.md#revoked-transaction-close-handling) after detection of being eclipsed.\r\n\r\nThis module could be made entirely optional at compile-time with `--enable-altnet` even if such integration with the build system hasn't been made.\r\n\r\nObviously this is an exploratory PoC, I don't expect code here to be merged. Beyond worthiness of doing this in Rust there are a lot of open questions, including the threading/memory model, interface with existing codebase, build system, resources consumption and fault-tolerance. As next steps, I would favor building on the multiprocess work and hosting this new network stack in its own to avoid any bug contamination from introducing complex driver. I encourage those with opinions on the higher level motivation and design discussion to leave their ideas on the linked issue.\r\n\r\nHigh-level design:\r\n\r\n\r\n              ___________            ______________________\r\n             |           |          |                      |\r\n             | CWatchdog |----------|  AltLogicValidation  |\r\n             |___________|          |______________________|\r\n                                               |\r\n                                         ______|______\r\n                                        |             |\r\n                                        |  CAltstack  |                                                         \r\n                                        |_____________| \r\n                                               |\r\n                                           ____|____\r\n                                          |         |\r\n                                          | CDriver |\r\n                                          |_________|\r\n                                               |\r\n                                       ________|__________\r\n                                      |                  |\r\n                                      | ClightningDriver |\r\n                                      |__________________|\r\n                                      \r\n                                                   \r\n\r\n## The Demo\r\n\r\nThis PoC features a header-fetching round-trip, leveraging LN connection protocol. Each LN node connects to its peers through an encrypted and authenticated channel. Since your LN peer must have chain access, you could leverage this privileged link to create a redundant chain access.\r\n\r\nUsing C-lightning [custom LN message support](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/3315) and [plugin API](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/PLUGINS.md), we could embed directly inside `HEADERS`/`GETHEADERS` and realize a round-trip between 2 disconnected bitcoin nodes through their respective C-lightning nodes.\r\n\r\nFor this to work, you need to compile and run 2 C-lightning nodes,  each with its own data directory and launched with this [custom bridge plugin](https://github.com/ariard/bridge-layer). Once those LN nodes are running, activate bridges by `lightning-cli alice_on` and `lightning-cli bob_on`. The plugin doesn't seem to accept CLI argument so I had to hardcode some node addresses.\r\n\r\nThen compile 2 bitcoin nodes with this patchset. For one of them you must change the hardcoded port in C-lightning driver and deactivate the watchdog logic. Also, it would be best if you changed `SCAN_INTERVAL` to something reasonable, for instance 1 min.\r\n\r\nHigh-level setup:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 -->\r\n\r\n                    __________          LN_msg(`GETHEADERS`)                   ________\r\n                   |          |                                               |        |\r\n                   | CL-Alice |-----------------------------------------------| CL-Bob |\r\n                   |__________|                                               |________|           \r\n                        |               LN_msg(`HEADERS`)                         |\r\n                    ____|_____                                                 ___|_____\r\n                   |          |                 <--                           |         |\r\n                   |  bridge  |                                               | bridge  |\r\n                   |__________|                                               |_________|\r\n                        |                                                         |\r\n                    ____|_____                                                 ___|____\r\n                   |          |                                               |        |\r\n                   | BC-Alice |                                               | BC-Bob |\r\n                   |__________|                                               |________|\r\n\r\n                      HEIGHT                                                   HEIGH + 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning both nodes, they should automatically connect to the bridge, and after anomaly detection realize a header exchange, if one of them is at least one block forward (run `generatetoaddress 1 $ADDR`).\r\n\r\nOtherwise you may observe past logs:\r\n\r\nAlice:\r\n```\r\nÊ0-05-16T00:55:11Z Boostrapping Altstack\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z init message: Done loading\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z msghand thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z drivers-warmup thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z addcon thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Registered driver with 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z net thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z altstack-processing thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Clightning - Warmup\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z dnsseed thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z altstack-handle thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z 0 addresses found from DNS seeds\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z dnsseed thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Clightning - Bridge connection\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z Registering node_id 0 with driver_id 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:11Z drivers-warmup thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Block header anomalie detected - notifying subscribers\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Block header anomalie detected - Anycasting header fetching from 0f9188f13cb7b2c71f2a335e3a4fc328bf5beb436012afca590b1a11466e2206\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Clightning - Preprocessing getheader\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:16Z Cligthning - Bridge send success 71\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:19Z Cligtning - Bridge receive success\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:19Z Receive HEADERS from 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:19Z Receiver header 65084efeaffe9929de0a0bb747cf48ac7f9b4edb214b2d1ad2ea468977be8e1e vs tip 0f9188f13cb7b2c71f2a335e3a4fc328bf5beb436012afca590b1a11466e2206\r\n```\r\n\r\nBob:\r\n``` \r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Boostrapping Altstack\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z addcon thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z opencon thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z msghand thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z drivers-warmup thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Registered driver with 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Clightning - Warmup\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z init message: Done loading\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z dnsseed thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z altstack-processing thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z altstack-handle thread start\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Clightning - Bridge connection\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z Registering node_id 0 with driver_id 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:09Z drivers-warmup thread exit\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:10Z Leaving InitialBlockDownload (latching to false)\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Cligtning - Bridge receive success\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Receive GETHEADERS from 0\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Fetch header starting from 0f9188f13cb7b2c71f2a335e3a4fc328bf5beb436012afca590b1a11466e2206, tip 65084efeaffe9929de0a0bb747cf48ac7f9b4edb214b2d1ad2ea468977be8e1e\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Sending back 1 headers\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Clightning - Preprocessing header\r\n2020-05-16T00:55:17Z Cligthning - Bridge send success 84\r\n2020-05-16T00:56:10Z Adding fixed seed nodes as DNS doesn't seem to be available.\r\n```",

For example, there could be a `bitcoin-wallet sync` command that will update balances and sync latest transactions to an unloaded wallet, or a `bitcoin-wallet serve` subcommand that loads a wallet and serves RPC requests, or a `bitcoin-wallet shell` subcommand that allows running RPC methods interactively like the GUI console, or just general support for `bitcoin-wallet <rpc method> <rpc params>` invocations suggested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13926#issuecomment-455187379.\r\n\r\nThis PR is small and doesn't do much. The only visible change is that `bitcoin-wallet` now checks whether a node socket exists on startup and prints \"Connected to IPC address\" if it can connect it it.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-wallet` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which connects if possible as described above, and proceeds offline if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to disable ipc, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)\r\n",

This allows the GUI to be started and stopped independently of the node. By default with this change, `bitcoin-gui` will check if a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` socket exists and try to connect to that. If that doesn't work, it will spawn a new node process and start up the same way it did before this PR.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-gui` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which tries to connect if possible as described above, and spawns a new `bitcoin-node` process if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to never connect to an existing node and always spawn a new one, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, basic functionality works and gui instances can connect and disconnect from a running node. But there are rough edges: If a gui process doesn't shut down cleanly, the node can see unhandled IpcExceptions, and if node command line options are passed to `bitcoin-gui` and `bitcoin-gui` connects to an exiting bitcoin-node process instead of spawning a new one, the node options will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)",

This was new behavior since 6a72f26968cf931c985d8d4797b6264274cabd06 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16426 and is not ideal because it stops other wallets and rpcs and the gui from receiving new notifications until after the scan completes.\r\n\r\nThis change is a half-step towards implementing multiwallet scans (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11756), since it provides needed locator and birthday timestamp information to the Chain interface, and it rationalizes locking and event ordering in the startup code. The second half of implementing parallel rescans requires moving the ScanForWalletTransactions implementation (which this PR does not touch) from the wallet to the node.",

Description from the main pr:\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nRPCArg names in the rpc help are currently only used for documentation. However, in the future they could be used to teach the server the named arguments. Named arguments are currently registered by the `CRPCCommand`s and duplicate the RPCArg names from the documentation. This redundancy is fragile, and has lead to errors in the past (despite having linters to catch those kind of errors). See section \"bugs found\" for a list of bugs that have been found as a result of the changes here.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe changes here add an assert in the `CRPCCommand` constructor that the RPCArg names are identical to the ones in the `CRPCCommand`.\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n\r\n> Here or follow up, makes sense to also assert type of returned UniValue?\r\n\r\nSure, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. I am going to submit any further works as follow-ups, including:\r\n\r\n* Removing the CRPCCommand arguments, now that they are asserted to be equal and thus redundant\r\n* Removing all python regex linters on the args, now that RPCMan can be used to generate any output, including the cli.cpp table\r\n* Auto-formatting and sanity checking the RPCExamples with RPCMan\r\n* Checking passed-in json in self-check. Removing redundant checks\r\n* Checking returned json against documentation to avoid regressions or false documentation\r\n* Compile the RPC documentation at compile-time to ensure it doesn't change at runtime and is completely static\r\n\r\n### Bugs found\r\n\r\n* The assert identified issue #18607 \r\n* The changes itself fixed bug #19250 ",

For example arguments that have never been registered, but are still used, will always return the fallback value.\r\n* Tests may run several sub-tests, which need different settings. So globals will have to be overwritten, but that is fragile on its own: e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19704#issuecomment-678259092 or #19511\r\n\r\nThe goal is to remove gArgs, but as a first step in that direction this pull will change gArgs in init to use a passed-in reference instead.\r\n\r\n",

But if I revert the changes in this PR the error goes away. The difference seems to be caused by cmake no longer setting RUNPATH after this PR. With this PR, RUNPATH is empty, but if this PR is reverted, readelf shows:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ readelf -d depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/native/bin/mpgen | grep RUNPATH\r\n 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [/home/russ/src/bitcoin/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/native/lib]\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I need to dig in more but two questions I have are:\r\n\r\n> 1. Why did travis not catch this problem when this PR was being worked on or after this PR was merged. Is there a cache that we failed to clear? Is there a cache we should be clearing when we update depends scripts in the future? (The travis error above started happening after I pushed a PR update that bumped the `depends/packages/native_libmultiprocess.mk` package, so I think that accounts for why a cache might have been avoided in the failing run above).\r\n\r\n> 2. What change in this PR might be clobbering the cmake RUNPATH? If I had to guess it might be happening because the LDFLAGS environment variable was unset previously, but now it is set",

I think the review challenge is to write-up some detailed walkthrough giving a high-level picture of how every component is working when multiple processes are effectively used. See my specific comment for a starter, likely it could be in `src/interfaces/README.md` ?\r\n\r\nNote, following the current #Installation section from `doc/multiprocess` doesn't work on Debian 10.2, the generared Makefile doesn't incorporate a `bitcoin-node` target.

Building on top of this PR, #19160 should now be able to organize interface implementations more understandably in `src/node/` `src/wallet/` `src/ipc/` and `src/init/` directories instead of having so much functionality all in `src/interfaces/`",

The most noticeable changes are moves and renames: `src/interfaces/` directory is now now more minimal and now only contains interface definitions, with functionality that was previously in `src/interfaces/` is moved into `src/node/` and `src/wallet/` and new `src/init/` and `src/ipc/` directories. The confusing `LocalInit` class is now gone and IPC setup happens explicitly through `interfaces::Ipc` calls in node, wallet, and RPC code instead of the previous confusing approach where the `Init` class was responsible for setting up IPC connections, and it was less obvious which objects were remote and local. There are also a lot of other cleanups and documentation improvements, and a rebase on new base PR #20494\r\n\r\nRebased ee7b3cdc72df06ce674a83b980cfb7e6ef657fc6 -> a3d7a9864b16432b567a1c31613e5e5fe9eb1231 ([`pr/ipc-echo.18`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc-echo.18) -> [`pr/ipc-echo.19`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc-echo.19), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/ipc-echo.18-rebase..pr/ipc-echo.19))\r\n",

Should it attempt any other system calls, the kernel will terminate the process with SIGKILL or SIGSYS. In this sense, it does not virtualize the system's resources but isolates the process from them entirely.\r\n>\r\n> […]\r\n> \r\n> seccomp-bpf is an extension to seccomp that allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy implemented using Berkeley Packet Filter rules. It is used by OpenSSH and vsftpd as well as the Google Chrome/Chromium web browsers on Chrome OS and Linux. (In this regard seccomp-bpf achieves similar functionality, but with more flexibility and higher performance, to the older systrace—which seems to be no longer supported for Linux.)",

This should speed up short RPC tests.\r\n\r\nThis change has been tried a few times before, but abandoned every time because solutions used a condition variable which is not safe for use in signals, as they need to be reentrant.\r\n\r\nOn UNIX-ish OSes, use a safe way: a pipe. When shutdown is requested write a dummy byte to the pipe. Waiting for shutdown is a matter of a blocking read from the pipe.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, there are no signals so using a condition variable is safe.\r\n\r\nThis only affects bitcoind. The GUI is unaffected by this change, and keeps polling as before in `BitcoinGUI::detectShutdown()`. It might be possible to listen to a pipe there, too, but I'm not sure, and it's complicated by the GUI-node abstraction.",

          "body": "Add I2P support by using the [I2P SAM](https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3) protocol. Unlike Tor, for incoming connections we get the I2P address of the peer (and they also receive ours when we are the connection initiator).\r\n\r\nTwo new options are added:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  -i2psam=<ip:port>\r\n       I2P SAM proxy to reach I2P peers and accept I2P connections (default:\r\n       none)\r\n\r\n  -i2pacceptincoming\r\n       If set and -i2psam is also set then incoming I2P connections are\r\n       accepted via the SAM proxy. If this is not set but -i2psam is set\r\n       then only outgoing connections will be made to the I2P network.\r\n       Ignored if -i2psam is not set. Notice that listening for incoming\r\n       I2P connections is done through the SAM proxy, not by binding to\r\n       a local address and port (default: true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Overview of the changes\r\n\r\n## Make `ReadBinary()` and `WriteBinary()` reusable\r\n\r\nWe would need to dump the I2P private key to a file and read it back later. Move those two functions out of `torcontrol.cpp`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nutil: extract {Read,Write}BinaryFile() to its own files\r\nutil: fix ReadBinaryFile() returning partial contents\r\nutil: fix WriteBinaryFile() claiming success even if error occurred\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Split `CConnman::AcceptConnection()`\r\n\r\nMost of `CConnman::AcceptConnection()` is agnostic of how the socket was accepted. The other part of it deals with the details of the `accept(2)` system call. Split those so that the protocol-agnostic part can be reused if we accept a socket by other means.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnet: check for invalid socket earlier in CConnman::AcceptConnection()\r\nnet: get the bind address earlier in CConnman::AcceptConnection()\r\nnet: isolate the protocol-agnostic part of CConnman::AcceptConnection()\r\nnet: avoid unnecessary GetBindAddress() call\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implement the I2P [SAM](https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3) protocol (not all of it)\r\n\r\nJust the parts that would enable us to make outgoing and accept incoming I2P connections.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnet: extend CNetAddr::SetSpecial() to support I2P\r\nnet: move the constant maxWait out of InterruptibleRecv()\r\nnet: dedup MSG_NOSIGNAL and MSG_DONTWAIT definitions\r\nnet: extend Sock::Wait() to report a timeout\r\nnet: extend Sock with methods for robust send & read until terminator\r\nnet: extend Sock with a method to check whether connected\r\nnet: implement the necessary parts of the I2P SAM protocol\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use I2P SAM to connect to and accept connections from I2P peers\r\n\r\nProfit from all of the preceding commits.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninit: introduce I2P connectivity options\r\nnet: add I2P to the reachability map\r\nnet: make outgoing I2P connections from CConnman\r\nnet: accept incoming I2P connections from CConnman\r\nnet: recognize I2P from ParseNetwork() so that -onlynet=i2p works\r\nnet: Do not skip the I2P network from GetNetworkNames()\r\n```",

These are customization points used for more complicated #10102 node/wallet/gui interactions not needed for the simple echo method call\r\n- I will to split up the main \"Add basic spawn and IPC support\" commit fe0a68197aed9f2df05ab3a051b3f3aa3f630e88 some more, particularly moving the long documentation comments out to a separate commit.

      "body": "Light Code-Review ACK e9f438870169e04edda15badf8c4d0f174e32970\r\n\r\nNit: I'm not 100% sure how to approach this, but perhaps there's a more ergonomic way to get the final interface out from `spawnProcess` than doing \"out-param-through-lamdba-capturing\"?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThanks to ryanofsky's offline help, I wrote down some notes on how this all works, hope it helps other reviewers (please also let me know if I got anything wrong!)\r\n\r\n### Parent's Perspective\r\n\r\nWhen a parent node starts up, it constructs (using `interfaces::MakeNodeInit`) an `interfaces::Init` that is placed in `NodeContext.init`. The parent node can then call `spawnProcess` on the newly constructed `interfaces::Init`'s `interfaces::Ipc` to:\r\n1. Start a child process\r\n2. Create an interface for the parent to communicate with said child\r\n\r\nThe default implementation for `interfaces::Ipc::spawnProcess` works by utilizing:\r\n1. `ipc::Process::connect`, which encapsulates the logic needed to \r\n\t1. Start the child process\r\n\t1. Create a protocol-neutral file descriptor for the parent to communicate with said child process\r\n1. `ipc::Protocol::connect`, which encapsulates the logic needed to\r\n\t1. Create an interface for the parent to communicate with said child from the protocol-neutral file descriptor\r\n\r\n### Child's perspective\r\n\r\nWhen the child is spawned by the parent calling `ipc::Process::connect` as described above, the child also calls `interfaces::MakeNodeInit` to construct an `interfaces::Init`.\r\n\r\nWhat's important here is that `interfaces::MakeNodeInit` calls `serveProcess` (yin to `spawnProcess`'s yang) on its newly constructed `interfaces::Init` before returning. This `serveProcess` behaves differently when called by a parent process vs. a child process:\r\n\r\n1. In the case of a parent process, this immediately returns false and the newly constructed `interfaces::Init` is placed in `NodeContext.init` for later use (described above).\r\n1. In the case of a spawned child process, this `serveProcess` will block, listen, and respond to calls from the parent process on a loop.\r\n\r\nNote: `serveProcess` distinguished between the parent vs. child by checking for an `-ipcfd` flag on the command line, which is added when a parent process spawns a child process in `ipc::Process::spawn`.\r\n\r\nThe default implementation for `interfaces::Ipc::serveProcess` work by utilizing:\r\n1. `ipc::Process::serve`, which encapsulates the logic needed to \r\n\t1. Parse the `-ipcfd` flag for the protocol-neutral file descriptor on which the parent will send requests\r\n\t1. Call `ipc::Protocol::serve`, which encapsulates the logic needed to\r\n\t\t1. Respond to requests from the parent process on said file descriptor\r\n\t1. Capture the correct exit status from `ipc::Protocol::serve` and bubble it up\r\n\r\nA few snippets that were elucidating for me:\r\n1.

          "body": "This adds a `-daemonwait` flag that does the same as `-daemon` except that it, from a user perspective, backgrounds the process only after initialization is complete. This is similar to the behaviour of some other software such as c-lightning.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful when the process launching bitcoind wants to guarantee that either the RPC server is running, or that initialization failed, before continuing. The exit code indicates the initialization result.\r\n\r\nThe use of the libc function `daemon()` is replaced by a custom implementation which is inspired by the [glibc implementation](https://github.com/lattera/glibc/blob/master/misc/daemon.c#L44), but which also creates a pipe from the child to the parent process for communication.\r\n\r\nAn additional advantage of having our own `daemon()` implementation is that no MACOS-specific pragmas are needed anymore to silence a deprecation warning.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Factor out `token_read` and `token_write` to an utility, and use  them in `shutdown.cpp` as well—this is exactly the same kind of communication mechanism.\r\n\r\n    - [x] RAII-ify pipe endpoints.\r\n\r\n- [x] Improve granularity of the `configure.ac` checks. This currently  still checks for the function `daemon()` which makes no sense as  it's not used. It should check for individual functions such as\r\n  `fork()` and `setsid()` etc—the former being required, the second optional.\r\n\r\n- [-] ~~Signal propagation during initialization: if say, pressing Ctrl-C during `-daemonwait` it would be good to pass this SIGINT on to the child process instead of detaching the parent process and letting the child run free.~~ This is not necessary, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21007#issuecomment-769007341.\r\n\r\nFuture:\r\n\r\n- Consider if it makes sense to use this in the RPC tests (there would be no more need for \"is RPC ready\" polling loops). I think this is out of scope for this PR.",

The [`Make` function declarations](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/5e55c5a29633c19df2008653bf9285b338ff1088/src/interfaces/init.h#L32-L44) at the bottom are meant to suggest the different init implementations.\r\n\r\nAlso, to be sure, `interfaces::Init` methods _could_ all be abstract. Making them not abstract just avoids having to repeatedly define the same `make` methods in subclasses that all return null. This avoids extra boilerplate in #10102 which has [`BitcoinNodeInit`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/init/bitcoin-node.cpp), [`BitcoinWalletInit`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/init/bitcoin-wallet-ipc.cpp), [`BitcoinGuiInit`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/init/bitcoin-gui.cpp), [`BitcoinQtInit`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/init/bitcoin-qt.cpp), and [`BitcoindInit`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/init/bitcoind.cpp)",

I'd like to give that a thorough read-through, and I think we should consider moving it in-tree going forward (apologies if that's resurrecting a discussion that was already hashed out).\r\n\r\nI'm going to build and test this locally and will report back with a more thorough review.\r\n\r\nThe code here is fairly simple and easy to follow, though I would recommend to reviewers that they read the documentation commit first (8e85076174) for some general context. Some of the classes and machinery are a little abstract and so benefit from some upfront background.\r\n\r\nI'd like to emphasize here that this is an important project; it's upstream of many changes that have the potential to substantially increase bitcoind's resilience (e.g. decoupling consensus runtime from extraneous functionality, pluggable alternate transports). For that reason I hope to see continued review effort here, and will try to do a better job of that myself! \r\n\r\n### Review notes\r\n\r\n- [x] 29e574aed8 Update libmultiprocess library\r\n\r\n    Changes out hash for a newer libmultiprocess.\r\n\r\n- [x] 0ffd07f870 multiprocess: Add Ipc and Init interface definitions\r\n\r\n    Adds some abstract interfaces for spawning and cleaning up processes (essentially\r\n    just wrappers around libmultiprocess machinery) as well as some specific init\r\n    interfaces for making node, chain, and wallet client processes.\r\n\r\n- [x] e4cda24487 multiprocess: Add Ipc interface implementation\r\n\r\n    CapnpProtocol() - an Capnp-transport-specific implementation that can enqueue IPC requests,\r\n    execute them, and communicate the results out to a file descriptor. \r\n\r\n- [x] c80a46c20f multiprocess: Add bitcoin-node process spawning support\r\n\r\n    Adds an `interfaces::Init` implementation for spawning a bitcoin node process.\r\n    Defines the headers for the wallet and GUI init implementations, but doesn't specify\r\n    the implementations for those.\r\n\r\n- [x] 8e85076174 multiprocess: Add comments and documentation\r\n \r\n    For anyone reviewing, probably worth reading this first.\r\n   \r\n- [x] b2abe3f062 multiprocess: Add echoipc RPC method and test\r\n\r\n    Nice commit that demonstrates implementations of a simple echo process that spawns\r\n    and services requests, as well as a system test which (I assume for the moment) runs\r\n    degenerately in a single process.\r\n",

I need to go through your feedback more and figure out how to update commit messages and documention.\r\n\r\n> I think we should consider moving it in-tree going forward (apologies if that's resurrecting a discussion that was already hashed out).\r\n\r\nI'd like to move the [libmultiprocess repo](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) from the [chaincode org](https://github.com/chaincode) to the [bitcoin-core org](https://github.com/bitcoin-core), but preferably not make it part of the [bitcoin repo](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin). There are a few reasons. One reason is that there's nothing bitcoin-specific about the project. It can be used by any c++ application or library that wants to easily call functions across processes or pass callable objects between processes. Another more petty reason is that it uses a modern build system which would be nice not to backport to autoconf. Would be doable though.\r\n\r\n> system test which (I assume for the moment) runs degenerately in a single process.\r\n\r\nYes, if you run [rpc_misc.py](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/test/functional/rpc_misc.py) by default it won't test multiprocess support because `bitcoind` doesn't have multiprocess support. But if you run `BITCOIND=bitcoin-node test/functional/rpc_misc.py`, the `bitcoin-node` process will spawn another `bitcoin-node` process internally to do the test. (Cirrus CI [tests this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/83bdbbd300bb17bef07bc63735a84a0b0ce59958/ci/test/00_setup_env_native_multiprocess.sh#L15) in its multiprocess build).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRebased b2abe3f062c69663ae97bed239aa0a118e6a081c -> e1d4b13d4ecb2755ed2bc33e1ed0ce6df393b90d ([`pr/ipc-echo.26`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc-echo.26) -> [`pr/ipc-echo.27`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc-echo.27), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/ipc-echo.26-rebase..pr/ipc-echo.27)) due to conflict with #20685",

      "body": "I've spent the last day or so reading through libmultiprocess (evidenced by [a few breadcrumbs](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/pull/45)) and while I feel I have lexically parsed the contents of that repo and have found nothing obviously wrong or malicious, I certainly wouldn't be able to recreate the work there and can't attest to its correctness. The contents of, say, [the type marshalling unit](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/master/include/mp/proxy-types.h) are out of my paygrade from a C++ knowhow standpoint so while the code *seems* fine (and certainly well designed by @ryanofsky), I cannot take a full accounting of its correctness or safety.\r\n\r\nThat said, `--enable-multiprocess` is still an opt-in, off-by-default feature and the approach taken using libmultiprocess is probably the least intrusive from a code standpoint in terms of mitigating the changes necessary to make multiprocess operation an option alongside the standard monolith process operation. Even if the approach taken in libmultiprocess is more general/complex than necessary in the longterm and even if we may be able to come up with a simpler mechanism to enable multiprocess coordination, I think getting multiprocess operation fleshed out and working is the really important thing at this point. So while I think it would be nice if some of the cpp gurus on this repo gave libmultiprocess a thorough once-over (if they haven't already), I am ACK on using that library to proof out process separation.\r\n\r\nOnce we get process separation working and thoroughly tested, we can think about whether the generalized mechanisms for object (de)serialization and function calling in libmultiprocess are necessary in lieu of something simpler like message passing with a more specialized, straightforward protocol over a socket.\r\n\r\nI hope to complete a final review and testing of this PR today.",

I think it can be improved by adding some documentation, also by removing c++11isms (#46), and maybe by making the code less repetitive (same code is pasted repeatedly to deal with raw pointers/shared pointers/unique pointers/optionals, tuples/pairs, map/list/set/vector).",

      "body": "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19160#issuecomment-800365092\r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing this and also taking the time to go through the guts of (it seems like the entire?) [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) library. I know it needs to be documented better, and I'm working on this. I started adding a standalone example program https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/pull/49 to show how the library is meant to be used without the added complexity of bitcoin integration in this PR. I don't necessarily know where things are more clear and less clear, and would encourage freely opening issues https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/new to suggest improvements, ask questions, or leave feedback. There's high level and low level documentation that I'm happy to write if it seems like someone will read it, and I know what to write about.\r\n\r\n> The contents of, say, [the type marshalling unit](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/master/include/mp/proxy-types.h?rgh-link-date=2021-03-16T15%3A30%3A45Z) are out of my paygrade from a C++ knowhow standpoint so while the code _seems_ fine (and certainly well designed by @ryanofsky), I cannot take a full accounting of its correctness or safety.\r\n\r\nI think this should be fixable, and filed https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/50 to track. The only thing the code actually does is assign input values to output values, but are there are a lot of ways this can happen in c++ with input & output arguments, return values, and emplaces, and a lot of types to make it work with. The code did sprawl over time supporting new usages and types, and I'm pretty sure it could be simpler.\r\n\r\n> libmultiprocess is more general/complex than necessary in the longterm and even if we may be able to come up with a simpler mechanism to enable multiprocess coordination, I think getting multiprocess operation fleshed out and working is the really important thing at this point.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, there's a tradeoff between how much C++ template magic you want to accept vs how much boilerplate you want to write when you add a new IPC method or parameter, and the current approach leans towards having more template magic and less boilerplate. The implications should be confined to the [`src/ipc/`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/ipc-export/src/ipc/) directory, though, so this is less significant than something like [`serialize.h`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/serialize.h) template magic which is used in many parts of the codebase. Also as mentioned https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102#issuecomment-790664616, it will always be possible to build bitcoin without any `src/ipc/` code whatsoever (it's not built unless you use `--enable-multiprocess`), and if you want to replace the current IPC implementation with a different IPC implementation you can write a [`interfaces::Ipc`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/interfaces/ipc.h) subclass with overridden `spawnProcess`, etc methods that don't use libmultiprocess.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRebased 36f1fbf50a0f2c96dfd1f7fe84d407f39a1906bd -> 6a2951a7c7690e4f974fb938e1434ca836762207 ([`pr/ipc-echo.28`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc-echo.28) -> [`pr/ipc-echo.29`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc-echo.29), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/ipc-echo.28-rebase..pr/ipc-echo.29)) due to conflict with #21007",

Built locally and did the `echoipc` test on a different machine than last ACK.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks for the detailed response, @ryanofsky. I guess this is sort of tantamount to the familiar issue of using an object-relational mapper vs. writing raw SQL. In the former case, client code is very simple and easy to read but there's good deal of generality and complexity in the underlying library; in the latter case there is a lot of rote code on the clientside but little ambiguity about what is happening under the covers.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm happy to do what I can to help improve libmultiprocess in the meantime and defer big discussions for IPC mechanism until multiprocess operation is humming along (in an opt-in way) with this architecture.

But this PR and #10102 are just adding an IPC implemention of existing interfaces. So if you wanted to drop a layer in the IPC stack, or change the IPC protocol, changes would be confined to `src/ipc/` and not affect anything outside.",

I have only scanned the rest of the code of libmultiprocess so far but plan to do more in depth review there until I review the follow-up this PR (FWIW, I will try to help out with the documentation on libmultiprocess while I get more into it). However, I have also scanned the generated files for the `echoipc` example and didn't see any issues there. I have build this PR with `--enable-multiprocess`, ran a testnet node with it over several days and tested the `echoipc` RPC multiple times, checking the generated logs.\r\n\r\nObviously, please ignore my very minor nits unless you have to retouch.\r\n\r\nNote for other reviewers: It helped me especially in this review to look at the commits in reverse order at least once, i.e. going from usage to implementation and lower-level stuff.",

I'll address the other comments, but just in case there is any question about `serve()` it's called in `main()` here in the `bitcoin-node` executable:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo.4/src/bitcoind.cpp#L178-L185\r\n\r\nand here in the `bitcoin-wallet` executable:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc.113/src/bitcoin-wallet.cpp#L80-L88\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to have a separate `bitcoin-echo` executable, it could have a `main()` function just like those examples. I didn't want to have a separate `bitcoin-echo` executable though, just because I thought it'd be confusing to have a kind of pointless `bitcoin-echo` program installed along with `bitcoin-gui` `bitcoin-node` and `bitcoin-wallet`, so I just put the echo functionality inside `bitcoin-node`.",

There is some documentation about the libmultiprocess implementation in [proxy.capnp's `ThreadMap`, `Thread` and `Context`](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/9f5b8355649aca94b4b529d89ba439aa3b2f9642/include/mp/proxy.capnp#L39-L61) descriptions.",

A `bitcoin-wallet` will never have such context ?\r\n\r\nAdded comment. This is called one place in [`AppInit()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/0602f87a085c733f1da38b3b82210c81ef018fd5/src/bitcoind.cpp#L48) in bitcoind, bitcoin-qt, and bitcoin-node processes that run node code. It is not called in bitcoin-wallet or bitcoin-gui processes that don't run node code. There will be a WalletContext returning method too but it's not needed in this PR because bitcoin-wallet tool doesn't currently do anything that requires a wallet context.",

Client process calls IpcProtocol::connect() passing the socketpair\n+//!    descriptor, which returns a client Init proxy object calling remote Init\n+//!    interface methods.\n+//! 3. Client process calls client Init proxy object methods to make new client\n+//!    proxy objects calling other remote interfaces. It can also destroy the\n+//!    Init object to shut down the spawned process.\n+//! 4.

Bitcoin GUI process is started, in `src/qt/bitcoin.cpp`, it initializes its own interface `LocalInit` from `src/interfaces/init_bitcoin-gui.cpp`\r\n2. From this `LocalInit` interface, it calls `makeNode()`, which trigger a child `bitcoin-node` spawning through `IpcProcess.spawn`. It also register hook cleaning through `base.addCloseHook`\r\n3. From this `LocalInit` interface, it calls `connect`, which start a new thread `capnp-loop` with a libmultiprocess `mp::EventLoop`\r\n4. Bitcoin Node is started with `-ipcfd` passing a socketpair for communications, it initializes its own interface `LocalInit` from `src/interfaces/init_bitcoin-node.cpp`\r\n5. From this `LocalInit` interface, it calls `serve()` to start servicing Bitcoin GUI on its owned interface `Chain`. This is achieved through the abstract interface `IpcProtocol` which is currently Cap'n Proto (`MakeCapnpProtocol`)\r\n6. When Bitcoin GUI request a `Chain` method like `hasBlocks`, this is redirected to `mp::ProxyClient`\r\n7. From its own `capnp-loop` thread embedding a `mp::ProxyServer`, Bitcoin Node internal methods are called to fulfill the request\r\n\r\nOkay it's likely a fuzzy walkthrough but this reflects my understanding right now.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about joining an ASCII art ? I can write one, but I don't know if graphical representation documentation has been favored by Core though it may be helpful for architecture-level stuff.",

      "body": "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19160#discussion_r505757544\r\n\r\n> It would be great to extend the README with a new section explaining how someone would add a new `IpcProtocol` implementation. As of right now `src/interfaces/capnp/init.capnp` is pretty empty which makes it hard to understand for reviewers without looking first on #10102 branch.\r\n\r\nI added an overview of the IPC implementation and more information about what happens when IPC methods are called in https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc-echo/doc/multiprocess.md#ipc-implementation-details.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what change is suggested by the observation about init.capnp. I hope it's clear that things in the `src/interfaces/capnp/` directory are specific to the capnp protocol. I hope it's also clear that c++ interfaces in the `src/interfaces/` and just abstract classes with pure virtual methods, and they can be implemented in any way to make calls with any protocol.\r\n\r\nThe IpcProtocol interface is a simple interface with 2 methods: `connect` and `serve` that is heavily documented and defined in src/interfaces/ipc.h. In #19460 a third `listen` method is  added to support listening for incoming connections on a socket, and not just communicating with the parent process.\r\n\r\n> Purely reading libmultiprocess README, I didn't grasp at first than one `IpcProtocol` must define a `ProxyClient`/ProxyServer` pair for each supported interface.\r\n\r\nIt's not the case that an IPC protocol needs to be implemented with pairs of client and server classes. The server classes that are generated are specific to capnp, and the Client class naming was also just chosen to be consistent with capnp names. If I were implementing a custom protocol, I wouldn't write any proxy server classes. I would write socket code that calls implementation methods directly, not socket code that calls proxy server class methods that call implementation class methods. If I were implementing a non-capnp protocol, I probably wouldn't use the client naming either. For example, if I were implementing a protocol for the `Wallet` interface, I'd make use of the existing `WalletImpl` class implementation in the local process and name the implementation that does remote IPC `RemoteWalletImpl`.",

The next sentence after the quote in your comment says how the interface is used connecting to another process, so I don't know how I would emphasize the point more.\r\n\r\nAlso, _every_ interface in `src/interfaces/` is called across process boundaries. From https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#internal-interface-guidelines: \"Interface classes are written in a particular style so node, wallet, and GUI code doesn't need to run in the same process\" \r\n\r\nAlso, there is nothing special about the `Init` interface returning pointers to other interfaces. `Node` and `Wallet` and `Chain` interface methods all return pointers to other interfaces as well.\r\n\r\nThe only special thing about the `Init` interface is that it is the _first_ interface pointer you get access to when you make a connection to a process. It's the initial interface.\r\n\r\n> * \"providing virtual methods that can be called from other processes\", AFAIU, this is confusing as interfaces::Init provides both process control method (e.g `makeEchoIpc()`, in the future `makeWallet`) and an interface `IpcProtocol` wrapping a libmultiprocess `ProxyClient/ProxyServer`. I would be better to document that both control and data exchange functions are supported by interfaces::Init\r\n\r\nCould you be more specific about what should be documented? This comment seems to be referring to `LocalInit` methods not `Init` methods. The `Init` methods are `makeEcho`, `makeNode`, `makeChain`, and `makeWalletClient`. These are all methods called to get access to other interfaces.\r\n\r\n`LocalInit` is a different class from `Init`. It's a connector between `src/init` code and IPC code. It could be broken up or renamed, but I'd be reluctant to make changes without knowing specific design goals.\r\n\r\n> Overall, I still think `Init`/`LocalInit` are loosely-defining names. The names doesn't indicate what is initiated nor who is local and remote. `IPCSupervisor`/`IPCWrapper` as suggested would be better.\r\n\r\nThere is no special supervision or wrapping happening in the `Init` interface that isn't happening in all the other interfaces (Node/Wallet/Chain) when IPC is enabled. The only unique thing about the `Init` interface is that it is the first, initial interface that a process gets access to before it can access other interfaces it actually wants to use. Other reasonable names for `interfaces::Init` might be `interfaces::Initial` or `interfaces::Factory` or `interfaces::Process` or `interfaces::Global`.\r\n\r\nThe `LocalInit` class is different than the `Init` class. For one thing it is an actual class with implemented methods and not a pure interface. Maybe it could be called `interfaces::InitImpl` or `interfaces::Startup` or `interfaces::LocalProcess`. Maybe it could be structured differently or not inherit from `Init`.\r\n\r\nI do think neither `Init` nor `LocalInit` classes should contain `IPC` in their names, because it would be misleading in places where they are not implemented to use IPC. The `LocalInit` class is used in startup in code in `src/init`, `src/wallet/`, `and src/qt/` to create initial interfaces pointers whether or not there is any IPC. In `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` binaries where there is no IPC, the `LocalInit` implementations do not contain IPC code and they don't do any supervision or wrapping, so naming these `IPCSupervisor`/`IPCWrapper` would be more misleading than illuminating.",

IMO, three further improvements to make it better:\r\n* rename `IpcProtocolImpl` to `CapnpProtocol`, the constructor is already called `MakeCapnpProtocol` and `IpcProcessImpl` to `LibmpProcess`. Or any more accurate names hinting the _specific_ implementation\r\n* document `IpcProtocol`/`IpcProcess` in `src/interfaces/README.md`, underscoring the current available implementation `IpcProtocolImpl`/`IpcProcessImpl` for each of them\r\n* reorganize directory to `src/interfaces/capnp/` `src/interfaces/ipcproto/capnp` underscoring that capnp is only one implementation among potential several ones.\r\n\r\n> It's not the case that an IPC protocol needs to be implemented with pairs of client and server classes. \r\n\r\nI did looked again on the #10102 and this point is more straightforward to understand.

Or any more accurate names hinting the _specific_ implementation\r\n\r\nRenamed `CapnpProtocol`, but kept `ProcessImpl` because the process implementation happens to make a few libmultiprocess helper calls but is not focused around libmultiprocess (it could call fork/exec instead of mp::SpawnProcess for example). It might help to look at the complete `ProcessImpl` class in https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/ipc/process.cpp which supports establishing connections between existing processes instead of just basic spawning implemented here.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of renaming `ProcessImpl` to `UnixProcess` and having an alternate `WindowsProcess` implementation, and maybe I will do this but currently I'm not sure how much platform specific code there will be here. It's possible more platform specific code will move into libmultiprocess and then it would make sense to call this `LibmpProcess`. But if there are significant differences between unix sockets and windows pipes, having two classes instead of one would make more sense. For now ProcessImpl like NodeImpl ChainImpl WalletImpl is pretty straightforward, I think.\r\n\r\n> * document `IpcProtocol`/`IpcProcess` in `src/interfaces/README.md`, underscoring the current available implementation `IpcProtocolImpl`/`IpcProcessImpl` for each of them\r\n\r\nIPC classes are moved out of `src/interfaces/` to `src/ipc/` so hopefully this is clearer. I think all the classes have pretty good doxygen documentation and organization is straightforward. `src/ipc/` is just a normal directory like `src/wallet/` or `src/qt/` grouping related classes and functions.\r\n\r\n> * reorganize directory to `src/interfaces/capnp/` `src/interfaces/ipcproto/capnp` underscoring that capnp is only one implementation among potential several ones.\r\n\r\nThanks, renamed to `src/ipc/capnp/`\r\n\r\n> > It's not the case that an IPC protocol needs to be implemented with pairs of client and server classes.\r\n> \r\n> I did looked again on the #10102 and this point is more straightforward to understand. That said, for this current PR, I believe it will helper reviewers to make a reference on how pairs of clients and server are added for capnp implementation.\r\n\r\nNow eliminated more uses of \"client classes\", switching to \"proxy classes\" instead. The client/server terminology is more specific to capnp and less helpful to talk about generically. In particular proxy server classes are a capnp-specific detail and I doubt a different protocol implementation would even have wrapper classes on the server side.\r\n\r\n> I don't know if a `src/interfaces/capnp/README.md` with implementation details would help but for example I still don't grasp how `.capnp` files are consumed by the code generator. I might need to read `libmultiprocess/README.md` more attentively though.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be helpful to describe generated files. This is a low level detail, though, and not something you need to care about implementing an IPC interface or calling one. The idea is that to call an interface from a different process, all you need to do is describe it, and the proxy code is generated from the description. The generated files should be easy to browse and are all named like `src/ipc/capnp/*.capnp.*`\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19160#issuecomment-718103715\r\n\r\n> @ryanofsky See my graphical representation proposal here : [https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/tree/ipc-echo-review/src/interfaces](https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/tree/ipc-echo-review/src/interfaces?rgh-link-date=2020-10-28T17%3A49%3A34Z)..\r\n> \r\n> Joint with a walk-through for both the interfaces initialization and a message round-trip.\r\n\r\nI don't know actually how to understand that diagram. I don't know what the arrows mean, and I'm not sure it's good for it to mix low level and high level details together. For example, the capnp event loop thread seems a low-level implementation detail. I'm not sure why you would care if you're just connecting or calling a proxy method whether capnp does the socket communication on the calling thread or a different event loop thread.\r\n\r\nBut I wouldn't be opposed to including a diagram like this as an illustration if it's helpful",

Any other case should be a hint of an error in `bitcoin-node usage ? \r\n\r\nIf `bitcoin-node` behavior is only regular when it's called with `ipcfd`, why this comment is saying \"If the argv indicates that this is child process...then returns null and a status code to exit with ? To me, this is expected behavior and shouldn't be subject to early exit.\r\n\r\nFurther, the code sounds to do something different.\r\n\r\nIf this process is called without `ipcfd`, `ProcessImpl::serve` will returns false, the same for `IpcImpl` and finally `MakeNodeInit` will return a `init::BitcoinNodeInit`  to main, pursuing process operations further. \r\n\r\nIf this process is called with `ipcfd` with an valid fd, `ProcessImpl::serve` will return true, the same for `IpcImpl::serveProcess` and finally `MakeNodeInit` will return a `nullptr` to main, provoking early exit of the process. Note, the return values are the same if the `ipcfd` is called with an invalid fd.\r\n\r\nI think this comment should detail what's a valid invocation of `bitcoin-node`, the pathological cases and what `MakeNodeInit` will return for each.",

Maybe there is something misleading about the word spawn? The naming here comes from the POSIX spawn API (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/posix_spawn.3.html). Any process that spawns another process is a parent, and any process that is spawned is a child. A process can be both a parent and a child. When `bitcoin-gui` spawns `bitcoin-node` which spawns `bitcoin-wallet` in #10102, `bitcoin-node` is a both a parent and a child.",

As much as possible, calls between processes are meant to work the same as calls within a single process without adding limitations or requiring extra implementation effort. Processes communicate with each other by calling regular [C++ interface methods](../src/interfaces/README.md). Method arguments and return values are automatically serialized and sent between processes. Object references and `std::function` arguments are automatically tracked and mapped to allow invoked code to call back into invoking code at any time, and there is a 1:1 threading model where any thread invoking a method in another process has a corresponding thread in the invoked process responsible for executing all method calls from the source thread, without blocking I/O or holding up another calls, and using the same thread local variables, locks, and callbacks between calls. The forwarding, tracking, and threading is implemented inside the [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) library which has the design goal of making calls between processes look exactly like calls in the same process to the extent possible.",

Any other case should be a hint of an error in `bitcoin-node usage ?\r\n\r\nI think all of this should be more clear after #10102, but `bitcoin-node` is a drop-in replacement for `bitcoind` that just uses multiple processes internally instead of a single process. `bitcoin-node` takes all the same arguments that `bitcoind` takes and can be used in the same ways. (It also gains a new `-ipcbind` argument in #19460.)\r\n\r\nIf `bitcoin-node` is started with `-ipcfd=$FD`, it's not a normal invocation, but it's not a \"pathological case\" either. It's just a special invocation that lets the `interfaces::Ipc::startSpawnedProcess()` method detect if it's being called from a spawned process.",

The configure script will be able to locate the installed packages via [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/). See [Installation](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess#installation) section of the libmultiprocess readme for install steps.

These are C++ classes which follow\n+[conventions](developer-notes.md#internal-interface-guidelines), like passing\n+serializable arguments so they can be called from different processes, and\n+making methods pure virtual so they can have proxy implementations that forward\n+calls between processes.\n+\n+When Wallet, Node, and Chain code is running in the same process, calling any\n+interface method invokes the implementation directly. When code is running in\n+different processes, calling an interface method invokes a proxy interface\n+implementation that communicates with a remote process and invokes the real\n+implementation in the remote process. The\n+[libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) code\n+generation tool internally generates proxy client classes and proxy server\n+classes for this purpose that are thin wrappers around Cap'n Proto\n+[client](https://capnproto.org/cxxrpc.html#clients) and\n+[server](https://capnproto.org/cxxrpc.html#servers) classes, which handle the\n+actual serialization and socket communication.\n+\n+## Design",

      "body": "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19160#discussion_r584369949\r\n\r\n> this code _isn't_ autogenerated, right?\r\n\r\nRight, [`echo.capnp`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/ipc/capnp/echo.capnp) isn't a generated file, it's the source of generated files: echo.capnp.h, echo.capnp.cpp, [and so on](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/b2abe3f062c69663ae97bed239aa0a118e6a081c/src/Makefile.am#L822-L829). Generated files aren't committed to git, they are just build outputs.\r\n\r\nFor an interface to be shared across processses, it needs two definitions:\r\n\r\n- An **API definition** declaring how the interface is called. Examples: [node.h](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/interfaces/node.h), [wallet.h](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/interfaces/wallet.h), [echo.h](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/interfaces/echo.h), [init.h](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/interfaces/init.h)\r\n\r\n- A **data definition** declaring how interface calls get sent across the wire. Examples: [node.capnp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/ipc/capnp/node.capnp), [wallet.capnp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/ipc/capnp/wallet.capnp), [echo.capnp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/ipc/capnp/echo.capnp), [init.capnp](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export/src/ipc/capnp/init.capnp)\r\n\r\nSince API and data definitions contain some of the same information, they have to be kept in sync manually when methods or parameters change. This is designed to be _straightforward_ and _safe_. _Straightforward_ because there is no need to write manual serialization code or use awkward intermediate types like [`UniValue`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/univalue/include/univalue.h) instead of native types. _Safe_ because if there are any inconsistencies  between API and data definitions (even minor ones like using a narrow int data type for a wider int API input), there are errors at build time instead of errors or bugs at runtime.\r\n\r\nIn the future, it would be possible to combine API and data definitions together using [C++ attributes](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes). To do this we would add attributes to the API definition files, and then generate the data definitions from the API definitions and attributes. I didn't take this approach mostly because it would be extra work, but also because until c++ standardizes reflection, this would require either hooking into compiler APIs like https://github.com/RosettaCommons/binder, or parsing c++ code manually like http://www.swig.org/.\r\n\r\nI'll think about where I can document this stuff better. There's a https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/#example section where some of this may be appropriate.\r\n",

E.g `makeEcho` only on `BitcoinNodeInit` or `makeNode` only on `BitcoinGuiInit` ? What purpose does it serve to have default methods ?\r\n\r\nThis is mainly for #10102. Having default methods avoids the need to implement 20 make overrides in #10102 that would mostly return null (20 = 4 make methods * 5 init classes). In this PR there are only 2 init classes, but #10102 adds more. As examples it would be tedious to force `bitcoin-wallet` init class to implement `makeNode` and `makeChain` methods or force `bitcoin-gui` init class to implement `makeWalletClient` and other make methods.\r\n\r\nIn general it is good to avoid default methods, because they can mask problems and be confusing, but in this case I think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",

The configure script will be able to locate the installed packages via [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/). See [Installation](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess#installation) section of the libmultiprocess readme for install steps.

These are C++ classes which follow\n+[conventions](developer-notes.md#internal-interface-guidelines), like passing\n+serializable arguments so they can be called from different processes, and\n+making methods pure virtual so they can have proxy implementations that forward\n+calls between processes.\n+\n+When Wallet, Node, and Chain code is running in the same process, calling any\n+interface method invokes the implementation directly. When code is running in\n+different processes, calling an interface method invokes a proxy interface\n+implementation that communicates with a remote process and invokes the real\n+implementation in the remote process. The\n+[libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) code\n+generation tool internally generates proxy client classes and proxy server\n+classes for this purpose that are thin wrappers around Cap'n Proto\n+[client](https://capnproto.org/cxxrpc.html#clients) and\n+[server](https://capnproto.org/cxxrpc.html#servers) classes, which handle the\n+actual serialization and socket communication.\n+\n+As much as possible, calls between processes are meant to work the same as\n+calls within a single process without adding limitations or requiring extra\n+implementation effort. Processes communicate with each other by calling regular\n+[C++ interface methods](../src/interfaces/README.md). Method arguments and\n+return values are automatically serialized and sent between processes. Object\n+references and `std::function` arguments are automatically tracked and mapped\n+to allow invoked code to call back into invoking code at any time, and there is\n+a 1:1 threading model where any thread invoking a method in another process has\n+a corresponding thread in the invoked process responsible for executing all\n+method calls from the source thread, without blocking I/O or holding up another\n+calls, and using the same thread local variables, locks, and callbacks between",

Will think about it more for #10102. Unclear if these should be configurable, maybe at build time or run time. Also, the exe names in these init files are just used for thread naming and logging and could potentially be eliminated, while the exe names used in spawnProcess calls are used to actually build command lines, so might be more important.",
