    "body": "This patch  replaces #18120, fixing some regressions or issues with that PR. The overall change here should be easier to review as well.\r\n\r\nRefactors UpdateForDescendants to use Epochs instead of sets to de-duplicate traversal, and replaces the cache entries with a vector instead of a set. This is a straightforward win. The algorithm is a bit clever so as not to require two separate vectors for txiters that need expanding and txiters that have already been processed, but I think it's relatively easy to reason about.\r\n\r\nThis is extracted from #18063 as a standalone because it turns out the DoS issues with this code perhaps merit more extensive review http://gnusha.org/bitcoin-core-dev/2020-02-11.log. That PR will stay open for review, but this PR is designed as an \"obviously better\" win that can be merged now to keep progress up on the mempool project.\r\n\r\nsdaftuar can you re-run your bench from #18120?",

      "body": "Thanks @hebasto, I've been running your benchmarks all day long on a 2012 MacBookPro that seems to run them 6x slower than you :). Results here when it's done.\r\n\r\nInitial results for 12 runs on a more recent Debian laptop were showing 1-3% improvement on average but with quite a bit more variance than you, for this PR rebased on master versus master. Not statistically significant given the wide variance in results, which is why I offloaded a longer benchmarking to the older computer that is also doing nothing else.",

      "body": "Thanks all for running and developing these benches!\r\n\r\n@jonatack \r\n\r\nI think the thing to look at is that this is being done for a bunch of reasons that encapsulate performance more than just run time on a bench mark. If the run time is similar on a given bench that's a very favorable outcome for this patch. If it's better, that's great.\r\n\r\nBut this is ultimately more about DoS surface than sheer performance -- even if this algorithm were *slower* on benches but guaranteed to perform within a better asymptotic it would be an improvement over the current code.\r\n\r\nWith this patch we allocate way less memory. So the maximally bad block (which it's unclear if @hebasto's bench is maximally bad) is improved. Profilers should also look at the allocation differences between runs of master and this PR. Back of the envelope in this PR we make N allocations of size N, v.s. N^2 allocations of size 1. At too small N, the N of size N will look the same or worse, but getting rid of a N^2 path is very desirable.",

Generally this one is supposed to be an obviously better version that doesn't really require much benching. You can easily see from the code that std::sets go to vectors and a std::set of all conflicts is removed. But it's a good standard to hold to I suppose to want benches/testing for this stuff even if it seems obvious -- but as @MarcoFalke points out, benching memory is a bit tricky...\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar do you think any of the benches you've run previously can be published in a reproducible way?",

Or it's still under the whole Epoch mempool goal to support more complex packages ?\r\n\r\nYou should mention performance improvements in commit message, namely adding an epoch on descendants traversal to avoid duplicate and swap-in std::vector against std::set to remove the O(log n) at element insertion and argue why that's an improvement. Wrt to std::vector, is this also an improvement memory-size ? You can also spread them on 2 different commits to ease review.\r\n\r\nOverall, maybe you should come with a benchmark suite with package payloads of different complexity to avoid hitting hidden performance regressions ? I don't think `mempool_updatefromblock` has been designed for this.",

      "body": "Github won't let me leave a comment up at line 106, so I'm leaving it here.  I think the change in this commit of trying to not include things in `exclude` is broken, because it's possible you'll have a cache entry hit for something that is excluded, and then because things that are in the cache get swapped at line 106 to an entry in the vector that `already_traversed` is advanced past, you'll never pop it before you get down to this loop.\r\n\r\nI tend to think that this improvement to leaving things out from exclude isn't worth it; seems like quite a bit of added complexity to this logic without an obvious performance improvement.",

The right solution seems to be to annotate somehow that txiter is a copyable type. How can this be done?",
