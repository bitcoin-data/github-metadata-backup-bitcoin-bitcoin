    "body": "Start the rate-limiter with 5 tokens instead of 1 token.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn some occasions, a peer will send us addresses a few seconds after the connection is established. As peers start with token=1 and only get an additional token only every 10 seconds, some of these addresses might be rate-limited. The following log snippet contains an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n04:12:02 [net] Added connection to [redacted] peer=1234\r\n...\r\n04:12:03 [net] Received addr: 1 addresses (1 processed, 0 rate-limited) from peer=1234\r\n04:12:34 [net] Received addr: 4 addresses (3 processed, 1 rate-limited) from peer=1234\r\n04:13:09 [net] Received addr: 2 addresses (2 processed, 0 rate-limited) from peer=1234\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe peer starts with token=1 and uses one for its self-announcement at 04:12:03. Until the next addr message arrives at 04:12:34, it re-gains 3 tokens and uses them, however, the fourth address in this addr message is rate-limited. At 04:13:09, the peer has token=3 and uses 2.\r\n\r\nThis change gives peers token=5 to start with. To choose this value, I looked at the address relay of freshly connected peers. The data was sampled from the debug.logs from different nodes. It appears, that only very few peers require more than 5 initial tokens.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1172\" height=\"838\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19fbe866-c604-4508-889c-d9600990726e\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nBy increasing the initial tokens to 5, someone could connect, send 5 addresses, disconnect, and repeat to spam the node with addresses. Previously, the same was possible but only one address was processed. I don't think this is a problem anymore since #30568.\r\n\r\n",

As peers start with token=1 and only\nget an additional token only every 10 seconds, some of these\naddresses might be rate-limited. The following log snippet contains\nan example:\n\n```\n04:12:02 [net] Added connection to [redacted] peer=1234\n...\n04:12:03 [net] Received addr: 1 addresses (1 processed, 0 rate-limited) from peer=1234\n04:12:34 [net] Received addr: 4 addresses (3 processed, 1 rate-limited) from peer=1234\n04:13:09 [net] Received addr: 2 addresses (2 processed, 0 rate-limited) from peer=1234\n```\n\nThe peer starts with token=1 and uses one for its self-announcement at\n04:12:03. Until the next addr message arrives at 04:12:34, it re-gains\n3 tokens and uses them, however, the fourth address in this addr\nmessage is rate-limited. At 04:13:09, the peer has token=3 and uses 2.\n\nThis change gives peers token=5 to start with. To choose this value, I\nlooked at the address relay of freshly connected peers. The data was\nsampled from the debug.logs from different nodes. It appears, that only\nvery few peers require more than 5 initial tokens.\n\n(see image in PR)\n\nBy increasing the initial tokens to 5, someone could connect, send 5\naddresses, disconnect, and repeat to spam the node with addresses.\nPreviously, the same was possible but only one address was processed.\nI don't think this is a problem since we have #30568.\n",

      "body": "> I wonder what's going on with those peers above and to the left of the staircase?\r\n\r\nIt can happen that a (Bitcoin Core) peer sends us an addr message with more than X entries by random chance. Observed from  the logs I looked at:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchance >= 1 entries \t 100.00%\r\nchance >= 2 entries \t 37.62%\r\nchance >= 3 entries \t 19.14%\r\nchance >= 4 entries \t 10.16%\r\nchance >= 5 entries \t 5.66%\r\nchance >= 6 entries \t 3.28%\r\nchance >= 7 entries \t 1.98%\r\nchance >= 8 entries \t 1.25%\r\nchance >= 9 entries \t 0.81%\r\nchance >= 10 entries \t 0.55%\r\nchance >= 11 entries \t 0.39%\r\nchance >= 12 entries \t 0.28%\r\nchance >= 13 entries \t 0.21%\r\nchance >= 14 entries \t 0.16%\r\nchance >= 15 entries \t 0.13%\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo there's a 3.28% chance that a peer sends us a addr message with more than 5 addr. If this message arrives <10s after connection open, the peer does not have enough token yet. However, it's also unlikely that we choose to relay >5 addresses to this peer in <10s.\r\n\r\nThis is a hand-picked example from a peer (that claims to be v29.0) that sent some larger addr messages early on:\r\n\r\n```\r\n01:08:43 [net] Added connection to X peer=9668\r\n01:09:05 [msghand] Received addr: 8 addresses (3 processed, 5 rate-limited) from peer=9668\r\n01:10:25 [msghand] Received addr: 11 addresses (8 processed, 3 rate-limited) from peer=9668\r\n01:10:48 [msghand] Received addr: 3 addresses (2 processed, 1 rate-limited) from peer=9668\r\n01:11:38 [msghand] Received addr: 9 addresses (5 processed, 4 rate-limited) from peer=9668\r\n01:12:13 [msghand] Received addr: 3 addresses (3 processed, 0 rate-limited) from peer=9668\r\n01:13:09 [msghand] Received addr: 8 addresses (6 processed, 2 rate-limited) from peer=9668\r\n01:13:55 [msghand] Received addr: 2 addresses (2 processed, 0 rate-limited) from peer=9668\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's an overview of the number addr message entries peers send to me and were processed or rate-limited. Nearly all of the rate-limited entries were send in the first 60 seconds. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1381\" height=\"984\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53c0a1a4-14f5-4de3-8647-819c73072fe5\" />\r\n",
