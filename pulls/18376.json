Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

      "body": "@practicalswift I don't think it is helpful to call this premature optimization. This was not an optimization attempt. `GetConsensus` returns a const reference because this global is assumed to be initialized once and then never changed. It has been that way for years, and I presume well known by myself and all reviewers of the pull. See also bd006110fb51f1fc0cbbeef3ed6eaae66b296d8c. And logically, it wouldn't make sense for a running Bitcoin Core instance to change the consensus rules \"on the fly\" in a running process.\r\n\r\nI think it was reasonable to keep it a reference and pass it along in the scheduler. And I assume the four people who reviewed my pull request agreed with me.\r\n\r\nThat some unit tests spin up a PeerLogicValidation and then change the consensus parameters while running is documented as a temporary hack in the test code. And the oversight was that not everyone had this temporary hack in mind while writing/reviewing the code.",
