Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

      "body": "@practicalswift I don't think it is helpful to call this premature optimization. This was not an optimization attempt. `GetConsensus` returns a const reference because this global is assumed to be initialized once and then never changed. It has been that way for years, and I presume well known by myself and all reviewers of the pull. See also bd006110fb51f1fc0cbbeef3ed6eaae66b296d8c. And logically, it wouldn't make sense for a running Bitcoin Core instance to change the consensus rules \"on the fly\" in a running process.\r\n\r\nI think it was reasonable to keep it a reference and pass it along in the scheduler. And I assume the four people who reviewed my pull request agreed with me.\r\n\r\nThat some unit tests spin up a PeerLogicValidation and then change the consensus parameters while running is documented as a temporary hack in the test code. And the oversight was that not everyone had this temporary hack in mind while writing/reviewing the code.",

It just supports the discussion on the issue.\r\n\r\nBackground: Among all the Travis shenanigans the last two days I noticed that one of my PRs did not run the Travis check at all. However, when Appveyor succeeded [the PR appeared to be ready to merge, since all checks passed](https://imgur.com/a/Jb0oj45). I am not sure if it could have actually been merged at this point but the Github UI definitely suggests it and that seems to be easy to miss. A few hours later when Travis came back it appears that the Travis check ran then.\r\n\r\nThrough the Github checks API it would be possible to check that all checks have run and passed. The code here is just a rough draft of how this can work. At the moment the checks API appears to not respond with any actual data.",
