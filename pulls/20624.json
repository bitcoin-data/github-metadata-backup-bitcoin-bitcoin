    "body": "nStartingHeight was introduced in commit 7a47324c7 (Bitcoin version\r\n0.2.9, P2P version 209) with the comment \"better prevention of inventory\r\nrelaying during initial download\". At that time, there was no function\r\nto determine whether the node was still in Initial Block Download, so to\r\nprevent syncing nodes from relaying old blocks to their peers, a check\r\nwas added to never relay a block to a peer where the height was lower\r\nthan 2000 less than the peer's best block. That check was updated\r\nseveral times in later commits to ensure that we weren't relaying blocks\r\nbefore the latest checkpoint if the peer didn't provide a\r\nstartingheight. The checkpoint comparison was changed to compare with an\r\nestimate of the highest block in commit eae82d8e.\r\n\r\nIn commit 202e0194, all block relay was gated on being out of Initial\r\nBlock Download. In commit 0278fb5f, the comparison to nBlockEstimate was\r\nremoved since \"we already checked IsIBD()\".\r\n\r\nWe can remove the check against nStartingHeight entirely. If the node is\r\nout of Initial Block Download, then its tip height must have been within\r\n24 hours of current time, so should not be more than ~144 blocks behind\r\nthe most work tip.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies moving block inventory state into the `Peer` object (#19829).",

      "message": "[net processing] Remove nStartingHeight check from block relay\n\nnStartingHeight was introduced in commit 7a47324c7 (Bitcoin version\n0.2.9, P2P version 209) with the comment \"better prevention of inventory\nrelaying during initial download\". At that time, there was no function\nto determine whether the node was still in Initial Block Download, so to\nprevent syncing nodes from relaying old blocks to their peers, a check\nwas added to never relay a block to a peer where the height was lower\nthan 2000 less than the peer's best block. That check was updated\nseveral times in later commits to ensure that we weren't relaying blocks\nbefore the latest checkpoint if the peer didn't provide a\nstartingheight. The checkpoint comparison was changed to compare with an\nestimate of the highest block in commit eae82d8e.\n\nIn commit 202e0194, all block relay was gated on being out of Initial\nBlock Download. In commit 0278fb5f, the comparison to nBlockEstimate was\nremoved since \"we already checked IsIBD()\".\n\nWe can remove the check against nStartingHeight entirely. If the node is\nout of Initial Block Download, then its tip height must have been within\n24 hours of current time, so should not be more than ~144 blocks behind\nthe most work tip.",

One of the criteria for initial block download is `m_chain.Tip()->GetBlockTime() < (GetTime() - nMaxTipAge`, i.e. the new block is less than 24 hours old. The most likely reason for a new node to be more than 2000 blocks ahead of us, is if we are in IBD, so in that case the check was indeed redundant.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for a node to be 2000 bocks ahead of us is if they know a longer chain. In that case they won't care about our header announcements (which we now start sending it), but won't punish us either afaik.",

      "body": "Block announcement seems quirky currently. For example, if a node hasn't requested headers announcements, then we'll not announce blocks invs to nodes that have indicated they have the block, but if they have requested headers announcements, then we'll announce headers to them whether they have the block or not! And also, if we have a lot of headers to announce, then we'll revert to announcing via block invs!\r\n\r\nThe behaviour seems to change over the years without any obvious discussion on github as to why. I think ideally we ought not to be sending headers of a block to nodes that have already sent us the same header - seems kinda pointless to me - if the intention is to let them know what our latest block is, then sending them a block inv would use less bandwidth.",
