    "body": "Closes #17862\r\n\r\nContext from [original comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17862#issuecomment-744285188) (minor edits):\r\n\r\n`RewindBlockIndex()` is a mechanism to allow nodes to be upgraded after segwit activation, while still keeping their chainstate/datadir in a consistent state. It works as follows:\r\n\r\n- A pre-segwit (i.e. v0.13.0 or older) node is running.\r\n-  Segwit activates. The pre-segwit node remains sync'ed to the tip, but is not enforcing the new segwit rules.\r\n- The user upgrades the node to a segwit-aware version (v0.13.1 or newer).\r\n- On startup, in `AppInitMain()`, `RewindBlockIndex()` is called. This walks the chain backwards from the tip, disconnecting and erasing blocks that from after segwit activation that weren't validated with segwit rules.\r\n- those blocks are then redownloaded (with witness data) and validated with segwit rules.\r\n\r\nThis logic probably isn't required any more since:\r\n\r\n- Segwit activated at height 481824, when the block chain was 130GB and the total number of txs was 250 million. Today, we're at height 667704, the blockchain is over 315GB and the total number of txs is over 600 million. Even if 20% of that added data is witness data (a high estimate), then around 150GB of transactions would need to be rewound to get back to segwit activation height. It'd probably be faster to simply validate from genesis, especially since we won't be validating any scripts before the assumevalid block. It's also unclear whether rewinding 150GB of transactions would even work. It's certainly never been tested.\r\n- Bitcoin Core v0.13 is hardly used any more. https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html shows less than 50 nodes running it. The software was EOL on Aug 1st 2018. It's very unlikely that anyone is running 0.13 and will want to upgrade to 0.22.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `NeedsRedownload()` which merely checks for insufficiently validated segwit blocks and requests that the user restarts the node with `-reindex`. Reindexing the block files upon restart will make the node rebuild chain state and block index from the `blk*.dat` files on disk. The node won't be able to index the blocks with `BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS`, so they will be missing from the chain and be re-downloaded, with witness data.\r\n\r\nRemoving this code allows the following (done in follow-up #21090):\r\n\r\n- removal of tests using `segwitheight=-1` in `p2p_segwit.py`.\r\n- in turn, that allows us to drop support for `-segwitheight=-1`, which is only supported for that test.\r\n- that allows us to always set `NODE_WITNESS` in our local services. The only reason we don't do that is to support `-segwitheight=-1`.\r\n- that in turn allows us to drop all of the `GetLocalServices() & NODE_WITNESS` checks inside `net_processing.cpp`, since our local services would always include `NODE_WITNESS`\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "Compact blocks are used for efficient relay of blocks, either through High Bandwidth or Low Bandwidth mode. See [BIP 152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki) for full details.\r\n\r\nFor compact block relay to work, the receiver must have a mempool containing transactions which are likely to be included in the block. The receiver uses these transactions to reconstruct the block from the short transaction ids included in the `cmpctblock` message. Compact blocks are therefore only useful for relaying blocks at or near the tip of the block chain. For older blocks, the recipient won't have the transactions in their mempool and so would need to request them using a `getblocktxn` message. In such cases, just requesting the full block is more efficient.\r\n\r\nBIP 152 supports two versions: version 1 (without witnesses) and version 2 (with witnesses). Version 2 is required to reconstruct segwit blocks. Segwit was activated in August 2017, and providing non-witness blocks to peers is no longer useful. Since the witnesses are not included, the peer would not be able to fully validate all the consensus rules on the provided block.\r\n\r\nTherefore, stop supporting version 1 compact blocks. Ignore `sendcmpct` messages with version=1, and don't advertise support by sending `sendcmpct` with version=1. Only send `sendcmpct` to peers with `NODE_WITNESS`. Respond to all requests for compact blocks or blocktxns with witness-serialized blocks and transactions.",

This ensures that the code is race-free (with regards to blocks) when the tests pass once, instead of our current approach where the code can never be guaranteed to be race-free.",

We get clearer visibility into what currently lies in consensus codepaths **and** what depends on our consensus engine\r\n> 1. We can coalesce duplicate consensus initialization codepaths, mitigating against bugs that arise out of test/non-test initialization inconsistencies\r\n\r\n### De-globalizing `g_chainman`\r\n\r\nExcerpt from #20049\r\n> In order to modularize our consensus engine, we need to first de-globalize the global `ChainstateManager` -- namely `g_chainman` -- as it and its dependencies are what makes up the bulk of our consensus engine. A few direct references to `g_chainman` have already been removed in #19927, however, its indirect uses (mainly via `::Chain(state|)Active()`) are numerous in our codebase and often used to ~~cheat~~ avoid obtaining a `ChainstateManager` reference.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis changeset moves the global `ChainstateManger` to `NodeContext` and removes `::Chain{state,}Active()` as a first step towards better modularization of our consensus engine. \r\n\r\nThe commits are ordered as such:\r\n1. Fixes to our existing codebase crucial to subsequent changes in this changeset\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...dongcarl:2020-10-chainman-fixes\r\n1. Remove all references to `g_chainman`, `::Chain{state,}Active()`\r\n\t1. In `src/validation.{cpp,h}`\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions related to `::LookupBlockIndex` in the call graph\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/2020-10-chainman-fixes...dongcarl:2020-09-libbitcoinruntime-v4\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions that are mempool-related\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/dongcarl:2020-09-libbitcoinruntime-v4...2020-09-reduce-validation-mempool-ccsactiveglobal-usage\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions which do not belong in previous bundles\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/2020-09-reduce-validation-mempool-ccsactiveglobal-usage...dongcarl:2020-09-reduce-validation-ccsactiveglobal-usage\r\n\t1.

In `src/rest.cpp`\r\n\t1. In auxiliary modules of the codebase\r\n\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/dongcarl:2020-10-libbitcoinruntime-v7...2020-10-libbitcoinruntime-v8\r\n\t\t1. In `src/bench`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/index`\r\n\t1.

In `src/test`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/wallet/test`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/qt/test`\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n- The above ordering is constructed according to the overall call graph of our codebase such that we avoid touching the same function/module twice. \r\n- Due to the length of this overall change, each commit aims to be trivially-reviewable and only requires the reviewer to reason about the correctness of one function/module at a time.\r\n- There are a lot of review-only assertions which can be used to check for correctness. They are removed in 2236237070a45fe570cd0113f0025b0a46ac89be.\r\n",

This bundle may _apparently_ introduce usage of `g_chainman` or `::Chain(state|)Active()` globals, but these are resolved later on in the overall PR. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n2. There may be seemingly obvious local references to `ChainstateManager` or other validation objects which are not being used in callers of the current function in question, this is done intentionally to **_keep each commit centered around one function/method_** to ease review and to make the overall change systematic. We don't assume anything about our callers. Rest assured that once we are considering that particular caller in later commits, we will use the obvious local references. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n3. When changing a function/method that has many callers (e.g. `LookupBlockIndex` with 55 callers), it is sometimes easier (and less error-prone) to use a scripted-diff. When doing so, there will be 3 commits in sequence so that every commit compiles like so:\r\n\t1. Add `new_function`, make `old_function` a wrapper of `new_function`, divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the local module only**\r\n\t2. Scripted-diff to divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the rest of the codebase**\r\n\t3. Remove `old_function`\r\n\r\nNote to self:\r\n- [x] Address: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20750#discussion_r579400663",

There are a few moveonyish/refactoring commits to allow for halfway decent unittests.\r\n\r\nBasic structure is included for specifying and checking the assumeutxo hash values used to validate activated snapshots. Initially I had specified a few height/hash pairs for mainnet in this change, but because of the security-critical nature of those parameters, I figured it was better to leave their inclusion to a future PR that includes only that change - my intent being that reviewers will be more likely to verify those parameters firsthand in a dedicated PR.\r\n\r\nAside from that and the snapshot activation logic, there are a few related changes:\r\n\r\n- ~~allow caching the `nChainTx` value in the CCoinsViewDB; this is set during snapshot activation. Because we don't necessarily have access to the full chain at the time of snapshot load, this value is communicated through the snapshot metadata and must be cached within the chainstate to survive restarts.~~\r\n- break out `CreateUTXOSnapshot()` from dumptxoutset. This is essentially a move-only change to allow the reuse of snapshot creation logic from within unittests.\r\n- ...and a few other misc. changes that are solely related to unittests.\r\n\r\nThe move-onlyish commit is most easily reviewed with `--color-moved=zebra`.",

The only reason we don't do that is to support `-segwitheight=-1`.\r\n- that in turn allows us to drop all of the `GetLocalServices() & NODE_WITNESS` checks inside `net_processing.cpp`, since our local services would always include `NODE_WITNESS`",

This bundle may _apparently_ introduce usage of `g_chainman` or `::Chain(state|)Active()` globals, but these are resolved later on in the overall PR. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n2. There may be seemingly obvious local references to `ChainstateManager` or other validation objects which are not being used in callers of the current function in question, this is done intentionally to **_keep each commit centered around one function/method_** to ease review and to make the overall change systematic. We don't assume anything about our callers. Rest assured that once we are considering that particular caller in later commits, we will use the obvious local references. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n3. When changing a function/method that has many callers (e.g. `LookupBlockIndex` with 55 callers), it is sometimes easier (and less error-prone) to use a scripted-diff. When doing so, there will be 3 commits in sequence so that every commit compiles like so:\r\n\t1. Add `new_function`, make `old_function` a wrapper of `new_function`, divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the local module only**\r\n\t2. Scripted-diff to divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the rest of the codebase**\r\n\t3. Remove `old_function`",

This bundle may _apparently_ introduce usage of `g_chainman` or `::Chain(state|)Active()` globals, but these are resolved later on in the overall PR. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n2. There may be seemingly obvious local references to `ChainstateManager` or other validation objects which are not being used in callers of the current function in question, this is done intentionally to **_keep each commit centered around one function/method_** to ease review and to make the overall change systematic. We don't assume anything about our callers. Rest assured that once we are considering that particular caller in later commits, we will use the obvious local references. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n3. When changing a function/method that has many callers (e.g. `LookupBlockIndex` with 55 callers), it is sometimes easier (and less error-prone) to use a scripted-diff. When doing so, there will be 3 commits in sequence so that every commit compiles like so:\r\n\t1. Add `new_function`, make `old_function` a wrapper of `new_function`, divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the local module only**\r\n\t2. Scripted-diff to divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the rest of the codebase**\r\n\t3. Remove `old_function`",

Includes a new unittest verifying `g_best_block` behavior (previously untested at the unit level) and various changes necessary for running and testing `ProcessNewBlock()`-like behavior on the background validation chainstate.\r\n\r\nThis changeset introduces a new block index `nStatus` flag called `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID`, and it is applied to block index entries that are beneath the UTXO snapshot base block upon snapshot load. Once each block is validated (during async background validation), the flag is removed. This allows us to avoid (ab)using `BLOCK_VALID_*` flags for snapshot chain block entries, and preserves the original meaning of those flags.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR previously incorporated changes to `LoadBlockIndex()` and `RewindBlockIndex()` as noted in Russ' comments below, but once I generated the changes necessary to test the UpdateTip change, I decided to split this changes out into another PR due to the size of this one.",

Based on the assertions here, `-reindex` will not bring them to tip, so what's the point of telling the user to reindex at all? Or is this behavior specific to the functional tests, and in practice `-reindex` *would* bring the upgraded node to tip? (I'll need to review the reindex code; I can't remember what to expect there.)\r\n\r\nIf we expect users to remove their blocksdir before restarting with `-reindex`, you might consider mentioning that in the error message you've included in `init.cpp`.",

      "body": "Ah, I should have updated the PR description. Updated to now say:\r\n\r\n> This PR introduces NeedsRedownload() which merely checks for insufficiently validated segwit blocks and requests that the user restarts the node with `-reindex`. Reindexing the block files upon restart will make the node rebuild chain state and block index from the `blk*.dat` files on disk. The node won't be able to index the blocks with `BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS`, so they will be missing from the chain and be re-downloaded, with witness data.\r\n\r\nSorry for the confusion. \r\n\r\nAs for the `-reindex` code, the call path is: `src/init.cpp::Threadimport()` -> `validation.cpp:CChainState::LoadExternalBlockFile()` -> `validation.cpp:CChainState::AcceptBlock()` -> `validation.cpp:ContextualCheckBlock()`. The last function tries to [validate for witness commitments](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4b5659c6b115315c9fd2902b4edd4b960a5e066e/src/validation.cpp#L3418) and is [unable to](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4b5659c6b115315c9fd2902b4edd4b960a5e066e/src/validation.cpp#L3436) thereby causing the block to not be accepted into the chain upon a restart with `-reindex`\r\n\r\nUsing `combine_logs.py` for `test/functional/p2p_segwit.py` you can see lines like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n node2 2021-04-22T14:56:56.543661Z [loadblk] [util/system.h:52] [error] ERROR: AcceptBlock: bad-witness-nonce-size, ContextualCheckBlock : invalid witness reserved value size\r\n node2 2021-04-22T14:56:56.544812Z [loadblk] [util/system.h:52] [error] ERROR: AcceptBlock: bad-witness-nonce-size, ContextualCheckBlock : invalid witness reserved value size\r\n```",
