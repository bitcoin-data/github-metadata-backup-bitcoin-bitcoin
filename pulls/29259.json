    "body": "I find myself making pull requests against my fork (mostly on top of #28983), or asking others to do so. Since I don't want to splurge on a Cirrus account, and since Github free minutes are limited, I looked into how self hosted runners work on Github.\r\n\r\nYou can see this PR in action on this pull request to my fork: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/actions/runs/7554260507\r\n\r\nTo test it yourself, spin up one or more [self hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners) (each as its own user), install Docker (maybe in [single user mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)), and then make a pull request to your own fork, with this PR as the base branch.\r\n\r\nSecurity wise: when dealing with code from strangers on the internet, review it first before running the CI.\r\n\r\nThis PR also disables Github Actions on forks in order to prevent forks from running out of free minutes (that their owners may need for other projects with much shorter CI runs). This could be made into a separate PR, or dropped altogether.\r\n\r\nThe first two commits could be split out as well.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] deduplicate yaml (can't use anchors https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/1182)\r\n- [ ] add macOS native worker\r\n- [ ] add Windows native worker (I can't easily test this myself, so might leave it followup)\r\n- [ ] prevent self hosted jobs from cluttering UI on the main \r\n- [ ] check behaviour against the gui repo\r\n- [ ] make resource consumption configurable (some function of nproc? or configured locally on the workers?)\r\n- [ ] documentation\r\n\r\nRelated: I wrote a [gist](https://gist.github.com/Sjors/cd55370fa67aa095df90c433ee9bd135) for how to run CI on Ubuntu desktop with one runner per window. The windows close if the run is successful so you can inspect the ones that fail. But I find using Github's CI web interface a bit more convenient, hence this PR.",

GitHub \"free\" minutes should also be unlimited for public open source, no?\r\n\r\n> Related: I wrote a [gist](https://gist.github.com/Sjors/cd55370fa67aa095df90c433ee9bd135) for how to run CI on Ubuntu desktop with one runner per window.\r\n\r\nNice, but generally I don't think there is a need to run *all* CI tasks locally, because it is faster and easier to just use your normal workflow to compile and run the Bitcoin Core tests. Using the normal workflow has the benefit that modifications are faster picked up, without having to start the CI task from scratch.\r\n\r\nGenerally, I expect the workflow to be something like:\r\n\r\n* Write code, format code.\r\n* Compile and run tests (manual, unit, functional, fuzz, ...), depending on what was changed.\r\n* Make a pull request and wait for the CI result. (`lint` should be running and be complete within a minute or two)\r\n* In case there is a CI failure, the fix is either trivial and obvious, in which case a quick force push can be done\r\n* If not, the CI failure should be reproduced locally by using sanitizers (valigrind, asan, ...) or libFuzzer, or whatever config flag is used in the CI task that caused the failure.\r\n* Only if the failure can not be reproduced in the normal workflow, the CI task can be debugged via the CI runner. (Depending on how many pushes are needed, people are free to use the public runners in this repo, I'd say)",

      "body": "> A Cirrus account is free for public open source projects, as well as persistent workers connected to it. \r\n\r\n> The workers currently use Cirrus self-hosted ones, so no changes are needed. This is documented in the cirrus yaml\r\n\r\nThis is a bit confusing. It's free but we use self hosting instead? Is that for performance, security some configuration issue?\r\n\r\nI just gave Cirrus permission to run on my fork, but it complains \"No public persistent worker pools found!\" for all jobs. So I guess self-hosting is not optional for forks?\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can figure out how to get this to work. It seems the first step is to add a (private?) worker in https://cirrus-ci.com/settings/github/Sjors and then install cirrus-cli in a way similar to how it works for Github?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-cli/blob/master/PERSISTENT-WORKERS.md\r\n\r\nIn the long run a (slight) dependency on Cirrus for CI may be better than Github, since the deeper we integrate with Github, the more difficult it is to move code hosting / coordination elsewhere.

          "body": "I find myself making pull requests against my fork (mostly on top of #28983), or asking others to do so. Currently only the Github actions are run on forks, because we use self-hosted runners for the Cirrus tasks.\r\n\r\nWhile setting up my own self-hosted runners for my fork, I ran into a number of issues. This PR addresses those.\r\n\r\nSome issues are related to me using multiple regular users on the same physical machine, rather than running every worker in a VM.\r\n\r\nReplaces #29259 using the self hosted workers via Cirrus instead of Github.\r\n\r\nYou can see this PR in action on this pull request to my fork: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/30\r\n\r\nTo test it yourself:\r\n1. spin up at least two [self hosted runners](https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-cli/blob/master/PERSISTENT-WORKERS.md). Either use a seperate VM for each, or give them their own user.\r\n2. Install Docker (maybe in [single user mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)) and `podman-docker` (see `.cirrus.yml`)\r\n3. Give Cirrus access to your fork at `https://cirrus-ci.com/settings/github/YOU`\r\n4. Get a token from Cirrus and use it to start your worker(s)\r\n5. Optionally set `NO_ARM=true` and `NO_NOBLE=true` env variables (see `.cirrus.yml`)\r\n6. make a pull request to your own fork, with this PR as the base branch\r\n\r\nSecurity wise: when dealing with code from strangers on the internet, review it first before running the CI. There's a Cirrus check-box that requires approval for people without write access to trigger CI.",
