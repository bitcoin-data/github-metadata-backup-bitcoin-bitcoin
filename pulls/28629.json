    "body": "This is one way to fix #28600\r\n\r\nRecently usage of undeclared functions became an error rather than a warning, in C2x. https://reviews.llvm.org/D122983?id=420290\r\n\r\nThis change has migrated into the build tools of Ubuntu 23.10 which now causes the USDT tests to fail to compile, see\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28600\r\n\r\nI think there are various potential fixes:\r\n\r\n1. Manually declare the functions we use\r\n2. Fix imports so that manual declarations aren't needed\r\n3. Revert the new C2X behaviour and don't error on implicit function declarations\r\n\r\nI would have preferred solution 2, but I believe this will require changes to the upstream bcc package. Having played with the imports I can get things working in a standalone C program, using system headers, but when building the program from a python context as we do in the test it uses its own headers (bundled with the python lib) rather than the system ones, and manually importing (some) system headers results in definition mismatches. I also investigated explicitly importing required headers from the package, which use paths like `#import </virtual/bcc/bcc_helpers.h>`, but this seems more obtuse and brittle than simply ignoring the warning.\r\n \r\nTherefore I think that until the upstream python pacakge fixes their declarations, we should fix this by setting `-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration` for the tracing programs.\r\n\r\ncc maflcko 0xB10C ",

Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, score_before=0, score_increase=20, message='getdata message size = 50001', threshold_exceeded=false\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",
