Most of them would be terrible due to huge excess and hence waste, so another solution would be chosen. But in some cases excess higher than upper bound would be\r\neconomically optimal based on waste metric.\r\n\r\nThis change also makes transaction building and waste calculation consistent. Specifically it eliminates two sources of discrepancy: \r\n\r\n1. for knapsack we used to always calculate waste as if they produce change (that's not always true)\r\n2. change could be dropped to fees during tx building after waste is calculated \r\n\r\nAs a result we should see more changeless solutions which is good for: privacy, utxo set, total fees paid.

It did find 10% more changeless solutions and an overall decrease in fee expenditure, but there were a few outcomes where the final input set that was used to fund transactions caused change output to be created that just exceeded the dust limit. \r\n\r\nEdit: I see that you appear to always drop everything below `min_change` to fees, so we'd have to see how that changes the overall fee, and whether we might still need a limit for the overshoot of BnB inputs. Or perhaps whether we have to weight the excess differently than other types of costs that are less avoidable.",

I just moved it higher and passed the threshold to coin selection so waste calculation is based on the same tx structure as transaction building. What's new is that in case of BnB we will never created change now. \r\n\r\nWe already limit max absolute fee by `DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_MAXFEE = COIN / 10`. Maybe we can just lower the default?\r\n\r\nI tend to think that whenever we have a solution with huge excess from BnB, we should get the same solution but with change instead of excess found by other selection algorithms. The problem is that SRD has min change of COIN/100/2, and knapsack is not deterministic AFAIK. Maybe need to try to prove this more formally? Or consider adding another algo in the mix that will deterministically produce a solution with change\r\n",

We don't need `GetChange` to be exact down to the satoshi. Rather it just needs to be close enough to the real change (and essentially be whether there is going to be a change output) and its exact value can be adjusted later in `CreateTransaction` once we know the real size of the transaction. That adjustment doesn't need to account for dust because that should be taken care of here.\r\n\r\nIt also seems like it is not necessary to calculate the change on the fly like this. Rather the coin selection algorithms should already know what the change is based on their parameters when they selected. While we don't know the fees exactly due to rolling them into the target, we do know how much was selected and what the input fees should be, so we can calculate the change in the `SelectCoins*` functions and just set it in `SelectionResult`.",
