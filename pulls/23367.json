Most of them would be terrible due to huge excess and hence waste, so another solution would be chosen. But in some cases excess higher than upper bound would be\r\neconomically optimal based on waste metric.\r\n\r\nThis change also makes transaction building and waste calculation consistent. Specifically it eliminates two sources of discrepancy: \r\n\r\n1. for knapsack we used to always calculate waste as if they produce change (that's not always true)\r\n2. change could be dropped to fees during tx building after waste is calculated \r\n\r\nAs a result we should see more changeless solutions which is good for: privacy, utxo set, total fees paid.

This does not work for bumping in the GUI nor `bumpfee` because these need private keys available to sign and send the transaction. But `psbtbumpfee` returns a psbt, so it is fine to not be able to sign.\r\n\r\nIn order to correctly estimate the size of the inputs for coin selection, the fee bumper will use the size of the inputs of the transaction being bumped. Because the sizes of signatures are not guaranteed, for external inputs, the fee bumper will verify the scripts with a special SignatureChecker which will compute the weight of all of the signatures in that input, and compute their weights if those signatures were maximally sized. This allows the fee bumper to obtain a max size estimate for each external input.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #23201 as it relies on the ability to pass weights in to coin selection.\r\n\r\nCloses #23189",

It did find 10% more changeless solutions and an overall decrease in fee expenditure, but there were a few outcomes where the final input set that was used to fund transactions caused change output to be created that just exceeded the dust limit. \r\n\r\nEdit: I see that you appear to always drop everything below `min_change` to fees, so we'd have to see how that changes the overall fee, and whether we might still need a limit for the overshoot of BnB inputs. Or perhaps whether we have to weight the excess differently than other types of costs that are less avoidable.",

      "body": "> Edit: I see that you appear to always drop everything below `min_change` to fees, so we'd have to see how that changes the overall fee, and whether we might still need a limit for the overshoot of BnB inputs. \r\n\r\nJust to clarify, dropping to fees behaviour is not changed. I just moved it higher and passed the threshold to coin selection so waste calculation is based on the same tx structure as transaction building. What's new is that in case of BnB we will never created change now. \r\n\r\nWe already limit max absolute fee by `DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_MAXFEE = COIN / 10`. Maybe we can just lower the default?\r\n\r\nI tend to think that whenever we have a solution with huge excess from BnB, we should get the same solution but with change instead of excess found by other selection algorithms. The problem is that SRD has min change of COIN/100/2, and knapsack is not deterministic AFAIK. Maybe need to try to prove this more formally? Or consider adding another algo in the mix that will deterministically produce a solution with change\r\n",

Also, the fee calculation data (`FeeCalculation& fee_calc_out`) would be another candidate to put into the structure, but `FeeCalculation` is currently an opaque data type in the wallet interface and I think it should stay that way.\r\n\r\nAs a potential follow-up, I think it would make sense to also do the same refactoring for `CWallet::FundTransaction`, which has a very similar parameter structure.\r\n\r\nSuggested by laanwj in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20588#issuecomment-739838428.",

          "body": "There are no code changes, this is just adding `namespace` and `using` declarations and `node::` or `wallet::` qualifiers in some places.\r\n\r\nMotivations for this change are:\r\n\r\n- To make it easier to see when node and wallet code is being accessed places where it shouldn't be. For example if GUI code is accessing node and wallet internals or if wallet and node code are referencing each other.\r\n- To make source code organization clearer ([#15732](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15732)), being able to know that `wallet::` code is in `src/wallet/`, `node::` code is in `src/node/`, `init::` code is in `src/init/`, `util::` code is in `src/util/`, etc.\r\n\r\nReviewing with `git log -p -n1 -U0 --word-diff-regex=.` can be helpful to verify this is only updating declarations, not changing code.",

As such, it is reasonable to allow negative effective value UTXOs as inputs as otherwise the target value (the balance) cannot be reached. However this is not always desirable as there may be solutions with only positive EV UTXOs, so we only try with negative EV UTXOs if we are unable to find any solutions with the normal groupings.\r\n\r\nFixes #23026",

In the current master branch, this would require a cast to `uint32_t` because `CFeeRate` has the following constructor:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/29074ba8364d4c0bf70121210222aff3fbf1e4df/src/policy/feerate.cpp#L12\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to remove the need for the casting. \r\n\r\nThe PR's commit is cherry-picked from sipa's https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/202111_mempoolfr branch (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21422#issuecomment-978235017) which improves #21422.\r\n\r\nThe PR is currently a draft as I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\npolicy/feerate.cpp: In constructor ‘CFeeRate::CFeeRate(const CAmount&, uint64_t)’:\r\npolicy/feerate.cpp:14:25: warning: narrowing conversion of ‘num_bytes’ from ‘uint64_t’ {aka ‘long unsigned int’} to ‘int64_t’ {aka ‘long int’} [-Wnarrowing]\r\n   14 |     const int64_t nSize{num_bytes};\r\n      |                         ^~~~~~~~~\r\npolicy/feerate.cpp: In member function ‘CAmount CFeeRate::GetFee(uint64_t) const’:\r\npolicy/feerate.cpp:25:25: warning: narrowing conversion of ‘num_bytes’ from ‘uint64_t’ {aka ‘long unsigned int’} to ‘int64_t’ {aka ‘long int’} [-Wnarrowing]\r\n   25 |     const int64_t nSize{num_bytes};\r\n```\r\n\r\nduring compilation. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I would like to get some early feedback if the PR makes sense to you or not.",

Furthermore static_cast<T>(...) allows for easier grepping of casts.\r\n\r\nFor a more thorough discussion, see \"ES.49: If you must use a cast, use a named cast\"\r\nin the C++ Core Guidelines (Stroustrup & Sutter).\r\n```\r\n\r\nModern tooling, specifically `-Wold-style-cast` can enable us to enforce never using C-style casts. I believe this is especially important due to the number of C-style casts the codebase is currently being used as a reinterpret_cast. reinterpret_casts are especially dangerous, and should never be done via C-style casts.\r\n\r\nUpdate the docs to suggest the use of named cast or functional casts.",

We don't need `GetChange` to be exact down to the satoshi. Rather it just needs to be close enough to the real change (and essentially be whether there is going to be a change output) and its exact value can be adjusted later in `CreateTransaction` once we know the real size of the transaction. That adjustment doesn't need to account for dust because that should be taken care of here.\r\n\r\nIt also seems like it is not necessary to calculate the change on the fly like this. Rather the coin selection algorithms should already know what the change is based on their parameters when they selected. While we don't know the fees exactly due to rolling them into the target, we do know how much was selected and what the input fees should be, so we can calculate the change in the `SelectCoins*` functions and just set it in `SelectionResult`.",
