    "body": "A memory leak has been fixed. After an http connection is open it is never closed. The loop method has been modified to close the connection upon completion.\n\nThere have been several other changes, all of which are in accordance with standard practice in the Python community:\n- spaces instead of tabs\n- improved whitespace\n- correctly ordered import statements.\n- `print` functions instead of statements.\n- string `format` method instead of deprecated `%` syntax\n- `setdefault` method for setting dictionary defaults\n- among many other minor changes.\n\nNotes:\n- These changes have made it easier to understand and modify the codebase.\n- This code did not have tests; incorporating tests would require a more significant refactor. Due to the nature of my intended changes, I decided it was not necessary at this point to refactor to that extent.\n- This code did not have docstrings (See PEP 257: http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). In order to successfully refactor and test this in the future docstrings will prove helpful.\n",

      "body": "Looks mostly OK.  I readily admit my python, like my JavaScript and C++, looks like it was written by a C coder.\n\n\"Whoever created this file used tabs instead of spaces, which is very inconvenient to anyone that needs to edit this.\" is always met with a snort, because the reverse is true.  Tabs enables custom indentation, spaces do not.  Furthermore, after much reading of various python code from various authors, it is apparent that the Linus maxim continues to be true:  8-space-sized tabs lead to more readable code, because it forces the programmer to break up their code into small, readable units that just do one thing.\n\nPEP8 is no defense against the widespread \"death before helper function\" practice, in the python-writing bitcoin community at least, where 200 line, 200 column methods are the norm.\n\nBut it is not your fault that the python community are anti-productive blockheads in this regard, so the likely course is to accept PEP8 with all its idiocy (and these changes).\n",
