The builders that passed seem to have used some kind of cached config and didn't actually pick up -ftrapv. The one that's failing is failing because there's a shell quoting issue with how configure is invoked.\r\n\r\nGCC 4.8 also supports -fsanitize=address and -fsanitize=thread (and newer GCC versions have a whole plethora or really interesting options).
