Only the two commits \"Dedup nTimeFirstKey update logic\" and \"Use importmulti timestamp when importing watch only keys\" pertain to this PR. The other three commits belong to #9682).\r\n\r\nThis fixes issue #9034.\r\n\r\nWhen importing a watch-only address over importmulti with a specific timestamp,\r\nthe wallet's nTimeFirstKey is currently set to 1. After this change, the\r\nprovided timestamp will be used and stored as metadata associated with\r\nwatch-only key. This can improve wallet performance because it can avoid the\r\nneed to scan the entire blockchain for watch only addresses when timestamps are\r\nprovided.",
