    "body": "TLDR: Mention that the codebase is now compatible with C++17, and that the\r\nintention is to require C++17 starting with 0.22.0.\r\n\r\nFollowing some discussion with Cory/Carl, and in #16684, I think this is the next step in the C++17 migration.\r\n\r\nWhile #16684 mentions a gitian/Guix release with C++17, it's not yet clear how that would be done. Are we just going to pass `--enable-c++17` in gitian/Guix?. Are we changing our default in configure.ac? \r\n\r\nAccording to the [last comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16684#issuecomment-643778757) in #16684, we wouldn't be changing anything in depends:\r\n> No, everything (including depends) will stay at C++11. \r\n\r\nHowever I don't think we want to be mixing C++11 built dependencies, with a C++17 built bitcoind, if there is any potential for compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nInstead, I'd suggest we build the 0.21.0 release as C++11, and do a complete switch to C++17 for 0.22.0. Also, if we actually wanted to use C++17 in depends for 0.21.0, we couldn't without breaking C++11 compat (Qt). See below.\r\n\r\nHere is a potential timeline/TODOs for the migration:\r\n\r\nPotential Timeline\r\n* 17 / 6 / 2020 - Today\r\n* Some time prior to split-off:\r\n    * Confirm that compiling with C++17 works.\r\n    * Confirm that C++11 compatibility has not been broken.\r\n* 1 / 11 / 2020\r\n    * [0.21.0 split off happens](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18947).\r\n* 2 / 11 / 2020\r\n    * Merge an \"incompatible with C++11\" change into master.\r\n    * Switch configure to use C++17 mode by default.\r\n    * Update minimum compiler requirements. At least:\r\n        * Clang 5: https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx17\r\n        * GCC 7: https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17\r\n            * While GCC has some support from 5, it seems a more complete support landed in GCC 7. \r\n            * https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-7/changes.html#cxx\r\n    * Switch depends packages to use C++17 where applicable.\r\n    * Bump Qt from 5.9.x (no c++17 mode) to, likely, 5.15.x (LTS).\r\n    * Drop support for macOS < 10.14.x\r\n        * The c++ dylib shipped with macOS [doesn't support c++17, prior to macOS 10.14](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16684#issuecomment-643722538).\r\n        * Building Qt 5.12 or 5.15 in C++17 mode will also require a minimum macOS deployment target of 10.14. https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/283832.\r\n    * Begin merging PRs like #19183 and #19245.\r\n        * I've left some comments in #19183 if the macOS runtime issue interests anyone.\r\n* 3 / 12 / 2020\r\n    * 0.21.0 released.\r\n    * Built as C++11.\r\n    * Contains warning in release notes that compiling 0.22.0 will require C++17.\r\n* 3 / 6 / 2021\r\n    * 0.22.0 released.\r\n    * Full of C++17 code.\r\n\r\nOne thing worth noting, is that we cannot bump our Qt to a newer LTS for 0.21.0, without breaking C++11 compatibility. Qt 5.12 is not compilable in C++11 mode, as the project has started using C++14 features throughout at least the macOS portions of it's codebase, and seemingly \"forgotten\" that the release is meant to be C++11 compatible. \r\nUpstream bug here: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-77310.\r\n> Building Qt requires C+11, at a minimum, but in practice we use later features, usually under a feature define, or with a fallback of some kind. On platforms that support > C11, we've (apparently) not considered the fallback necessary, under the assumption C+14 is always available.",

In other words, happy to wait for 0.22. Regardless, I look forward to the 0.21.0 branch-off.\r\n\r\n> Bump Qt from 5.9.x (no c++17 mode) to, likely, 5.15.x (LTS)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately QT retroactively dropped LTS for 5.15 (see #18580), i.e. it's commercial support only. But as @MarcoFalke pointed out:\r\n\r\n> I don't think we have a choice. Now that they dropped LTS, all we can do is follow their latest open source release\r\n\r\nIt's certainly doesn't seem like a reason to stick to a c++11 version of QT, since those aren't maintained at all, making it mostly an orthogonal concern.",
