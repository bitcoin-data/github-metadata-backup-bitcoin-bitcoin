If you want to be 100% certain to not step on an existing one, could you open a (real) file descriptor, connected to something like a `pipe()` or `/dev/null` etc, and use that? Or do you use the fact that it needs to be a non-allocated file descriptor somewhere?\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about going with `INVALID_SOCKET - 1` is that it doesn't involve slowdowns due to syscalls, and that reading or writing from fd `INVALID_SOCKET - 1` is guaranteed to fail (unless the fuzzing harness has four billion open file descriptors :)).\r\n\r\nNote that `INVALID_SOCKET - 1` is 4 294 967 294, and that POSIX requires file descriptor id re-use on `close`.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR is only a short-term bug fix to avoid file descriptors stdin (0), stdout (1), stderr (2) and other likely to be used file descriptors while awaiting [vasild's suggested cleanup/refactoring](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21630#discussion_r611413951).",
