    "body": "This README was a little sparse in my opinion, and was missing a mention of the `diff-addrs` command.\r\n\r\nThe README updates add background and examples for each command, split in two sections (encode/decode and diff/diff-addrs). This is intended to help people know how and when to run the commands available in the `asmap-tool.py` script.\r\n\r\nHowever, I could use some confirmation on the behavior of the `--fill` flag. It's true that files generated with this flag set cannot be used to diff files after the fact, but i don't quite follow what the fill flag does to make that true. sipa could you maybe provide some insight?",

      "body": "@jurraca\r\n\r\nThe asmap binary format effectively just encodes a mapping from ip ranges to AS numbers by encoding them as a sequence of match instructions, conditional jumps, and return values.\r\n\r\nA whole lot of ranges are unmapped, however, i.e., there just is no AS number for them. What the `--fill` option does is allow the encoder to map these unmapped ranges to anything, picking whatever is most efficient to encode. For example, if `123.45.0.0/24` and `123.45.2.0/23` map to AS12345, but `123.45.1.0/24` is unmapped, it may turn the whole thing into `123.45.0.0/22 AS12345`, because it can be done by just looking at the top 22 bits, rather than the top 23 or 24 bits.\r\n\r\nDoing this results in a non-trivial reduction of the size of the asmap file, as there are often multiple mappings to the same AS number in a small range, with some unmapped holes in between.\r\n\r\nHowever, it also has a downside for comparability. Because the fillings are chosen in function on whatever just makes the encoding simplest, small changes in the (actual) mapped ranges may translate occasionally to big changes in what the unmapped ranges get assigned. So looking at the diff between two filled asmap files, without ignoring the unmapped ranges in them, will give a distorted view.",

Right now, because the `--ignore-unassigned` part is right above it, I thought the block would demonstrate something about this flag but the block includes such entries and I think it doesn't require an additional example.
