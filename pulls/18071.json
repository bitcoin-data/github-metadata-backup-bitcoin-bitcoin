    "body": "These are a couple common refactoring changes in both Taproot and CTV that I think can be merged as is. Other than that the two PRs should largely be conflict free (except for caching, which is a relatively trivial fix).\r\n\r\nThese essentially just allow us to get access to the single SHA256 version of Get{Prevouts,Sequence,Outputs} hash which are used both in the Taproot and CTV spec. They use the single hash versions because they are cheaper to compute, which reduces validation overhead. These refactors are non-functional, and just expose the ability to get the single hash when needed.\r\n\r\nThe names of Get\\*Hash are renamed to Get\\*SHA256 to avoid confusion with the value returned previously.",

If `CheckBlock()` or `AcceptBlock()` fails, then PNB returns to net processing without calling the (asynchronous) `BlockChecked` Validation Interface method. net processing can use the invalid `BlockValidationState` returned to punish peers.\r\n\r\n`CheckBlock()` and `AcceptBlock()` represent the DoS checks on a block (ie PoW and malleability). Net processing wants to know about those failed checks immediately and shouldn't have to wait on a callback. Other validation interface clients don't care about net processing submitting bogus malleated blocks to validation, so they don't need to be notified of `BlockChecked`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if PNB returns a valid `BlockValidationState`, we never need to try to process (non-malleated) copies of the block from other peers. That makes it much easier to move the best chain activation logic to a background thread in future work.",

Instead they're initialized inside the `CheckInputScripts()` function. This allows a later commit to add the spent UTXOs to that structure. The spent UTXOs are required for the schnorr signature hash, since it commits to the scriptPubKeys. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#common-signature-message for details.\r\n\r\nBy itself, this isn't really an improvement to the code, but I think it makes sense to separate out the refactor/moveonly commits from PR #17977 so that PR is only the logical changes needed for Schnorr/Taproot.",

          "body": "This builds off #18468 since it simplifies this PR a bunch. Review that first.\r\n\r\nWe can avoid many unnecessary `std::vector` allocations by changing\r\n`CBloomFilter` to take `Span`s instead of `std::vector`s for the `insert`\r\nand `contains` operations.\r\n\r\n`CBloomFilter` currently converts types such as `CDataStream` and `uint256`\r\nto `std::vector` on `insert` and `contains`. This is unnecessary because\r\n`CDataStream`s and `uint256`s are already `std::vectors` internally. We just\r\nneed a way to point to the right data within those types. `Span` gives\r\nus this ability.\r\n\r\nThis is a part of the Zero Allocations Project #18849 (ZAP3). This code came up as a place where many allocations occur. Mainly due to allocations of `CService::GetKey` which is passed to these functions, but this PR is needed before we get to that.\r\n",

It should be harder to misuse this API as the types are more clear in the places we use it.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if there is consensus preferring the approach currently in #17977, we'd want to minimally see changes to the Taproot version to both:\r\n\r\n1) change the parameter names for consistency.\r\n2) make the SHA256Uint256 take a `const uint256&` instead of a `uint256&`.\r\n\r\nI think those are all the differences, aside from the precomputed caches (which would be inappropriate to modify in this PR)?

      "body": "> It's still unresolved if the `CheapHash` function can use `GetHash` (instead of `GetSHA256`) without breaking Addrman's bucketing. See [#19055 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19055#discussion_r460172516)\r\n\r\nI think that consideration can be left for a follow-up. It is a further behavior change that makes sense to review separately to make sure nothing breaks. And this change here is valuable enough without it for #17977 etc. So after it is merged the other PRs can be rebased and the `CheapHash` discussion can go on without blocking anything.",

      "body": "I agree with @fjahr, it's best if this PR can make no functional changes. Am happy to make a follow-up PR that can be reviewed independently switching cheaphash to a single sha256 (or as sipa points out, even siphash). @Sjors is that OK?\r\n\r\n@jnewbery this PR has been open for half a year, and is a part of my review of the Taproot code. The below should be about the only diff required as a result of interface changes, which mostly have to be patched into 41d08f5d77f52bec0e31bb081d85fff2d67d0467. This code is more clear because m_*_hash is not touched once it has been set.\r\n\r\nRegardless of this PR, the function signatures should be changed to a const ref. It's not clear to me that it's defined behavior to pass an r-value as a non-const ref, which is done in the taproot code currently (hence the interface changes here -- clearly no UB). If there is consensus that the interfaces should not change, preferring the approach in #17977, I can refactor this PR to be similar.\r\n\r\nedit: I guess it's not using UB...
