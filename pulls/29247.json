    "body": "# CAT in Tapscript\r\n\r\nThis PR provides the necessary code to enable the opcode OP\\_CAT in Tapscript as specified in [BIP-347: OP\\_CAT in Tapscript](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki) and [BIN-2024-0001](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/binana/blob/master/2024/BIN-2024-0001.md),\r\n\r\n**Important:** This PR *does not* include miner activation functionality. This means that merging this PR into bitcoin-core will not make OP\\_CAT functional in Bitcoin.\r\nIf this PR is merged it is *not* a signal of community consensus around activating CAT nor be read as a portent about the activation process or timeline.\r\nThe PR is not a stand-in for consensus around such decisions.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n\r\n- An implementation of the Tapscript opcode OP\\_CAT along with the flags `SCRIPT_VERIFY_OP_CAT` and `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT`.\r\n- Integration and unit tests which ensure that our CAT  implementation works as expected. This includes ensuring that CAT never uses more that 520 bytes of stack memory. A full description of what these tests cover is given below.\r\n- An improvement to `src/test/script_tests.cpp` JSON script format enabling the rapid creation of new Tapscript unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Activation on Bitcoin-inquisition (signet)\r\n\r\n[Bitcoin-inquisition PR 37](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/39) which contained our implementation of OP\\_CAT [was merged into bitcoin-inquisition (signet) on Apr 25 2024](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/39), released as [bitcoin-inquisition release 25.2 on Apr 26 2024.](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/releases/tag/v25.2-inq) and activated in bitcoin-inquisition Apr 30 2024. The bitcoin-inquisition PR was reviewed in the PR review club [(transcript of discussion)](https://bitcoincore.reviews/bitcoin-inquisition-39). Since Apr 30 2024 there have been many OP\\_CAT transactions created and spent on signet.\r\n\r\nThe code merged into bitcoin-inquisition differs from this PR, as we have removed the consensus logic which was used to activate it on signet.\r\n\r\n## OP\\_CAT Tapscript Implementation\r\n\r\nWe implement OP\\_CAT as a new Tapscript op code by redefining the opcode OP\\_SUCCESS126 (126 in decimal and 0x7e in hexadecimal). This is the same opcode value used by the original OP_CAT.\r\n\r\nWhen evaluated, the OP\\_CAT instruction:\r\n\r\n1. Pops the top two values off the stack,\r\n2. concatenates the popped values together in stack order,\r\n3. and then pushes the concatenated value on the top of the stack.\r\n\r\nOP\\_CAT fails if there are fewer than two values on the stack or if a concatenated value would have a combined size greater than the maximum script element size of 520 bytes.\r\n\r\nSee [BIP 347](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki) for a deeper description.\r\n\r\n### Errors thrown\r\n\r\nIf evaluated OP\\_CAT can throw the following errors:\r\n\r\n- If at time of evaluation the stack has fewer than two elements we throw the error: `SCRIPT_ERR_INVALID_STACK_OPERATION`\r\n- If at time of evaluation the top two stack elements have a combined size greater than `MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE` (520 bytes) we throw the error: `SCRIPT_ERR_PUSH_SIZE`.\r\n\r\n### Script verification flags\r\n\r\nWhile this PR does not contain any miner signaling and activation logic and can not activate OP\\_CAT, it does contain two flags which future activation logic could set to control activation of OP\\_CAT.\r\n\r\n- `SCRIPT_VERIFY_OP_CAT` IF a bitcoin node has this set to true, then it treat OP\\_CAT enabled for Tapscript. That is, OP\\_SUCCESS126 will be redefining to OP\\_CAT in Tapscript. If this was set to true at the consensus level this would cause a soft fork.\r\n\r\n`SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT` When set to true, a node receiving any Tapscript transaction containing the opcode OP\\_CAT or OP\\_SUCCESS126 will reject the transaction throwing the error `SCRIPT_ERR_DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT` but not banning the node which relayed the transaction. This prevents nodes from relaying transactions with OP\\_CAT. This  is equivalent to the behavior of `SCRIPT_ERR_DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT = true` when `SCRIPT_VERIFY_OP_CAT = false` as OP\\_CAT is an OP\\_SUCCESS (OP\\_SUCCESS126).\r\n\r\nThis is how these two flags are intended to be used to ensure a smooth soft fork.\r\n\r\n| Stage | `SCRIPT_VERIFY OP_CAT` | `SCRIPT_VERIFY DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT` | Status |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| **1.Default** | False | True | This does not represent any change in behavior of the bitcoin-core node. |\r\n| **2.Upgrading** | True | True | OP\\_CAT is activating. |\r\n| **3.Upgraded** | True | False | It is clear that OP\\_CAT has been activated and the network has been upgraded. |\r\n\r\nThe flag `SCRIPT_ERR_DISCOURAGE_OP_CAT` provides a window of time for the network to fully activate, before nodes will relay or accept transactions containing OP\\_CAT in their mem pools.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a suite of script tests to ensure that OP\\_CAT functions as expected. In the JSON script tests (`script_tests.json`), we test:\r\n\r\n- That if OP\\_CAT is not activated that there are no changes to bitcoin consensus.\r\n- That regardless of the activation or non-activation of OP\\_CAT in Tapscript, pre-Tapscript scripts, i.e. Bitcoin scripts, have no changes in behavior.\r\n- That OP\\_CAT when evaluated throws the expected error when there are less than two elements on the stack.\r\n- That OP\\_CAT when evaluated in a variety of circumstances and edge cases, successfully concatenates elements of the stack. This includes:\r\n  - multiple calls to OP\\_CAT in a row,\r\n  - evaluating OP\\_CAT inside of a IF conditional,\r\n  - evaluating OP\\_CAT on zero size stack elements, random and large stack elements,\r\n  - evaluating OP\\_CAT on values being moved to and from the alt stack,\r\n  - and checking that when evaluated OP\\_CAT concatenates the elements in the expected order.\r\n\r\nAll of these tests are designed to cover the happy path of OP\\_CAT, the various errors which OP\\_CAT can throw and all the corner cases between those two outcomes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we include three tests outside of the JSON script tests.\r\n\r\n- `cat_simple` and `cat_empty_stack` are designed to test OP\\_CAT outside of the JSON serialization regime. Ensure that we catch bugs that we might miss in the JSON script tests due to a bug introduced at the JSON serialization layer.\r\n- `cat_dup_test` enumerates all stack element sizes from 1 to 522 bytes and then enumerates up to 10 repetitions of `OP\\_DUP OP\\_CAT`. It then tests if the stack element would exceed 520 bytes and if so did OP\\_CAT throw the error `SCRIPT_ERR_PUSH_SIZE`. This allows us to be certain that OP\\_CAT will not introduce any `OP\\_DUP OP\\_CAT` memory exhaustion attacks.\r\n\r\n### Better Tapscript tests in JSON script tests\r\n\r\nWhile writing these JSON script tests (`script_tests.json`) we ran into the following problem. The JSON script tests are simple and easy to write for pre-Tapscript scripts, but adding or changing a Tapscript test requires substantial work per test.\r\nConsider the following pre-tapscript test:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\"'aa' 'bb'\", \"CAT 0x4c 0x02 0xaabb EQUAL\", \"P2SH,STRICTENC\", \"DISABLED_OPCODE\", \"CAT disabled\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas a Tapscript test for the same script (annotated with comments for better readability) would look like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    [\r\n        \"aa\",\r\n        \"bb\",\r\n        \"7e4c02aabb87\", // output script\r\n        \"c0d6889cb081036e0faefa3a35157ad71086b123b2b144b649798b494c300a961d\", // control block\r\n        0.00000001\r\n    ],\r\n    \"\",\r\n    \"0x51 0x20 0x15048ed3a65748549c27b671936987093cf73a4c9cb18522a74fb9553060ca99\", // Tapscript output\r\n    \"P2SH,WITNESS,TAPROOT\",\r\n    \"OK\",\r\n    \"TAPSCRIPT CATs aa and bb together and checks if EQUAL to aabb\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nComputing the Tapscript output, such as `0x51 0x20 0x15048ed3a65748549c27b671936987093cf73a4c9cb18522a74fb9553060ca99`, requires writing custom code and running it for each test. The same is true for the Tapscript control block, such as `c0d6889cb081036e0faefa3a35157ad71086b123b2b144b649798b494c300a961d`. If a test is changed or updated new outputs and control blocks must be computed. The complexity of doing this is likely the reason that no one has added any Tapscript tests to JSON script tests until this PR.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we address this issue by adding the following improvements to JSON script tests:\r\n\r\n- Adding simple macros (`\"#SCRIPT#` and `#CONTROLBLOCK#`) that allow the script test parser to automatically generate and inject a valid Tapscript output and control block to be computed automatically from the JSON script.\r\n- Allowing Tapscript scripts to use the human readable strings like pre-script scripts by marking the location of the script in the witness stack using `#SCRIPT#`. This transforms the unreadable script `7e4c02aabb87` into `#SCRIPT# CAT 0x4c 0x02 0xaabb EQUAL`.\r\n\r\nThis results in the following JSON script test which is far easier to write and easier to read.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    [\r\n        \"aa\",\r\n        \"bb\",\r\n        \"#SCRIPT# CAT\",\r\n        \"#CONTROLBLOCK#\",\r\n        0.00000001\r\n    ],\r\n    \"\",\r\n    \"0x51 0x20 #TAPROOTOUTPUT#\",\r\n    \"P2SH,WITNESS,TAPROOT,OP_CAT\",\r\n    \"OK\",\r\n    \"TAPSCRIPT Test of OP_CAT flag by calling CAT on two elements. TAPSCRIPT_OP_CAT flag is set so CAT is executed.\"\r\n],\r\n```\r\n  \r\n",
