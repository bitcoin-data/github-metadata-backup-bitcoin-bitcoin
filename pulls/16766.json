    "body": "This slightly modifies the behavior of IsTrusted to recursively check the parents of a transaction. Otherwise, it's possible that a parent is not IsTrusted but a child is. If a parent is not trusted, then a child should not be either.\r\n\r\nThis recursive scan can be a little expensive, so ~it might be beneficial to have a way of caching IsTrusted state, but this is a little complex because various conditions can change between calls to IsTrusted (e.g., re-org).~ I added a cache which works per call/across calls, but does not store the results semi-permanently. Which reduces DoS risk of this change. There is no risk of untrusted parents causing a resource exploitation, as we immediately return once that is detected.\r\n\r\nThis is a change that came up as a bug-fix esque change while working on OP_SECURETHEBAG. You can see the branch where this change is important here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...JeremyRubin:stb-with-rpc?expand=1. Essentially, without this change, we can be tricked into accepting an OP_SECURETHEBAG output because we don't properly check the parents. As this was a change which, on its own, was not dependent on OP_SECURETHEBAG, I broke it out as I felt the change stands on its own by fixing a long standing wallet bug.\r\n\r\nThe test wallet_balance.py has been corrected to meet the new behavior. The below comment, reproduced, explains what the issue is and the edge cases that can arise before this change.\r\n\r\n        # Before `test_balance()`, we have had two nodes with a balance of 50\r\n        # each and then we:\r\n        #\r\n        # 1) Sent 40 from node A to node B with fee 0.01\r\n        # 2) Sent 60 from node B to node A with fee 0.01\r\n        #\r\n        # Then we check the balances:\r\n        #\r\n        # 1) As is\r\n        # 2) With transaction 2 from above with 2x the fee\r\n        #\r\n        # Prior to #16766, in this situation, the node would immediately report\r\n        # a balance of 30 on node B as unconfirmed and trusted.\r\n        #\r\n        # After #16766, we show that balance as unconfirmed.\r\n        #\r\n        # The balance is indeed \"trusted\" and \"confirmed\" insofar as removing\r\n        # the mempool transactions would return at least that much money. But\r\n        # the algorithm after #16766 marks it as unconfirmed because the 'taint'\r\n        # tracking of transaction trust for summing balances doesn't consider\r\n        # which inputs belong to a user. In this case, the change output in\r\n        # question could be \"destroyed\" by replace the 1st transaction above.\r\n        #\r\n        # The post #16766 behavior is correct; we shouldn't be treating those\r\n        # funds as confirmed. If you want to rely on that specific UTXO existing\r\n        # which has given you that balance, you cannot, as a third party\r\n        # spending the other input would destroy that unconfirmed.\r\n        #\r\n        # For example, if the test transactions were:\r\n        #\r\n        # 1) Sent 40 from node A to node B with fee 0.01\r\n        # 2) Sent 10 from node B to node A with fee 0.01\r\n        #\r\n        # Then our node would report a confirmed balance of 40 + 50 - 10 = 80\r\n        # BTC, which is more than would be available if transaction 1 were\r\n        # replaced.\r\n\r\nThe release notes have been updated to note the new behavior.",

      "body": "I updated the tests to pass.\r\n\r\nIn the test, we  have two nodes with a balance of 50 each and then:\r\n\r\nSend 40 from node A to node B.\r\nSend 60 from node B to node A.\r\n\r\nThen we would check the balances.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we would immediately report a balance of 30 on node B as unconfirmed and trusted.\r\n\r\nNow, we show that balance as unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nThe balance is indeed \"trusted\" and \"confirmed\" insofar as removing the mempool transactions would return *at least* that much money. But the current software marks it as unconfirmed because the 'taint' tracking of transaction trust for summing balances doesn't consider which inputs belong to a user.\r\n\r\nI think the new behavior is correct; we shouldn't be treating those funds as confirmed. If you want to *rely* on that specific UTXO existing which has given you that balance, you cannot, as a third party spending the other input would destroy that unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nOverall I think that this points to a general concept worth exploring as a revision to the categories \"unconfirmed\" and \"confirmed\", to have \"free cash\", \"locked\", and \"unconfirmed\". Free cash can be spent at will, locked funds are balances that are guaranteed to exist but we don't have a confirmed UTXO for yet, and unconfirmed are funds we may or may not receive. I think this is out of scope of this PR though, but is worth further thought.",

Note we also abort as soon as we find an offending tx. It might be better to do this via BFS than DFS, but DFS is simpler to implement.\r\n\r\nNote that a third party can't force a long-chain lookup on you without your participation, because you're checking IsMine at each level. So an unconfirmed spend to you will look back only until it's a transaction with another participant that's unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to use an unordered_set here -- but perhaps that's better done as something across the module (std::set/map is used extensively)",

But I don't understand what originally motivated this change. Is there a prototypical example of a case where this would be an obvious improvement? The test example in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16766#issuecomment-527563982 seems more like arguably correct behavior with not a great outcome. I wouldn't mind seeing:\r\n\r\n- The PR description updated with more motivation, and maybe a motivating example\r\n- A release note to warn users and avoid surprises from balances being computed differently than before\r\n\r\nI like the proposed free/locked/unconfirmed idea, too. I hope future changes could allow figuring out a free+locked value, which has seemed to me like a useful thing to have before https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15010#issuecomment-47689238.",

      "body": "Hi @ryanofsky, thanks for the review!\r\n\r\nThis is a change that came up as a bug-fix esque change while working on OP_SECURETHEBAG. You can see the branch where this change is important here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...JeremyRubin:stb-with-rpc?expand=1. Essentially, without this change, we can be tricked into accepting an OP_SECURETHEBAG output because we don't properly check the parents.\r\n\r\nAs this was a change which, on its own, was not dependent on OP_SECURETHEBAG, I broke it out as I felt the change stands on its own.\r\n\r\nI'll add to the release notes and to the tests comments.",

Don't know about the DoS protection, see comment.\r\n\r\n> Overall I think that this points to a general concept worth exploring as a revision to the categories  \"unconfirmed\" and \"confirmed\", to have \"free cash\", \"locked\", and \"unconfirmed\". Free cash can  be spent at will, locked funds are balances that are guaranteed to exist but we don't have a confirmed UTXO for yet, and unconfirmed are funds we may or may not receive. I think this is out of scope of this PR though, but is worth further thought\r\n\r\nAgree, UTXO state management is pretty unclear currently, I was thinking about this on the spending-side to rework `abandontransaction` to something like `abandonutxo` with the given nomenclature, _committed_ UTXO included in one or more tx, _spent_ UTXO include in a confirm tx, where user should be able to unlock committed UTXO if they are his. Conflicts tracking should stay at the transaction-level. On the receiving-side, not sure about the difference between _locked_ and _unconfirmed_",
