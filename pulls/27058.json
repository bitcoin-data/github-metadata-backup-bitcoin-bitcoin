    "body": "Currently the `verify-commits.py` script does not work well with maintainers giving up their commit access. If a key is removed from `trusted-keys`, any commits it signed previously will fail to verify, however keys cannot be kept in the list as it would allow that person to continue to push new commits. Furthermore, the `trusted-keys` used depends on the working tree which `verify-commits.py` itself may be modifying. When the script is run, the `trusted-keys` may be the one that is intended to be used, but the script may change the tree to a different commit with a different `trusted-keys` and use that instead!\r\n\r\nTo resolve these issues, I've updated `verify-commits.py` to load the `trusted-keys` file and check the keys itself rather than delegating that to `gpg.sh` (which previously read in `trusted-keys`). This avoids the issue with the tree changing.\r\n\r\nI've also updated the script so that it stops modifying the tree. It would do this for the clean merge check where it would checkout each individual commit and attempt to reapply the merges, and then checking out the commit given as a cli arg. `git merge-tree` lets us do basically that but without modifying the tree. It will give us the object id for the resulting tree which we can compare against the object id of the tree in the merge commit in question. This also appears to be quite a bit faster.\r\n\r\nLastly I've removed all of the exception commits in `allow-revsig-commits`, `allow-incorrect-sha512-commits`, and `allow-unclean-merge-commits` since all of these predate the commits in `trusted-git-root` and `trusted-sha512-root`. I've also updated the script to skip verification of commits that predate `trusted-git-root`, and skip sha512 verification for those that predate `trusted-sha512-root`.",

See [inline discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27058#discussion_r1099900493) and [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27076#issuecomment-1426761886). I don't like having to update the root trusted commit every time the maintainer list changes.\r\n\r\nImo we should only bump it if a former maintainer revokes their key or it expires, plus maybe every couple of years to preempt such issues. As @MarcoFalke suggested people can do this with `git checkout \"$(cat contrib/verify-commits/trusted-git-root)~1\"` (and override verification script with the new version). But I'd rather avoid that friction.\r\n\r\nOne heuristic for when it's ok to change the root trusted commit could be the branch-off commit for the oldest release branch that we still support backports to.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke [wrote](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27076#issuecomment-1426768304):\r\n\r\n> What would the alternative be? Listing hundreds or thousands of \"revsig\" commits in a file, to ensure it is impossible to review manually, only with special git commands, potentially making it trivial to sneak in malicious commits that are not actually revsig commits? And then, as you say, bump the root anyway later.\r\n\r\nThis script doesn't protect against maintainer collusion. But doesn't the CSV remove the need for revsig commits?\r\n\r\nTested with `contrib/verify-commits/verify-commits.py HEAD~4`. It indeed seems a bit faster. Still have to test some other things.\r\n\r\n",

They are free to not touch their script after the root is bumped and continue using the previous script+data; they  are free to pick the latest data from the `master` branch, once and if they agree with it; they are also free to pick any other trusted git root according to their own needs (this is what I do).\r\n\r\nIn fact, everyone using the same trusted root (or encouraging people to do so via a workflow) makes it trivial for a single merge commit to short-circuit out all history (by treating all of history as one pull request), without the script even noticing (unless you are using a different root).",

Even if I whitelist myself, the sha256 tree will complain, as it should.\r\n\r\nWe should merge this before #27135 for easier verification of the past ~year.",

That way it will use the trusted keys at the time.\r\n\r\nI suggest we merge this and then later rethink how we want to handle changing maintainers.\r\n\r\ntACK bb86887527d817ee2a015863ddf3541dac42080f",

The problem is median time past is in the past; a timestamp proof is a **stronger** statement if it's backdated, not weaker.\r\n\r\nInstead, the OpenTimestamps client rounds off timestamps to the nearest day in the local timezone to give users the right impression about the accuracy of OTS proofs, without getting into the UI complexity of having timestamps with dates apparently in the future. For an automated tool, adding a day to the block time and interpreting the timestamp as proof that some data existed prior to that point in time could be a reasonable approach.",

So I guess you'd also have to document a faketime where the script still passes? Moreover, the key might be purged from keyservers if it is expired/revoked, so you may also have to document the full key here. Not sure if we want this.\r\n\r\nIt seems easier to just bump the trusted root, like it was done before, see d4b3dc5b0a726cc4cc7a8467be43126e78f841cf\r\n\r\nThe trusted root hash commits to all previous commits, so there shouldn't be any downside, compared to listing a subset of commits prior to the trusted root hash.\r\n\r\nOf course anyone is free to archive previous keys as long as they want and re-run gpg on previous commits, with or without faketime, as often as they want. But doing that once as part of the review process of bumping the trusted root should be enough. I don't see a need to maintain every key forever.\r\n\r\nOverall I think, the script should ideally be easy to understand and use, so that many users can read and use it. It is already hard enough to properly run the script (just one example: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25197#issuecomment-1137097923 ; happy to provide more examples), so adding even more complexity and failure modes will mean that likely no one is running it in practice, let alone understand it and be able to act on errors if there are any.",

Though, I think there is no easy way out of manually reviewing (and manually taking over! [1]) changes to this script and the data it uses. So optimizing for an easy and repeatable review process should be priority, to allow as many people to repeat it as possible. Otherwise, if the review process is different for each occasion, it is impossible to document and hard to follow. I do think it probably makes sense to allow for one-off rare exceptions (unclean merge, unsigned merge, wrong sha512, ...), which can be used during the review process of bumping the trusted root, but I think will complicate stuff if they are needed to be maintained for the whole history at the HEAD commit forever. (Note that anyone can check out an earlier version to get them for a previous commit, even if they are removed from HEAD)\r\n\r\n> We could drop the key and update the trusted root to the current HEAD, but are we okay with doing that?\r\n\r\nI'd say yes. There is no way out of doing a change on short notice. And then, whether reviewers review the `until` commit, or the trusted root, which will be equal to the `until` commit, shouldn't make a difference?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Blindly checking out the script on the fetched/downloaded/merged git commit is next to useless, unless you are the CI doing a smoke test.",
