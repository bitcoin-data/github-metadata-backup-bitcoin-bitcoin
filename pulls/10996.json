    "body": "Adds a per-net network.conf as per #9374 ; this is pretty much the same as #9402 which was closed for lack of interest.\r\n\r\nIt's somewhat interesting in the context of #10994 because it provides somewhere to stick the network-specific vbignore settings. Unless I'm missing something, I don't think #10267 provides an easy way of doing per-network config files, so wouldn't work well for that particular use case.\r\n\r\nThis patch doesn't include any tests, so is marked as WIP. There's some test code in #10267 that would presumably be able to be adapted pretty easily.",

Giving an error if regtest/testnet is specified in network.conf would probably be better, but seems like it violates the abstraction layer a fair bit...)",

      "body": "@jnewbery Hmm, looking at #10267 in a bit more detail, the current patch seems to only allow a single includeconf directive to have an effect anyway, rather than multiple includes or recursive includes; so you could actually get the same effect as that patch with this one by just giving an absolute path to the netconf directory here. It doesn't look to me like there's really much difficulty in combining the two patches either once one or the other gets merged (I'm not seeing much room for either to get much simpler, though -- you still have to finish loading bitcoin.conf then load the chain params to work out which network you're on before you can load the right network.conf).",

The main benefits to having the option are (a) it makes it easier to test (can just specify different config files to check different behaviour, rather than having to move files around), and (b) it means it shows up when you say --help so people have some chance of knowing it exists. I think that's enough to justify having the option, but happy to drop it if people think that makes it simpler.",
