Or so I understood it at least :-)\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9962#issuecomment-285332911:\r\n\r\n> In principle it is good to fix comment typos, but my preference too would be to either catch them at the source (review the PR and find them) so that they never get merged in the first place or bunch them up into something like a \"fix typos\" pull every few weeks.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9962#issuecomment-285334709:\r\n\r\n> […] This allows live cooperation on fixing typos without involving the maintainers at every step.\r\n\r\nAlso @fanquake requested an automated solution in #10419:\r\n\r\n> Im curious. What tool are you using to find these? I assume it's being run in some automated way on the repository when new changes are merged? Why not merge the open pull requests instead, catch the typos/incorrect includes etc etc and then advise changes in the PRs while they are still open?",

          "body": "This implements the compact block filter construction in [BIP 158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki). The code is not used anywhere in the Bitcoin Core code base yet. The next step towards [BIP 157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki) support would be to create an indexing module similar to `TxIndex` that constructs the basic and extended filters for each validated block.\r\n\r\n### Filter Sizes\r\n\r\n[Here](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRqaAAQZ5ZX5eqxP7J2R1MzFrc2WDdKSWJEKtQzyawqog) is a CSV of filter sizes for blocks in the main chain.\r\n\r\nAs you can see below, the ratio of filter size to block size drops after the first ~150,000 blocks:\r\n\r\n![filter_sizes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/881253/42900589-299772d4-8a7e-11e8-886d-0d4f3f4fbe44.png)\r\n\r\nThe reason for the relatively large filter sizes is that Golomb-coded sets only achieve good compression with a sufficient number of elements. Empirically, the average element size with 100 elements is 14% larger than with 10,000 elements.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of filter size to block size is computed without witness data for basic filters. Here is a summary table of filter size ratios *for blocks after height 150,000*:\r\n\r\n| Stat | Filter Type |\r\n|-------|--------------|\r\n| Weighted Size Ratio Mean | 0.0198 |\r\n| Size Ratio Mean | 0.0224 |\r\n| Size Ratio Std Deviation | 0.0202 |\r\n| Mean Element Size (bits) | 21.145 |\r\n| Approx Theoretical Min Element Size (bits) | 21.025 |",
