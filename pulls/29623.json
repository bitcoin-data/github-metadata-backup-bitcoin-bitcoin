    "body": "[An earlier approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/1d226ae1f984c5c808f5c24c431b959cdefa692e/) in #28956 involved simplifying and refactoring the network-adjusted time calculation logic, but this was eventually [left out](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28956#issuecomment-1904214370) of the PR to make it easier for reviewers to focus on consensus logic changes.\r\n\r\nSince network-adjusted time is now only used for warning/informational purposes, cleaning up the logic (building on @dergoegge's approach in #28956) should be quite straightforward and uncontroversial. The main changes are:\r\n\r\n- Previously, we would only calculate the time offset from the first 199 outbound peers that we connected to. This limitation is now removed, and we have a proper rolling calculation. I've reduced the set to 50 outbound peers, which seems plenty.\r\n- Previously, we would automatically use the network-adjusted time if the difference was < 70 mins, and warn the user if the difference was larger than that. Since there is no longer any automated time adjustment, I've changed the warning threshold to ~~20~~ 10 minutes (which is an arbitrary number).\r\n- Previously, a warning would only be raised once, and then never again until node restart. This behaviour is now updated to  1) warn to log for every new outbound peer for as long as we appear out of sync, 2) have the RPC warning toggled on/off whenever we go in/out of sync, and 3) have the GUI warn whenever we are out of sync (again), but limited to 1 messagebox per 60 minutes\r\n- no more globals\r\n- remove the `-maxtimeadjustment` startup arg\r\n\r\nCloses #4521",

          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

          "title": "Broadcast own transactions only via short-lived Tor or I2P connections",
          "body": "To improve privacy, broadcast locally submitted transactions (from the `sendrawtransaction` RPC) to the P2P network only via Tor or I2P short-lived connections.\r\n\r\n* Introduce a new connection type for private broadcast of transactions with the following properties:\r\n  * started whenever there are local transactions to be sent\r\n  * only opened to Tor or I2P peers\r\n  * opened regardless of max connections limits\r\n  * after handshake is completed one local transaction is pushed to the peer, `PING` is sent and after receiving `PONG` the connection is closed\r\n  * ignore all incoming messages after handshake is completed (except `PONG`)\r\n\r\n* Broadcast transactions submitted via `sendrawtransaction` using this new mechanism, to a few Tor or I2P peers. Keep doing this until we receive an `INV` about this transaction from one of our ordinary peers (this takes about 1 second on mainnet).\r\n\r\n* The transaction is stored in peerman and does not enter the mempool.\r\n\r\n* Once we get an `INV` from somebody, then the normal flow executes: we request the transaction with `GETDATA`, receive it with a `TX` message, put it in our mempool and broadcast it to all our existent connections (as if we see it for the first time).\r\n\r\n* After we receive the full transaction as a `TX` message, in reply to our `GETDATA` request, only then consider the transaction has propagated through the network and remove it from the storage in peerman, ending the private broadcast attempts.\r\n\r\nThe messages exchange should look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx-sender >--- connect -------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERSION -------> tx-recipient (dummy VERSION with no revealing data)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERSION -------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- WTXIDRELAY ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDADDRV2 ----< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- SENDTXRCNCL ---< tx-recipient (maybe)\r\ntx-sender <--- VERACK --------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- VERACK --------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- TX ------------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender >--- PING ----------> tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender <--- PONG ----------< tx-recipient\r\ntx-sender disconnects\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a new transaction is received from `sendrawtransaction` RPC, the node will send it to 5 (`NUM_PRIVATE_BROADCAST_PER_TX`) recipients right away. If after 10-15 mins we still have not heard anything about the transaction from the network, then it will be sent to 1 more peer (see `PeerManagerImpl::ReattemptPrivateBroadcast()`).\r\n\r\nA few considerations:\r\n* The short-lived private broadcast connections are very cheap and fast wrt network traffic. It is expected that some of those peers could blackhole the transaction. Just one honest/proper peer is enough for successful propagation.\r\n* The peers that receive the transaction could deduce that this is initial transaction broadcast from the transaction originator. This is ok, they can't identify the sender.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome explanation of the commits:\r\n\r\n* New logging category and config option to enable private broadcast\r\n  * `log: introduce a new category for private broadcast`\r\n  * `init: introduce a new option to enable/disable private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `CConnman` side:\r\n  * `net: introduce a new connection type for private broadcast`\r\n  * `net: move peers counting before grant acquisition in ThreadOpenConnections()`\r\n  * `net: implement opening PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n\r\n* Prepare `BroadcastTransaction()` for private broadcast requests:\r\n  * `net_processing: rename RelayTransaction to better describe what it does`\r\n  * `node: change a tx-relay on/off flag to a tri-state`\r\n  * `net_processing: store transactions for private broadcast in PeerManager`\r\n\r\n* Implement the private broadcast connection handling on the `PeerManager` side:\r\n  * `net_processing: reorder the code that handles the VERSION message`\r\n  * `net_processing: handle ConnectionType::PRIVATE_BROADCAST connections`\r\n  * `net_processing: stop private broadcast of a transaction after round-trip`\r\n  * `net_processing: retry private broadcast`\r\n\r\n* Engage the new functionality from `sendrawtransaction`:\r\n  * `rpc: use private broadcast from sendrawtransaction RPC if -privatebroadcast is ON`\r\n\r\n* Independent test framework improvements (also opened as a standalone PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29420):\r\n  * `test: improve debug log message from P2PConnection::connection_made()`\r\n  * `test: extend the SOCKS5 Python proxy to actually connect to a destination`\r\n  * `test: support WTX INVs from P2PDataStore and fix a comment`\r\n  * `test: set P2PConnection::p2p_connected_to_node in peer_connect_helper()`\r\n\r\n* New functional test that exercies some of the new code:\r\n  * `test: add functional test for local tx relay`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis addresses:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3828 Clients leak IPs if they are recipients of a transaction\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14692 Can't configure bitocoind to only send tx via Tor but receive clearnet transactions\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19042 Tor-only transaction broadcast onlynet=onion alternative\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24557 Option for receive events with all networks, but send transactions and/or blocks only with anonymous network[s]?\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25450 Ability to broadcast wallet transactions only via dedicated oneshot Tor connections\r\n\r\nRelated, but different:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21876 Broadcast a transaction to specific nodes\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28636 new RPC: sendrawtransactiontopeer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_A previous incarnation of this can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27509. It puts the transaction in the mempool and (tries to) hide it from the outside observers. This turned out to be too error prone or maybe even impossible._\r\n",

          "body": "Parent PR #29432 \r\n\r\nThis is the first part of the Stratum v2 Template Provider change that can be a standalone pull request.\r\n\r\nThe Noise Protocol Framework is defined here: https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html\r\n\r\nIt's quite similar to BIP324. The main differences are explained here, including why Stratum v2 can't use BIP234 (yet): https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stratum-v2-noise-protocol-bip324-nuggets/413\r\n\r\nThe implementation is based on revision 38, 2018-07-11 (most recent at the time of writing).\r\n\r\nThe Stratum v2 spec defines the specific choice of ciphers: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/04-Protocol-Security.md\r\n\r\nThis protocol has been implemented in the Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI, using [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin)). https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum\r\n\r\nIt has also been (independently) implemented in BraiinsOS. This part is currently not open source, and it's behind on some recent changes.\r\n\r\nThe classes in `sv2_noise.h` attempt to stay close to the paper, whereas the test and fuzzer code borrow heavily from BIP324.\r\n\r\nIt's ready for review, but not for merge:\r\n\r\n1. The parent PR may need more conceptual review (and perhaps the entire spec, but that would really slow things down)\r\n2. We could decide to not support Noise encryption at all and require users to install separate software for that. Code review of this PR could help inform that decision.\r\n\r\nYou can see this code in action in the parent PR #29432.\r\n\r\nInitial seed corpus: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/169\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe following spec change is already implemented in this PR and in SRI:\r\n\r\n* The spec is being modified to use EllSwift (instead of regular x-only) for the encoding of public keys and ECDH: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66",

Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Move `Split` functions from `util/spanparsing.h` to `util/string.h`, using `util` namespace for clarity.\r\n- Move remaining spanparsing functions to `script/parsing.h` since they are used for descriptor and miniscript parsing.\r\n- Combine `util/fees.h` and `util/errors.h` into `common/messages.h` so there is a place for simple functions that generate user messages to live, and these functions are not part of the util library.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change is that the util library is a dependency of the kernel, and we should remove functionality from util that shouldn't be called by kernel code or kernel applications. These changes should also improve code organization and make functions easier to discover. Some of these same moves are (or were) part of #28690, but did not help with code organization, or made it worse, so it is better to move them and clean them up in the same PR so code only has to change one time.\r\n",

This is the most recent time that this peer was the first to notify our node of a new block (one that we didn't already know about), or zero if this peer has never been the first to notify us of a new block. This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet. I think having both kinds of tests would be beneficial.",

This can cause [an issue where the unpersisted chainstate must be resynced if bitcoind is not cleanly shut down](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11600#issue-271011834). If using a large enough `dbcache`, it's possible the entire chainstate from genesis would have to be resynced.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the issue by persisting the chainstate to disk right after syncing to tip, but not clearing the utxo cache (using the `Sync` method introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17487). This happens by scheduling a call to the new function `SyncCoinsTipAfterChainSync` every 30 seconds. This function checks that the node is out of IBD, and then checks if no new block has been added since the last call. Finally, it checks that there are no blocks currently being downloaded by peers. If all these conditions are met, then the chainstate is persisted and the function is no longer scheduled.\r\n\r\nResolves #11600.",

          "body": "The `bitcoin-config.h` includes have issues:\r\n\r\n* The header is incompatible with iwyu, because symbols may be defined or not defined. So the `IWYU pragma: keep` is needed to keep the include when a symbol is not defined on a platform. Compare the previous discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29408#issuecomment-1948959711\r\n* Guarding the includes by `HAVE_CONFIG_H` is verbose and brittle. Now that all build config dependencies have been removed from low level headers, the benefits are questionable, and the guard can be removed. The linter could also be tricked by guarding the include by `#if defined(HAVE_C0NFIG_H)` (`O` replaced by `0`). Compare the previous discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29404#discussion_r1483189853 . ",

Since there is no longer any automated time adjustment, I've changed the warning threshold to 20 minutes (which is an arbitrary number).\r\n\r\non the 2 value selections (50 outbound peers):\r\n- 50 sounds reasonable, to be fair best would be to add timestamp in `m_outbound_time_offsets` from `FEELER` connection, it’s an outbound connection type per se. shuffling things more at the AS-level.\r\n- 20 min, i can suggest to pick up 10 min to match average interval-block-time of ~10 min",

          "body": "The current procedure for building the block filter index involves processing filters one at a time;\r\nReading blocks, undo data, and previous headers from disk sequentially.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new mechanism to perform the work concurrently. Dividing the filters\r\ngeneration workload among a pool of workers that can be configured by the user,\r\nsignificantly increasing the speed of the index construction process.\r\n\r\nThe same concurrent processing model has been applied to the transactions index as well.\r\n\r\nThe newly introduced init flag `-indexworkers=<n>` enables the concurrent sync\r\nbehavior.\r\nWhere \"n\" is the number of worker threads that will be spawned at startup to create ranges\r\nof block filters during the initial sync process. Destroying the workers pool once the\r\ninitial sync completes.\r\nNote: by default, the parallelized sync process is not enabled.\r\n\r\nNow the juicy part:\r\nIn my computer, with the node in debug mode and on IBD, with `-indexworkers=4`, the\r\nblock filter index generation took less than an hour. While, in master, the sync took more than 7 hours.\r\n\r\nImportant Note:\r\nAs the access to the block data on disk is protected by `cs_main`, this new feature runs substantially\r\nfaster when the node is not in IBD.\r\n\r\nFootnote:\r\nThis is part of a larger project :).",

Doing one more small force-push to patch the fuzz and unit test to:\r\n- disable logging in the fuzz test, which was causing the memory leak (thanks @dergoegge)\r\n- use `noui.h` to prevent the GUI from flooding the fuzz and unit test with (expected) warnings\r\n\r\nIt's a pretty small test-only diff, so I'm hoping reviewers can give this a quick re-review?

The main changes are:\r\n- RPC warnings are properly reset when the issue is resolved, GUI warnings can now be shown more than once (e.g. when the node falls out of sync again), but only once per 60 minutes to prevent flooding.\r\n- the warning message has been improved to make it more clear what the user has to/can do\r\n- re-added debug log whenever an offset is added (i.e. an outbound peer connects)",

      "body": "Thank you very much @sr-gi @maflcko @vasild @glozow @mzumsande for your extensive review.\r\n\r\nForce pushed to address all review comments:\r\n- in GUI: display the warning along with other warnings, instead of in a messagebox. This prevents the warning from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29623#discussion_r1551733252 (and is a nicer approach in general)\r\n- various nits around improved documentation, variable naming, references, help messages, ...\r\n- I probably won't be addressing nits in this PR anymore to minimize review burden, so if there are any left (please keep posting them if you see any) I'll keep them for a follow-up.\r\n\r\n> Also, qt/guiutils.h still refers to CNodeCombinedStats.nTimeOffset\r\n\r\nReferences updated, thanks\r\n\r\n> Wrt adjusting the peer's offset with local clock corrections in order to stop the warnings immediately after the local clock is fixed (instead of after 4-5h) https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29623#discussion_r1544783265, consider this:\r\n\r\nI like the idea of using steady_clock here, but I would prefer to do it in a follow-up if there's appetite for it. It's nice to have the warning disappear more quickly when the issue is resolved, but I think a downside is that the timeoffset peer stats in GUI and RPC will be inconsistent with the ones we use for the warning. I'd started implementing a PeerClock approach based on your suggestion, and I think it's quite elegant, but it's a lot more code overhaul so not really ideal for this PR.

          "body": "The RPC documentation for `getblockchaininfo`, `getmininginfo` and `getnetworkinfo` states that \"warnings\" returns \"any network and blockchain warnings\". In practice, only a single warning (i.e. the latest one that is set) is returned, the other ones are ignored.\r\n\r\nFix that by returning all warnings as an array.\r\n\r\nAs a side benefit, clean up the GetWarnings() logic.\r\n\r\nSince this PR changes the RPC result schema, I've added release notes. Users can temporarily revert to the old results by using `-deprecatedrpc=warnings`, until it's removed in a future version.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome historical context from git log:\r\n\r\n- when `GetWarnings` was introduced in 401926283a200994ecd7df8eae8ced8e0b067c46, it was used in the `getinfo` RPC, where only a [single error/warning was returned](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/401926283a200994ecd7df8eae8ced8e0b067c46#diff-7442c48d42cd5455a79915a0f00cce5e13359db46437a32b812876edb0a5ccddR250) (similar to how it is now).\r\n- later on, \"warnings\" RPC response fields were introduced, e.g. in ef2a3de25c882396e1776b554878d2784b6b7391, with the description [stating](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ef2a3de25c882396e1776b554878d2784b6b7391#diff-1021bd3c74415ad9719bd764ad6ca35af5dfb33b1cd863c0be49bdf52518af54R411) that it returned \"any network warnings\" but in practice still only a single warning was returned",

Run the command as follows:\r\n```\r\ngit checkout f918ccb8d3711b04e0b8c214846bbedb0f90b8aa\r\ngit rebase -i --autosquash eb0bdbdd753bca97120247b921fd29d606fea6e9\r\n```\r\nThere are a few conflicts that have to be resolved.\r\n\r\n2. Squash the _\"cmake [FIXUP]: Move `find_program(brew)` out from introspection file\"_ commit manually by pulling its changes into the two earlier commits: _\"cmake: Add wallet functionality\"_ and _\"cmake: Build `bitcoin-qt` executable\"_.\r\n\r\n3. Reorder the recent commits to pop up the docs and CI changes.\r\n\r\n4. Port build system changes from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29623.",

If the user does something in an attempt to resolve the issue, how would they know that the issue is resolved? Usually if a message is logged every, e.g. 10 minutes (to avoid flooding the log), the disappearance of the message is an indication that the problem is resolved.\r\n\r\nIs there a way for the user to see the median network time, as perceived by his node? If yes, then they can manually compare.\r\n\r\nAlso, the time offset issue is one that can come and go as time passes. Imagine a `bitcoind` running for 1 month. It had issues with the time soon after it was started which the operator has resolved. 1 month later the issues resurface - there is no warning or indication about it?\r\n\r\nMaybe replace that `bool` with a timestamp of the last log and print the error message if the last log was e.g. 10 minutes ago?",

      "body": "For GUI and RPC warnings, this PR pretty much preserves the current behaviour: GUI messagebox gets shown only once (until restarted), and the RPC will keep firing forever (on master, it will be reset when another `SetMiscWarning()` is called, but in practice I don't think that really happens frequently).\r\n\r\nFor the debug log, however, this PR quite significantly improves things by\r\n1) doing an actual rolling calculation, which means that if clocks start drifting, the user will eventually still get a warning, whereas on master the time adjustment system completely stops after the first 199 outbound handshakes\r\n2) producing repeated log warnings (one for every outbound handshake) for as long _and only for as long_ as the median time offset exceeds the threshold.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree that for GUI & RPC things should be improved, this PR is no regression, and I'd rather it be done in a separate PR. Avoiding flooding seems less trivial to me than adding a simple timer: having a GUI message popup every 10 minutes is quite annoying if someone decides to flood the network with nodes with wrong clocks.\r\n\r\n> Is there a way for the user to see the median network time, as perceived by his node?\r\n\r\nyes, through `getnetworkinfo` a user can see the median offset\r\n\r\n> 1 month later the issues resurface - there is no warning or indication about it?\r\n\r\nthere will be warning logs every time we handshake with an outbound peer and the median timeoffset exceeds the threshold",

Since this is about the median, I guess 101 new connections after fixing the clock will be enough for us to stop the warning. That is like 20ish hours. Quite long. Can we do better?\r\n\r\nCurrently we only save the difference between our time and the peer's time at the start of the connection and we have no clue that this difference has changed due to our clock being adjusted/corrected. If we save the value of the system_clock and steady_clock at the start of the connection, in addition to the peer's offset, at a later time we can deduce that our clock has been adjusted and add that diff/adjustment to the peer's offset to immediately figure out that \"now our clock is in sync with that peer's clock\".\r\n\r\nSo, instead of `peer_offset`, it would be a matter of using the following instead:\r\n`peer_offset + steady_clock_diff - system_clock_diff`, assuming:\r\n`steady_clock_diff = steady_clock_now - steady_clock_when_connected`\r\n`system_clock_diff = system_clock_now - system_clock_when_connected`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n---\r\nLets say our clock is wrong, 15 minutes ahead. When we connect to a peer at `17:00:00` our time they send us a time that is 15 minutes ago and we save:\r\n`peer_offset = -15min`,\r\n`system_clock_when_connected = 17:00:00`,\r\n`steady_clock_when_connected = 1000` (some obscure value [seconds]).\r\nOne hour later, our clock has been fixed/corrected, by moving it 15 min backwards (or stopping to move for 15 min). So,\r\n`system_clock_now = 17:45:00`,\r\n`steady_clock_now = 4600` (the obscure value 1000 plus 3600 because 1 hour has passed).\r\nAnd then:\r\n`steady_clock_diff = 4600 - 1000 = 60 min`\r\n`system_clock_diff = 17:45:00 - 17:00:00 = 45 min`\r\nThe difference between those is 15 minutes and adding that to `peer_offset` gives us offset 0, meaning that now our clock is in sync with the peer's clock.",

This behavior doesn't seem ideal to me, I wonder if it wouldn't be better to display a warning in the GUI that is non blocking.",

I hadn't considered the blocking nature being a problem, and you're right that this PR makes the problem more apparent since the waiting threshold is reduced significantly.\r\n\r\nI've removed the messagebox altogether, and updated the approach to properly use the `GetWarnings()` method to show the warning in the GUI. I think this simplifies the code, prevents blocking, and makes for nicer UI.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"756\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/69010457/6e479864-c9c4-4100-99e1-cb77b1792ecb\">\r\n",
