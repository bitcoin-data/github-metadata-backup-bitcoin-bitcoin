    "body": "**This PR is a simple 3-line scripted diff followed by a documentation cleanup.** The scripted diff does three things:\r\n\r\n1. Deletes all existing `AssertLockHeld` calls. Since #19668, `AssertLockHeld` has had an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation which has guaranteed (though ongoing travis and cirrus CI builds since #19668 was merged) that these `AssertLockHeld` calls are redundant with `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` or `EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_FUNCTION` annotations already present in surrounding code, and specifically that:\r\n\r\n  - There is no way the assert calls can trigger any behavior at runtime.\r\n  - The assert calls provide no new thread safety information to the compiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Reverts `AssertLockHeld` implementation which got changed in #19668 to it's original pre-#19668 state. In #19668, `AssertLockHeld` was changed to have an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation instead of having an `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` annotation. As described above, having an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation on an assert statement is only useful as proof that the assert statement doesn't do anything or convey any new information. By contrast, having an `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` annotation on an assert statement can be an actually useful way of conveying to the compiler than a specific mutex is locked at a specific place in the code, when the compiler thread safety analysis can't determine that on its own (because of lost type information).\r\n\r\n3. Removes `LockAssertion` class, replacing all current uses with calls to `AssertLockHeld`. Ever since the `LockAssertion` class was first introduced in #14437 (as `LockAnnotation`), it has always been an inferior alternative to `AssertLockHeld` and not had a reason to exist. (#14437 was originally written before #13423 which added ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK annotation. It was justified when the code was first written, but no longer necessary by the time it was merged).\r\n\r\n**Motivation for this PR** is to get rid of confusion between different types of lock assertions and only keep one assertion: `AssertLockHeld` which goes back to the implementation it's had since #13423 was merged until #19668 was merged. After this PR, `AssertLockHeld` only needs to be used sparingly to augment compile-time thread safety annotations, which are a superior alternative to runtime checks for guaranteeing thread safety.\r\n\r\nPR is compared with alternatives in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/AssertLockHeld-PRs",

          "body": "Currently we use an `unordered_map<uint256, CBlockIndex*>` for our BlockMap. This is a bit of a peculiar choice because we then store a pointer to the uint256 from the pair inside of the CBlockIndex. It would be conceptually simpler if we used a `unordered_map<CBlockIndex>` and modified `CBlockIndex` to directly own the uint256 for the phashBlock.\r\n\r\nThat's what this patch attempts doing. The only additional complexity is where we do want to query the map by key, the key equivalence stuff is only in C++20, so we add a helper that lets us construct a mock element easily for using with find.\r\n\r\nThe result is nicer since we get rid of an additional indirection for accessing the phashblock and we get rid of a lot of std::pair de-structuring. We also save a bit of memory per index (I haven't computed it precisely, but my guess is we save something like 24 bytes total per index by eliminating 1 pointer, which saves 8 bytes, and then could save us something like 16 bytes of padding). We also no longer can be in an inconsistent state where phashblock does not point to the entries own hash (although modifying phashblock once it is inserted into the map would be invalid -- it must be removed, modified, and reinserted).\r\n\r\nFuture work can likely further improve on this by making CBlockIndex owned* by the unordered_set directly, which will eliminate even more indirection/pointer chasing and make a lot of the code using BlockMap simpler (I don't think we ever rely on CBlockIndex being non-owned anywhere, nor should we have reason to in the future).\r\n\r\n\r\n* see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_set, it will still be safe to use pointers for e.g., pprev.\r\n```\r\n     References and pointers to data stored in the container are only invalidated by erasing that element, even when the corresponding iterator is invalidated. \r\n```",

The current code has `AssertLockHeld` and `AssertLockNotHeld` behave in the same way (a runtime check that the mutex is held by this thread or not), which is worth preserving imo.\r\n\r\nThe updated docs in doc/developer-notes.md would also need updating if this change were to be merged.",

      "body": "I agree with @ajtowns' [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19668#discussion_r483287210):\r\n> We have three types of assertions related for locking:\r\n> \r\n>  - marking a function as `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` has a compile time check with clang that the caller has already obtained the lock\r\n> \r\n>  - declaring a `LockAssertion` instance overrides the clang compile time checks by saying that we've already somehow acquired the lock in a way that we can't prove via clang thread safety annotations. This is useful for lambda functions (which could be annotated) that are called from some generic dispatcher like `ForEach` (that can't be annotated).\r\n> \r\n>  - adding a call to `AssertLockHeld` does a runtime check if DEBUG_LOCKORDER is enabled. it's annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED so is redundant with the compile time checks, but the compile time checks aren't available outside of clang. it's automatically called from LockAssertion to ensure that the compile time checks aren't overridden incorrectly.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> As a result:\r\n> \r\n>  - using AssertLockHeld everywhere remains fine, and no longer needlessly disables the compile time checks\r\n> \r\n>  - LockAssertion should only be used very rarely -- and in fact it's only used in net_processing in some ForEach/ForEachNode functions.\r\n\r\nProbably, `AssertLockHeld` deserves a better name, but its functionality and usage are ok.\r\n\r\n`EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` is used in a header file. If a function definition is placed in a `*.cpp` file, using `AssertLockHeld` has the following benefits (besides a run time check):\r\n- it shows to a code reader the expected state of lock without referencing to a header file\r\n- it will warn about missed proper `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation\r\n\r\n`AssertLockHeld` is a great tool to transit from `RecursiveMutex` to `Mutex` in a safe and proven manner. See: #19303, #19833, #19854.\r\n\r\nConcept NACK.",

USDTs ( not the stablecoin :sweat_smile: )\r\n\r\nThe linux kernel can hook into these tracepoints at runtime, but otherwise they have little to no performance impact. Traces can pass data which can be printed externally via tools such as bpftrace. For example, here's one that prints incoming and outgoing network messages:\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\n## Network Messages\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bpftrace\r\n\r\nBEGIN\r\n{\r\n  printf(\"bitcoin net msgs\\n\");\r\n  @start = nsecs;\r\n}\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/bitcoind:net:push_message\r\n{\r\n  $ip = str(arg0);\r\n  $peer_id = (int64)arg1;\r\n  $command = str(arg2);\r\n  $data_len = arg3;\r\n  $data = buf(arg3,arg4);\r\n  $t = (nsecs - @start) / 100000;\r\n\r\n  printf(\"%zu outbound %s %s %zu %d %r\\n\", $t, $command, $ip, $peer_id, $data_len, $data);\r\n\r\n  @outbound[$command]++;\r\n}\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/bitcoind:net:process_message\r\n{\r\n  $ip = str(arg0);\r\n  $peer_id = (int64)arg1;\r\n  $command = str(arg2);\r\n  $data_len = arg3;\r\n  $data = buf(arg3,arg4);\r\n  $t = (nsecs - @start) / 100000;\r\n\r\n  printf(\"%zu inbound %s %s %zu %d %r\\n\", $t, $command, $ip, $peer_id, $data_len, $data);\r\n\r\n  @inbound[$ip, $command]++;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    $ sudo bpftrace netmsg.bt\r\n\r\noutput: https://jb55.com/s/b11312484b601fb3.txt\r\n\r\nif you look at the bottom of the output you can see a histogram of all the messages grouped by message type and IP. nice!\r\n\r\n## IBD Benchmarking\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bpftrace\r\nBEGIN\r\n{\r\n  printf(\"IBD to 500,000 bench\\n\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/bitcoind:CChainState:ConnectBlock\r\n{\r\n  $height = (uint32)arg0;\r\n\r\n  if ($height == 1) {\r\n    printf(\"block 1 found, starting benchmark\\n\");\r\n    @start = nsecs;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if ($height >= 500000) {\r\n    @end = nsecs;\r\n    @duration = @end - @start;\r\n    exit();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nEND {\r\n  printf(\"duration %d ms\\n\", @duration / 1000000)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis one hooks into ConnectBlock and prints the IBD time to height 500,000 starting from the first call to ConnectBlock\r\n\r\nUserspace static tracepoints give lots of flexibility without invasive logging code. It's also more flexible than ad-hoc logging code, allowing you to instrument many different aspects of the system without having to enable per-subsystem logging.\r\n\r\nOther ideas: tracepoints for lock contention, threads, what else?\r\n\r\nLet me know what ya'll think and if this is worth adding to bitcoin.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] docs?\r\n- [x] Integrate systemtap-std-dev/libsystemtap into build (provides the <sys/sdt.h> header)\r\n- [x] ~dtrace macos support?

      "body": "If a function definition is placed in a `*.cpp` file, using `AssertLockHeld` has the following benefits (besides a run time check):\r\n> \r\n> * it shows to a code reader the expected state of lock without referencing to a header file\r\n> * it will warn about missed proper `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation\r\n\r\nYou are literally talking about adding an annotation to check for the presence of another annotation. This is an absurd idea to me, but to take it seriously, what should the developer guidelines say about using AssertLockHeld this way? Should every function that is annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED also have an AssertLockHeld at the top? Is there going to be a linter to check for this, or is this going to be another source of nits in review comments?\r\n\r\n> `AssertLockHeld` is a great tool to transit from `RecursiveMutex` to `Mutex` in a safe and proven manner. See: #19303, #19833, #19854.\r\n\r\nBefore the lock annotations added in #19668 this was true. It was a good way to discover where to add EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED annotations. But now those annotations are added AssertLockHeld is only functioning as annotation checking the presence of another annotation, and doesn't impact the work in those other PRs or improve thread safety in any way.",

      "body": "> While migrating from `RecursiveMutex` to `Mutex` how one could be confident in the fact that a mutex is actually locked without run time assertion?\r\n\r\nIf it is annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED, it seems you should be confident either that the mutex is actually locked or that LockAssertion was used earlier and would have triggered a runtime error where it was used. This PR isn't removing all runtime checks, just runtime checks redundant with compile time checks. AssertLockHeld is still available whenever you want to use it. It just returns to functioning like a normal runtime check, and not a strange compile time check enforcing the presence of a different compile time check. I can see how the strange check was useful during development of #19668, but it doesn't serve a purpose for thread safety going forward or help with future PRs.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make an argument for keeping all AssertLockHelds based on readability, that's fine, but then I think you should make a developer guideline saying that AssertLockHeld should be called first thing in any function annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED, and ideally have a linter to enforce this. Otherwise if the assert is only used in some places but not others, that is just adding confusion and inconsistency.",

Though, you correctly say that travis will compile with clang and fail if there is an inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThe redundant run time checks also serve as a insurance against bugs in clang.\r\n\r\nIdeally, they'd be inserted by the compiler whenever a function is annotated. Though, I don't see a way to do this in C++ without wrapping everything into more macros. Another option would be to have a preprocessing step in our ci scripts to insert the redundant run-time checks in enable-debug builds. At least that would make me feel more comfortable removing them.",

If a function is annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(mutex), and the developer is not using clang, and the developer makes a change that calls the function without locking `mutex`, having a redundant AssertLockHeld(mutex) isn't going to impact the thread safety of the codebase, because CI ensures we will not merge this code.\r\n\r\nSo you are uncomfortable about the inconvenience that removing asserts which are already haphazardly and inconsistently placed will cause for developers who are not using clang, but who are building in debug mode, and who are removing locks or calling functions in new places, and who are doing some kind of manual or automated testing that would happen to trigger these assertions at runtime?\r\n\r\nOr uncomfortable about something different?\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "We managed to misuse the compiler directives:\r\n\r\n* Our `AssertLockHeldInternal()` does a runtime check and would not return (aka `abort()`) if it fails. There is an attribute exactly for that: [ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#assert-capability-and-assert-shared-capability), but we don't use it. We use [EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#requires-requires-shared), meant for something else. This is a misuse because `AssertLockHeldInternal()` does not do anything that requires holding the mutex (like reading variables protected by that mutex).\r\n\r\n* Our `LockAssertion::LockAssertion()` does the same as `AssertLockHeldInternal()`, but is tagged with [EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_FUNCTION](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#acquire-acquire-shared-release-release-shared). A misuse because `LockAssertion()` does not acquire the mutex.\r\n\r\nI think we shouldn't be doing that for no matter what reason - misleading the compiler that we do one thing while we do another.\r\n\r\nThe OP in #19668 boils down to:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n 1 int x GUARDED_BY(cs_main);\r\n 2\r\n 3 void f() // not annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_main)\r\n 4 {\r\n 5     // AssertLockHeld was properly annotated with ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK() before #19668\r\n 6     AssertLockHeld(cs_main);\r\n 7\r\n 8     // no warning here that we access x without holding cs_main\r\n 9     x = 5;\r\n10 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compiler does not issue a compile-time warning for line 9 because it knows line 9 is unreachable at run-time if `cs_main` is not held - `AssertLockHeld()` from line 6 would not return in that case. IMO we shouldn't try to extort the compiler to produce a warning here. Mis-labeling `AssertLockHeld()` with `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED()` only to ensure that `f()` has that attribute indeed looks like [adding an annotation to check for the presence of another annotation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19865#issuecomment-687192979).\r\n\r\nI agree with @MarcoFalke that clang may have bugs and we better not have it as our sole protection. The thread safety analysis look a bit immature to me - for example the warnings produced [depend on the order in which attributes are defined](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19668#discussion_r467244459) (:-O). IMO [compile time checks are good and they are an addition to runtime checks, not a replacement](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19647#discussion_r468442853).\r\n\r\nWhat about going back to using the proper attributes? Tag `AssertLockHeldInternal()` with `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` when `DEBUG_LOCKORDER` is defined and no attributes otherwise (because it is a noop, don't fool the compiler) and remove the confusing `LockAssertion()`?",

      "body": "@vasild \r\n> @ajtowns this is because of another misuse (or \"trying to fool the compiler\") - in `master` before #19668 in the non-`DEBUG_LOCKORDER` case `AssertLockHeldInternal()` was defined like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```c++\r\n> void static inline AssertLockHeldInternal(...) ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK(cs) {}\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> So, we lied the compiler that we will check and `abort()`, but we did not do that.\r\n> \r\n> In this case, IMO `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK()` should not be present. Then line 9 is reachable _and we get a compilation warning_.\r\n\r\nSo, the 23d71d171e6e22ba5e4a909d597a54595b2a2c1f commit from the #19668 is a correct change, and it should not be reverted, right?",

We're trying to prevent buggy code, by in order of preference, (a) making it impossible to write (eg RAII so locks are free automatically); (b) making the compiler complain about it (eg thread safety annotations); (c) getting predictable safe errors at runtime rather than crashes, hangs or undefined behaviour that only happen randomly (eg lock order checks).\r\n\r\nIn our code, it's never correct to call `AssertLockHeld` (that is as it stands prior to this PR, not after `LockAssertion` is renamed) without already holding the lock, so the additional behaviours allowed by ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK aren't helpful, and make it easier to write buggy code.",
