    "body": "**This PR is a simple 3-line scripted diff followed by a documentation cleanup.** The scripted diff does three things:\r\n\r\n1. Deletes all existing `AssertLockHeld` calls. Since #19668, `AssertLockHeld` has had an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation which has guaranteed (though ongoing travis and cirrus CI builds since #19668 was merged) that these `AssertLockHeld` calls are redundant with `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` or `EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_FUNCTION` annotations already present in surrounding code, and specifically that:\r\n\r\n  - There is no way the assert calls can trigger any behavior at runtime.\r\n  - The assert calls provide no new thread safety information to the compiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Reverts `AssertLockHeld` implementation which got changed in #19668 to it's original pre-#19668 state. In #19668, `AssertLockHeld` was changed to have an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation instead of having an `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` annotation. As described above, having an `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation on an assert statement is only useful as proof that the assert statement doesn't do anything or convey any new information. By contrast, having an `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` annotation on an assert statement can be an actually useful way of conveying to the compiler than a specific mutex is locked at a specific place in the code, when the compiler thread safety analysis can't determine that on its own (because of lost type information).\r\n\r\n3. Removes `LockAssertion` class, replacing all current uses with calls to `AssertLockHeld`. Ever since the `LockAssertion` class was first introduced in #14437 (as `LockAnnotation`), it has always been an inferior alternative to `AssertLockHeld` and not had a reason to exist. (#14437 was originally written before #13423 which added ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK annotation. It was justified when the code was first written, but no longer necessary by the time it was merged).\r\n\r\n**Motivation for this PR** is to get rid of confusion between different types of lock assertions and only keep one assertion: `AssertLockHeld` which goes back to the implementation it's had since #13423 was merged until #19668 was merged. After this PR, `AssertLockHeld` only needs to be used sparingly to augment compile-time thread safety annotations, which are a superior alternative to runtime checks for guaranteeing thread safety.\r\n\r\nPR is compared with alternatives in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/AssertLockHeld-PRs",

This is useful for lambda functions (which could be annotated) that are called from some generic dispatcher like `ForEach` (that can't be annotated).\r\n> \r\n>  - adding a call to `AssertLockHeld` does a runtime check if DEBUG_LOCKORDER is enabled. it's annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED so is redundant with the compile time checks, but the compile time checks aren't available outside of clang. it's automatically called from LockAssertion to ensure that the compile time checks aren't overridden incorrectly.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> As a result:\r\n> \r\n>  - using AssertLockHeld everywhere remains fine, and no longer needlessly disables the compile time checks\r\n> \r\n>  - LockAssertion should only be used very rarely -- and in fact it's only used in net_processing in some ForEach/ForEachNode functions.\r\n\r\nProbably, `AssertLockHeld` deserves a better name, but its functionality and usage are ok.\r\n\r\n`EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` is used in a header file. If a function definition is placed in a `*.cpp` file, using `AssertLockHeld` has the following benefits (besides a run time check):\r\n- it shows to a code reader the expected state of lock without referencing to a header file\r\n- it will warn about missed proper `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED` annotation\r\n\r\n`AssertLockHeld` is a great tool to transit from `RecursiveMutex` to `Mutex` in a safe and proven manner. See: #19303, #19833, #19854.\r\n\r\nConcept NACK.",

This PR isn't removing all runtime checks, just runtime checks redundant with compile time checks. AssertLockHeld is still available whenever you want to use it. It just returns to functioning like a normal runtime check, and not a strange compile time check enforcing the presence of a different compile time check. I can see how the strange check was useful during development of #19668, but it doesn't serve a purpose for thread safety going forward or help with future PRs.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make an argument for keeping all AssertLockHelds based on readability, that's fine, but then I think you should make a developer guideline saying that AssertLockHeld should be called first thing in any function annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED, and ideally have a linter to enforce this. Otherwise if the assert is only used in some places but not others, that is just adding confusion and inconsistency.",

      "body": "I think by default `./configure` will pick up gcc, which does not check lock annotations, so the current `AssertLockHeld` in master have a slight benefit of telling `./configure --enable-debug` devs (with gcc) who run the tests before creating a pull that something with their locks is wrong. Though, you correctly say that travis will compile with clang and fail if there is an inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThe redundant run time checks also serve as a insurance against bugs in clang.\r\n\r\nIdeally, they'd be inserted by the compiler whenever a function is annotated. Though, I don't see a way to do this in C++ without wrapping everything into more macros. Another option would be to have a preprocessing step in our ci scripts to insert the redundant run-time checks in enable-debug builds. At least that would make me feel more comfortable removing them.",

If a function is annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(mutex), and the developer is not using clang, and the developer makes a change that calls the function without locking `mutex`, having a redundant AssertLockHeld(mutex) isn't going to impact the thread safety of the codebase, because CI ensures we will not merge this code.\r\n\r\nSo you are uncomfortable about the inconvenience that removing asserts which are already haphazardly and inconsistently placed will cause for developers who are not using clang, but who are building in debug mode, and who are removing locks or calling functions in new places, and who are doing some kind of manual or automated testing that would happen to trigger these assertions at runtime?\r\n\r\nOr uncomfortable about something different?\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "We managed to misuse the compiler directives:\r\n\r\n* Our `AssertLockHeldInternal()` does a runtime check and would not return (aka `abort()`) if it fails. There is an attribute exactly for that: [ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#assert-capability-and-assert-shared-capability), but we don't use it. We use [EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#requires-requires-shared), meant for something else. This is a misuse because `AssertLockHeldInternal()` does not do anything that requires holding the mutex (like reading variables protected by that mutex).\r\n\r\n* Our `LockAssertion::LockAssertion()` does the same as `AssertLockHeldInternal()`, but is tagged with [EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_FUNCTION](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#acquire-acquire-shared-release-release-shared). A misuse because `LockAssertion()` does not acquire the mutex.\r\n\r\nI think we shouldn't be doing that for no matter what reason - misleading the compiler that we do one thing while we do another.\r\n\r\nThe OP in #19668 boils down to:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n 1 int x GUARDED_BY(cs_main);\r\n 2\r\n 3 void f() // not annotated with EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_main)\r\n 4 {\r\n 5     // AssertLockHeld was properly annotated with ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK() before #19668\r\n 6     AssertLockHeld(cs_main);\r\n 7\r\n 8     // no warning here that we access x without holding cs_main\r\n 9     x = 5;\r\n10 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compiler does not issue a compile-time warning for line 9 because it knows line 9 is unreachable at run-time if `cs_main` is not held - `AssertLockHeld()` from line 6 would not return in that case. IMO we shouldn't try to extort the compiler to produce a warning here. Mis-labeling `AssertLockHeld()` with `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED()` only to ensure that `f()` has that attribute indeed looks like [adding an annotation to check for the presence of another annotation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19865#issuecomment-687192979).\r\n\r\nI agree with @MarcoFalke that clang may have bugs and we better not have it as our sole protection. The thread safety analysis look a bit immature to me - for example the warnings produced [depend on the order in which attributes are defined](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19668#discussion_r467244459) (:-O). IMO [compile time checks are good and they are an addition to runtime checks, not a replacement](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19647#discussion_r468442853).\r\n\r\nWhat about going back to using the proper attributes? Tag `AssertLockHeldInternal()` with `ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK` when `DEBUG_LOCKORDER` is defined and no attributes otherwise (because it is a noop, don't fool the compiler) and remove the confusing `LockAssertion()`?",

We're trying to prevent buggy code, by in order of preference, (a) making it impossible to write (eg RAII so locks are free automatically); (b) making the compiler complain about it (eg thread safety annotations); (c) getting predictable safe errors at runtime rather than crashes, hangs or undefined behaviour that only happen randomly (eg lock order checks).\r\n\r\nIn our code, it's never correct to call `AssertLockHeld` (that is as it stands prior to this PR, not after `LockAssertion` is renamed) without already holding the lock, so the additional behaviours allowed by ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK aren't helpful, and make it easier to write buggy code.",
