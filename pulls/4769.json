    "body": "I think that the memory buffer used to serialize peer responses should limit the total length to the maximum the peer is willing to accept.  This can help prevent easily DoS-able requests from being added in the future and bringing down every Bitcoin Core node on the network, rather the relying on a soft limit of how big a response can actually be.\n\nOpening this PR so more eyes can look at this, but I'm not able to test whether it actually works as intended.  Don't merge until the error case is actually hit and the behavior is as intended.  In particular, I don't know if that exception is actually caught anywhere, but I have received confirmation that the patch at least compiles.\n",

The peer may even reject the\nresponse for being too large, but as the entire request must stay in\nmemory (to calculate a checksum) before being sent over the network,\nthis can still be a great way to OOM any Bitcoin Core node while it\ncreates huge memory buffers for just a couple unauthenticated\nrequests.\n\nThis change preemptively stops this attack by preventing the network\nsend buffer from expanding past what the peer must be willing to\naccept.\n\nEven if getutxos is removed or reimplemented in a way that does not\ncause bloated responses, this can prevent the attack from ever\noccurring in the future should more ill-thought-out protocol changes\nbe made.",
