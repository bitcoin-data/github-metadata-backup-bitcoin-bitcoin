    "body": "This PR updates the `test/get_previous_releases.py` script to also work on Windows by changing to be pure python rather than using unix tools such as `curl` and `tar`.\r\n\r\nThis enables additional functional tests to run such as `wallet_migration.py`, `mempool_compatability.py` and `wallet_backwards_compatibility.py`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately `feature_unsupported_utxo_db.py` _could_ run but this test requires Bitcoin `v0.14.3` which will not run under windows with emojis in the data directory (as the functional test runner has by default) . This test could be run as it's own step in the ci workflow file and would pass but as it's quite an old version / feature I have assumed it's not worth worrying about and best just to exclude.\r\n\r\nTwo tests needed to be slightly modified to run under windows. Both were issues with trying to overwrite a file that already exists which windows seems to be more strict on than the unix based systems.\r\n\r\nFinally, building from source has been dropped from the `get_previous_releases.py` script. This had not been updated after the move to cmake and so it was assumed that nobody could have been using that feature.",

It also\r\n+ does not support building on Windows, and we are adding support for downloading\r\n+ Windows release binaries in later commits of this PR.\r\n+ \r\n+ As there were no complaints during review, it is assumed nobody uses this\r\n+ functionality.\r\n```\r\nAs the oldest listed in *get_previous_releases.py* is v28.0, meaning it's arguably not that broken.",
