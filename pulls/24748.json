    "body": "This PR introduces support for v2 P2P encryption(BIP 324) in the existing functional test framework and adds functional tests for the same.\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n3. this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    - `v2_state` is the object of class `EncryptedP2PState` in `P2PConnection` used to store its keys, session-id etc.\r\n    - a node [advertising](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#advertising-to-support-v2-p2p) support for  v2 P2P is different from a node actually [supporting v2 P2P](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#supporting-v2-p2p) (differ when false advertisement of services occur)\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `supports_v2_p2p` in `P2PConnection` to denote if it supports v2 P2P.\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `advertises_v2_p2p` to denote whether `P2PConnection` which mimics peer behaviour advertises V2 P2P support. Default option is `False`.\r\n    - In the test framework, you can create Inbound and Outbound connections to `TestNode`\r\n        1. During **Inbound Connections**, `P2PConnection` is the initiator [`TestNode` <--------- `P2PConnection`]\r\n            - Case 1:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` advertises/signals v2 P2P support (means `self.nodes[i]` set up with `\"-v2transport=1\"`), different behaviour will be exhibited based on whether:\r\n                    1. `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P\r\n                    2. `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P\r\n               - In a real world scenario, the initiator node would intrinsically know if they support v2 P2P based on whatever code they choose to run. However, in the test scenario where we mimic peer behaviour, we have no way of knowing if `P2PConnection` should support v2 P2P or not. So `supports_v2_p2p` boolean variable is used as an option to enable support for v2 P2P in `P2PConnection`.\r\n              - Since the `TestNode` advertises v2 P2P support (using \"-v2transport=1\"), our initiator `P2PConnection` would send:\r\n                1. (if the `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                2. (if the `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n           - Case 2:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` doesn't signal v2 P2P support; `P2PConnection` being the initiator would send version message to initiate a connection.\r\n       2. During **Outbound Connections** [TestNode --------> P2PConnection]\r\n           - initiator `TestNode` would send:\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n          - Suppose `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P support when it actually doesn't support v2 P2P (false advertisement scenario)\r\n               - `TestNode` sends ellswift + garbage bytes\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives but can't process it and disconnects.\r\n               - `TestNode` then tries using v1 P2P and sends version message\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives/processes this successfully and they communicate on v1 P2P\r\n\r\n4. the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n5. includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.\r\nAlso written a more elaborate explanation here - https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md",

It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

Hence, increasing the test coverage for chacha20.\r\n\r\nThe idea of using Pybind11 was suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19841#issuecomment-687667841.  This PR is built on top of the [PR draft #21301](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21301) using the changes suggested [here](https://github.com/jesseposner/bitcoin/pull/1).\r\n\r\nTo test this PR, build Bitcoin Core with(out) the wallet and run:\r\n```bash\r\n$ test/functional/test_runner.py \r\n```",

          "body": "block-relay-only connections are additional outbound connections that bitcoind makes since v0.19. They participate in block relay, but do not propagate transactions or addresses. They were introduced in #15759.\r\n\r\nWhen creating an outbound block-relay-only connection, since we know that we're never going to announce transactions over that connection, we can save on memory usage by not a `TxRelay` data structure for that connection. When receiving an inbound connection, we don't know whether the connection was opened by the peer as block-relay-only or not, and therefore we always construct a `TxRelay` data structure for inbound connections.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to tell whether an inbound connection will ever request that we start announcing transactions to it. The `fRelay` field in the `version` message may be set to `0` to indicate that the peer does not wish to receive transaction announcements. The peer may later request that we start announcing transactions to it by sending a `filterload` or `filterclear` message, **but only if we have offered `NODE_BLOOM` services to that peer**. `NODE_BLOOM` services are disabled by default, and it has been recommended for some time that users not enable `NODE_BLOOM` services on public connections, for privacy and anti-DoS reasons.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we have not offered `NODE_BLOOM` to the peer _and_ it has set `fRelay` to `0`, then we know that it will never request transaction announcements, and that we can save resources by not initializing the `TxRelay` data structure.",

          "body": "This is a more minimal, no-frills version of #24734 for backport. The other fixes and improvements in that pull can be done after.\r\n\r\n*Copy of the PR 24734 description:*\r\n\r\nPRs #22736, #22904 and #23223 changed lock contention logging from a `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` compile-time preprocessor directive to a runtime `lock` log category and improved the logging output. This changed the locking from using `lock()` to `try_lock()`:\r\n\r\n- `void Mutex::UniqueLock::lock()` acquires the mutex and blocks until it gains access to it\r\n\r\n- `bool Mutex::UniqueLock::try_lock()` doesn't block but instead immediately returns whether it acquired the mutex; it may be used by `lock()` internally as part of the deadlock-avoidance algorithm\r\n\r\nIn theory the cost of `try_lock` might be essentially the [same](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-697) relative to `lock`. The test-and-set logic of these calls is purported to be ~ constant time, optimised and light/quick if used carefully (i.e. no mutex convoying), compared to system calls, memory/cache coherency and fences, wait queues, and (particularly) lock contentions. See the discussion around https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-902851054 and after with respect to performance/cost aspects.  However, there are reasonable concerns (see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#discussion_r691277896) and [here](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-620)) that `Base::try_lock()` may be potentially [costly](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-700) or [risky](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22904#issuecomment-930484001) compared to `Base::lock()` in this very frequently called code.\r\n\r\nOne alternative to keep the run-time lock logging would be to gate the `try_lock` call behind the logging conditional, for example as proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ccd73de1dd969097d34634c2be2fc32b03fbd09e and ACKed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-901980815). However, this would add the [cost](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-910102353) of `if (LogAcceptCategory(BCLog::LOCK))` to the hotspot, instead of replacing `lock` with `try_lock`, for the most frequent happy path (non-contention).\r\n\r\nIt turns out we can keep the advantages of the runtime lock contention logging (the ability to turn it on/off at runtime) while out of prudence putting the `try_lock()` call and `lock` logging category behind a  `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` compile-time preprocessor directive, and also still retain the lock logging enhancements of the mentioned PRs, as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24734#issuecomment-1085785480 by W. J. van der Laan, in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#discussion_r691280693, and in the linked IRC discussion.\r\n\r\nProposed here and for backport to v23.\r\n",

          "title": "tests: Improve runtime of some tests when `--enable-debug`",
          "body": "When configured with `--enable-debug`, many tests become dramatically slower. These slow downs are particularly noticed in tests that generate a lot of blocks in separate calls, make a lot of RPC calls, or send a lot of data from the test framework's P2P connection. This PR aims to improve the runtime of some of the slower tests and improve the overall runtime of the test runner. This has improved the runtime of the test runner from ~400s to ~140s on my computer.\r\n\r\nThe slowest test by far was `wallet_import_rescan.py`. This was taking ~320s. Most of that time was spent waiting for blocks to be mined and then synced to the other nodes. It was generating a new block for every new transaction it was creating in a setup loop. However it is not necessary to have one tx per block. By mining a block only every 10 txs, the runtime is improved to ~61s.\r\n\r\nThe second slowest test was `feature_fee_estimation.py`. This test spends most of its time waiting for RPCs to respond. I was able to improve its runtime by batching RPC requests. This has improved the runtime from ~201s to ~140s.\r\n\r\nIn `feature_taproot.py`, the test was constructing a Python `CScript` using a very large list of `OP_CHECKSIG`s. The constructor for the Python implementation of `CScript` was iterating this list in order to create a `bytes` from it even though a `bytes` could be created from it without iterating. By making the `bytes` before passing it into the constructor, we are able to improve this test's runtime from ~131s to ~106s.\r\n\r\nAlthough `interface_rpc.py` was not typically a slow test, I found that it would occasionally have a super long runtime. It typically takes ~7s, but I have observed it taking >400s to run on occasion. This longer runtime occurs more often when `--enable-debug`. This long runtime was caused by the \"exceeding work queue\" test which is really just trying to trigger a race condition. In this test, it would create a few threads and try an RPC in a loop in the hopes that eventually one of the RPCs would be added to the work queue while another was processing. It used `getrpcinfo` for this, but this function is fairly fast. I believe what was happening was that with `--enable-debug`, all of the code for receiving the RPC would often take longer to run than the RPC itself, so the majority of the requests would succeed, until we got lucky after 10's of thousands of requests. By changing this to use a slow RPC, the race condition can be triggered more reliably, and much sooner as well. I've used `waitfornewblock` with a 500ms timeout. This improves the runtime to ~3s consistently.\r\n\r\nThe last test I've changed was `rpc_packages.py`. This test was one of the higher runtime variability tests. The main source of this variation appears to be waiting for the test node to relay a transaction to the test framework's P2P connection. By whitelisting that peer, the variability is reduced to nearly 0.\r\n\r\nLastly, I've reordered the tests in `test_runner.py` to account for the slower runtimes when configured with `--enable-debug`. Some of the slow tests I've looked at were listed as being fast which was causing overall `test_runner.py` runtime to be extended. This change makes the test runner's runtime be bounded by the slowest test (currently `feature_fee_estimation.py` with my usual config (`-j 60`).",

          "title": "tracing: Only prepare tracepoint arguments when actually tracing",
          "body": "Currently, if the tracepoints are compiled (e.g. in depends and release builds), we always prepare the tracepoint arguments regardless of the tracepoints being used or not. We made sure that the argument preparation is as cheap as possible, but we can almost completely eliminate any overhead for users not interested in the tracepoints (the vast majority), by gating the tracepoint argument preparation with an `if(something is attached to this tracepoint)`. To achieve this, we use the optional semaphore feature provided by SystemTap.\r\n\r\nThe first commit simplifies and deduplicates our tracepoint macros from 13 TRACEx macros to a single TRACEPOINT macro. This makes them easier to use and also avoids more duplicate macro definitions in the second commit.\r\n\r\nThe Linux tracing tools I'm aware of (bcc, bpftrace, libbpf, and systemtap) all support the semaphore gating feature. Thus, all existing tracepoints and their argument preparation is gated in the second commit. For details, please refer to the commit messages and the updated documentation in `doc/tracing.md`.\r\n\r\nAlso adding unit tests that include all tracepoint macros to make sure there are no compiler problems with them (e.g. some varadiac extension not supported). \r\n\r\nReviewers might want to check:\r\n- Do the tracepoints still work for you? Do the examples in `contrib/tracing/` run on your system (as bpftrace frequently breaks on every new version, please test master too if it should't work for you)? Do the CI interface tests still pass?\r\n- Is the new documentation clear? \r\n- The `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE(event, context)` macros places global variables in our global namespace. Is this something we strictly want to avoid or maybe move to all `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE`s to a separate .cpp file or even namespace? I like having the `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE()` in same file as the `TRACEPOINT()`, but open for suggestion on alternative approaches. \r\n- Are newly added tracepoints in the unit tests visible when using `readelf -n /src/test/test_bitcoin`? You can run the new unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin --run_test=util_trace_tests* --log_level=all`.\r\n<details><summary>Two of the added unit tests demonstrate that we are only processing the tracepoint arguments when attached by having a test-failure condition in the tracepoint argument preparation. The following bpftrace script can be used to demonstrate that the tests do indeed fail when attached to the tracepoints.</summary>\r\n\r\n`fail_tests.bt`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bpftrace\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/test/test_bitcoin:test:check_if_attached {\r\n  printf(\"the 'check_if_attached' test should have failed\\n\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/test/test_bitcoin:test:expensive_section {\r\n  printf(\"the 'expensive_section' test should have failed\\n\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin` and start `bpftrace fail_tests.bt -p $(pidof test_bitcoin)` in a separate terminal. The unit tests should fail with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning 594 test cases...\r\ntest/util_trace_tests.cpp(31): error: in \"util_trace_tests/test_tracepoint_check_if_attached\": check false has failed\r\ntest/util_trace_tests.cpp(51): error: in \"util_trace_tests/test_tracepoint_manual_tracepoint_active_check\": check false has failed\r\n\r\n*** 2 failures are detected in the test module \"Bitcoin Core Test Suite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThese links might provide more contextual information for reviewers:\r\n- [How SystemTap Userspace Probes Work by eklitzke](https://eklitzke.org/how-sytemtap-userspace-probes-work) (actually an example on Bitcoin Core; mentions that with semaphores \"the overhead for an untraced process is effectively zero.\")\r\n- [libbpf comment on USDT semaphore handling](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/blob/1596a09b5de2a50ab8d44218fc29b6d42f886305/src/usdt.c#L83-L92) (can recommend the whole comment for background on how the tracepoints and tracing tools work together)\r\n- https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/UserSpaceProbeImplementation#Semaphore_Handling",

          "body": "This PR rewrites a portion of `test_framework/key.py`, in a compatible way, by introducing classes that encapsulate field element and group element logic, in an attempt to be more readable and reusable.\r\n\r\nTo maximize readability, the group element logic does not use Jacobian coordinates. Instead, group elements just store (affine) X and Y coordinates directly. To compensate for the performance loss this causes, field elements are represented as fractions. This undoes most, but not all, of the performance loss, and there is a few % slowdown (as measured in `feature_taproot.py`, which heavily uses this).\r\n\r\nThe upside is that the implementation for group laws (point doubling, addition, subtraction, ...) is very close to the mathematical description of elliptic curves, and this extends to potential future extensions (e.g. ElligatorSwift as needed by #27479).",

          "body": "This proposes two things:\r\n\r\n1. Make AddrFetch connections to fixed seeds instead of just adding them to AddrMan (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678#issuecomment-1210858925)\r\nWhen adding fixed seeds, we currently add them to AddrMan and then make regular full outbound connections to them. If many new nodes use the fixed seeds for this, it will result in them getting a lot of peers requiring IBD, which will create a lot of traffic for them. With an AddrFetch connection, we will only use them to get addresses from other peers and disconnect afterwards.\r\nThis PR proposes to attempt making AddrFetch connections to 10 peers for better diversity (some may be offline anyway). The fixed seeds will still be added to Addrman as before, but only after a delay of 2 minutes, after which they will hopefully no longer be the only entries in AddrMan.\r\n\r\n2. Move the logic of adding fixed seeds out of `ThreadOpenConnections` into `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` (which is being renamed to `ThreadAddressSeed`).\r\nI think this makes sense in general because adding the fixed seeds is in many ways analogous to querying the DNS seeds, and ThreadOpenConnections, which is there to actually open the connections is already quite complex.\r\nAlso, it makes the changes from 1) easier if we don't have to worry about interfering with the automatic connection making logic.\r\n\r\nOne way to test this is to start without `peers.dat` and run with `-nodnsseed -blocksonly -debug=net` and monitor the debug log and `bitcoin-cli -netinfo` behavior.",

This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.",

          "title": "tracing: network connection tracepoints",
          "body": "This adds five new tracepoints with documentation and tests for network connections:\r\n\r\n- established connections with `net:inbound_connection` and `net:outbound_connection`\r\n- closed connections (both closed by us or by the peer) with `net:closed_connnection`\r\n- inbound connections that we choose to evict with `net:evicted_inbound_connection`\r\n- connections that are misbehaving and punished with `net:misbehaving_connection`\r\n\r\nI've been using these tracepoints for a few months now to monitor connection lifetimes, re-connection frequency by IP and netgroup, misbehavior, peer discouragement, and eviction and more. Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, score_before=0, score_increase=20, message='getdata message size = 50001', threshold_exceeded=false\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",

The `PeerManager` is made to hold a reference to a `ConnectionsInterface` instead of `CConnman`, which makes it possible for us to mock the connection manager in the newly introduced `PeerManager` unit tests. Two initial unit tests are added for the version handshake and ping/pong logic.",

Its benefit is:\r\n\r\n1. It avoids code repetition at the implementation sites. See [PR#26151](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26151) for a live example. Namely this:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Lots of repetitions (92 lines)</summary>\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nclass Foo\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void PushBack(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.push_back(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Foo::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::vector<int> m_data;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Bar\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void PushBack(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.push_back(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Bar::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::vector<std::string> m_data;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Baz\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void Insert(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.insert(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Baz::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::set<std::string> m_data;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nbecomes this:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Short (3 lines)</summary>\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nSynced<std::vector<int>> Foo;\r\nSynced<std::vector<std::string>> Bar;\r\nSynced<std::set<std::string>> Baz;\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n2. The mutex is properly encapsulated. With a global mutex and a global variable annotated with `GUARDED_BY()` it is indeed not possible to add new code that accesses the variable without protection (if using Clang and `-Wthread-safety-analysis` and `-Werror`), but it is possible to abuse the mutex and start using it to protect some more, possibly unrelated stuff (we already have this in the current code).\r\n",

          "body": "A memory resource similar to `std::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource`, but optimized for node-based containers. The goal is to be able to cache more coins with the same memory usage, and allocate/deallocate faster.\r\n\r\nThis is a reimplementation of #22702. The goal was to implement it in a way that is simpler to review & test\r\n\r\n* There is now a generic `PoolResource` for allocating/deallocating memory. This has practically the same API as `std::pmr::memory_resource`. (Unfortunately I cannot use std::pmr because libc++ simply doesn't implement that API).\r\n* Thanks to sipa there is now a fuzzer for PoolResource! On a fast machine I ran it for ~770 million executions without finding any issue.\r\n\r\n* The estimation of the correct node size is now gone, PoolResource now has multiple pools and just needs to be created large enough to have space for the unordered_map nodes.\r\n\r\nI ran benchmarks with #22702, mergebase, and this PR. Frequency locked Intel i7-8700, clang++ 13.0.1 to reindex up to block 690000.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbitcoind -dbcache=5000 -assumevalid=00000000000000000002a23d6df20eecec15b21d32c75833cce28f113de888b7 -reindex-chainstate -printtoconsole=0 -stopatheight=690000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe performance is practically identical with #22702, just 0.4% slower. It's ~21% faster than master:\r\n\r\n![Progress in Million Transactions over Time(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/173288685-91952ade-f304-4825-8bfb-0725a71ca17b.png)\r\n\r\n![Size of Cache in MiB over Time](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/173291421-e6b410be-ac77-479b-ad24-5fafcebf81eb.png)\r\nNote that on cache drops mergebase's memory doesnt go so far down because it does not free the `CCoinsMap` bucket array.\r\n\r\n![Size of Cache in Million tx over Time(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14386/173288703-a80c9c9e-93c8-4a16-9df8-610c89c61cc4.png)\r\n",

          "body": "This PR proposes an early version of [Silent Payment](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8) (author:@RubenSomsen).\r\nIn this scheme, the recipient generates a public address, but the sender tweaks the address and the recipient detects the payment by verifying all transactions on the blockchain. An example use case would be private donations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is not a final version, but to start the discussion and get benchmarks based on a real implementation.\r\n\r\nThis version is built on top of [#994](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/994) (bitcoin-core/secp256k1) for x-only ECDH support and #23480 (bitcoin/bitcoin) for `rawtr()`. Each new silent transaction detected is stored in wallet as a `rawtr()` descriptor. \r\n\r\nIn this implementation, the sender can tweak the recipient address by passing the `silent_payment` option to send RPC. The transaction output will be different from the address entered.\r\n\r\nFor example `./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named send outputs=\"[{\\\"bcrt1pwlh5xuyrpgfunwyww8cfu78yfs2yqyevl7yturavahh5kgxwdd2q5hzgfu\\\": 1.1}]\" fee_rate=1 options=\"{ \\\"silent_payment\\\": true}\"`.\r\n\r\nwill generate `vout` with completely unrelated outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"vout\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 1.10000000,\r\n      \"n\": 0,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(65b19890c5ca40edb816d26f5f48cd9f3ed51121613b1c2405adc1a6dbbc824a)#8myx9tcu\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pvkce3yx9efqwmwqk6fh47jxdnuld2yfpvya3cfq94hq6dkausf9qrfjkgz\",\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 2.02499835,\r\n      \"n\": 1,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(c45cb3d500bbf8f0c8841e8e011b008781d826c16ee348edb822c0f97419bc4d)#26hcce63\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pc3wt84gqh0u0pjyyr68qzxcqs7qasfkpdm353mdcytq0jaqeh3xsuvlykg\",\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny wallet, as long as it has access to private keys, can send silent payments. Thus, this excludes watch-only wallets or wallets with external signers .\r\n\r\nBut the recipient's wallet needs a new flag called `SILENT_PAYMENT`. This flag allows an additional scan that verifies that the wallet keys match the silent payment scheme. When it detects a silent payment that belongs to the wallet, it is stored in a `rawtr()` descriptor.\r\n\r\n`./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named createwallet wallet_name=\"recipient\" silent_payment=true`\r\n\r\nTherefore, scanning each address for each transaction is potentially prohibitive overhead, so the node can be initialized with `keypool=1` or a descriptor with range [0,1] can be imported into a blank wallet. Until there is more benchmark data, it is the safest option. The proposal recommends one static address.\r\n\r\nI've been running some silent payments on signet using wallets with default keypool and default range, I haven't noticed any relevant performance drops on the signet node.\r\nApparently this implementation is working as expected but I can't guarantee that the scheme is implemented correctly or safely, so I'm opening this PR for reviews, modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nThere is a new functional test (`test/functional/wallet_silentpayment.py`) that can help to better understand the implementation.",

          "body": "The Boost 1.81.0 tarball is ~`118`mb, and expands to much larger than that, however we end up with ~`150`mb of headers copied into the `/include/boost` dir in depends. This is a lot by itself, and even more when it's `170`mb * 9 (HOSTS for a guix build).\r\n\r\nWith the changes in this PR, we end up with ~`50`mb of Boost headers in depends, which with some creative patching/pruning, could be trimmed even further. i.e sometimes you end up pulling in an entire boost module, because of a single include in another header we use, but in code that we don't actually need. In other cases there are deprecated headers which are still being used, which could be removed if the modules we care about stopped using them. I will open some PRs upstream to try and improve that situation, ie: https://github.com/boostorg/multi_index/pull/57.",

This increases privacy and will also make it harder to perform fingerprinting attacks (connecting our identities over different networks).\r\n\r\nManual Block-Relay connections:\r\n- can be specified with `-addnode` RPC, both with the `add` and `onetry` command\r\n- can be specified with the `-addnode` bitcoind arg (or in bitcoin.conf) with `<IP>=manual-block-relay`\r\n- don't participate in transaction and address relay\r\n- don't get discouraged / punished for misbehavior (but will still get disconnected for sending TX/tx-INV as automatic block-relay-only peers do)\r\n- are not subject to outbound eviction logic (unlike automatic block-relay-only-peers)\r\n",

Change includes release notes.\r\n\r\nPart of the motivation for this change is to improve usability and prevent settings that look valid from being silently ignored. Another motivation is to be able to remove confusing \"reverse precedence\" logic in #17581",

          "title": "doc: Bump copyright years to present (headers only)",
          "body": "The copyright years have many issues:\r\n\r\n* They may be wrong. For example, this can happen when code is moved from one file to a different one without taking over the copyright years. Or it may happen when the wrong years are inserted by a script or developer.\r\n* They are redundant. `git` already tracks the author date for every line of code in every commit.\r\n* They are not needed to establish \"copyright\", see https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/copyright-notices-in-open-source-software-projects/, or https://reuse.software/faq/#years-copyright. Also, anyone who needs them for legal reasons would need to discover the ground truth themselves anyway. For example, with `git blame`, or `git log ...`, or by other means.\r\n* They cause pointless churn. See for example commit 306ccd4927a2efe325c8d84be1bdb79edeb29b04, or drive-by contributions bumping them.\r\n* Many modern open source software projects never added them in the first place, or already removed them, see section below.\r\n\r\nIn theory they can be removed completely. While this should be legally fine, some contributors raised legal uncertainty. So instead, bump each year range one final time  to `-present` and leave the initial year untouched.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a URL redirect is resolved in the second commit.\r\n\r\nFinally, the `_COPYRIGHT_YEAR` build constant is kept untouched, and still expected to be bumped every year, see for example commit 06dd571534c8ecdf7ade77546fcf3a56b3651f68. In theory it could be bumped to `-present` as well, but this change would cause user-visible changes, so discussion should be done in a separate thread.\r\n\r\nExamples of removed years in other projects:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc (Done before accepting external contributions?)\r\n* https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2bc1d775f510196154283374284f98d3eae03544 (Not legally reviewed?)\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nExamples of no years in other projects:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blame/2d66dc44f5abef975bed86af12cb5facb6729a1a/src/renderer/base/FontInfoBase.cpp#L1\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/33f35b04ef0f32f25624a6be59f8635675e3e131/packages/compiler/src/chars.ts#L3\r\n* https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blame/27b8f54f5174aa4d8ea254a7efefd7110b247c17/clang/lib/Basic/Targets/X86.cpp#L4-L5\r\n* ...",

          "body": "The wallet currently does not know the master key that was used to generate the automatically generated descriptors. This makes it difficult to add new automatically generated descriptors when new ones are introduced. So instead of losing this information after the descriptors are created, have `CWallet` store it. The xpub will be stored in a new `activehdkey` field. The private key must be one of the keys that is used by the descriptors, and will be extracted upon loading.\r\n\r\nAs this is a new field, wallets will be automatically upgraded upon loading. This loading is backwards compatible and uses a new non-required flag `WALLET_FLAG_GLOBAL_HD_KEY` to signal that the upgrade completed. The upgrade will search for an xpub that is shared by `pkh()`, `wpkh()`, and `sh(wpkh()` descriptors with the derivation pattern that we use. For new wallets, the xpub will be set during descriptor creation rather than trying to reverse engineer it. The flag will be set for all wallets, regardless of whether such an xpub was found or can even exist, in order to indicate that the upgrade will not need to be run in the future.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to have a `gethdkey` command which is useful for those who need a simple way to get an xpub from a wallet. `gethdkey` can also take a boolean parameter to indicate whether it should also output the corresponding xprv.\r\n\r\nSupercedes #23417",

The RFC8439 instance is re-keyed every 256 messages for forward secrecy.\r\n* Outer layer uses a forward secure version of ChaCha20, `FSChaCha20` which re-keys itself every 256 messages for forward secrecy. It is used to encrypt the message length resulting in a pseudorandom byte stream.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).",

          "body": "At the moment, the eviction logic is mangled across two different components (`CConnman`, `PeerManager`), so we can't really test it in isolation. This is not completely true for the inbound eviction logic as it exists as static functions in `net.{h.cpp}` for which tests already exist. However, the outbound eviction logic is not covered by any fuzz tests and is only testable by spinning up both a connman and peerman.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits out the eviction logic into its own component `EvictionManager`. In addition to isolating the eviction logic, we get rid of several layer violations (e.g. `CConnman::ForEachNode/ForNode` calls, `CNode::m_last_block_time`, etc.) between `net` and `net processing`.\r\n\r\nOne instance of the `EvictionManager` is created at start up and passed as a reference to the connection and peer managers. The connection and peer managers report all eviction relevant information to the eviction manager who ultimately suggests nodes to evict as the result of `EvictionManager::SelectInboundNodeToEvict` and `EvictionManager::SelectOutboundNodesToEvict`.",

It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).\r\n",

          "body": "**This is a draft PR because it is based on #10102.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`bbefbd3c199b` multiprocess: Add -ipcconnect and -ipcbind options](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19460/commits/bbefbd3c199b189188d6427b4564b17477c6d50e)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBuilding on #10102, this adds an `-ipcconnect` option to `bitcoin-wallet` and an `-ipcbind` option to `bitcoin-node` (both enabled by default in multiprocess builds) so bitcoin node will listen on a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` unix socket, and `bitcoin-wallet` will connect to it.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that `bitcoin-wallet` can be extended in the future to have some online functionality. For example, there could be a `bitcoin-wallet sync` command that will update balances and sync latest transactions to an unloaded wallet, or a `bitcoin-wallet serve` subcommand that loads a wallet and serves RPC requests, or a `bitcoin-wallet shell` subcommand that allows running RPC methods interactively like the GUI console, or just general support for `bitcoin-wallet <rpc method> <rpc params>` invocations suggested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13926#issuecomment-455187379.\r\n\r\nThis PR is small and doesn't do much. The only visible change is that `bitcoin-wallet` now checks whether a node socket exists on startup and prints \"Connected to IPC address\" if it can connect it it.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-wallet` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which connects if possible as described above, and proceeds offline if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to disable ipc, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).\r\n",

This allows the GUI to be started and stopped independently of the node. By default with this change, `bitcoin-gui` will check if a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` socket exists and try to connect to that. If that doesn't work, it will spawn a new node process and start up the same way it did before this PR.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-gui` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which tries to connect if possible as described above, and spawns a new `bitcoin-node` process if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to never connect to an existing node and always spawn a new one, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, basic functionality works and gui instances can connect and disconnect from a running node. But there are rough edges: If a gui process doesn't shut down cleanly, the node can see unhandled IpcExceptions, and if node command line options are passed to `bitcoin-gui` and `bitcoin-gui` connects to an exiting bitcoin-node process instead of spawning a new one, the node options will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).\r\n",

A possibility could be through a net permission flag, if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27114 makes it in.\"\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17167#issuecomment-1168606032 - \"This would allow us to use https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25355 when making outgoing connections to all nodes, except to whitelisted ones for which we would use our persistent I2P address.\"\r\n- Force-relay/mempool permissions for a node you intentionally connected to.\r\n",

The transport is functionally complete, including:\r\n* Autodetection of incoming V1 connections.\r\n* Garbage, both sending and receiving.\r\n* Short message type IDs, both sending and receiving.\r\n* Ignore packets (receiving only, but tested in a unit test).\r\n* Session IDs are visible in `getpeerinfo` output (for manual comparison).\r\n\r\nThings that are not included, left for future PRs, are:\r\n* Actually using the v2 transport for connections.\r\n* Support for the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag.\r\n* Retrying downgrade to V1 when attempted outbound V2 connections immediately fail.\r\n* P2P functional and unit tests\r\n",

          "body": "This pull fixes several peer connection bugs in our p2p code, along with the logging that uncovered them:\r\n\r\n1. Fix detection of inbound peer connections in `GetAddedNodeInfo`.\r\n\r\n2. Fix addnode CJDNS peers not detected in `GetAddedNodeInfo`, causing `ThreadOpenAddedConnections` to continually retry to connect to them and RPC `getaddednodeinfo` incorrectly showing them as not connected.\r\n\r\n3. Fix `ThreadOpenConnections` not detecting inbound CJDNS connections and making automatic outbound connections to them.\r\n\r\n4. Fix detection of already connected peers in `AlreadyConnectedToAddress()`.\r\n\r\n5. Fix detection of already connected peers when making outbound connections in `ConnectNode`.\r\n\r\n6. Do not accept inbound connections in `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket` from I2P peers we're already connected to, as building I2P tunnels is expensive.\r\n\r\n7. Fix making automatic outbound connections in `ThreadOpenConnections` to addnode peers, in order not to allocate our limited outbound slots to them and to ensure addnode connections benefit from their intended protections. Our addnode logic usually connects the addnode peers before the automatic outbound logic does, but not always, as a connection race can occur (see the commit message for further details and mainnet examples). When an addnode peer is connected as an automatic outbound peer and is the only connection we have to a network, it can be protected by our new outbound network-specific eviction logic and persist in the \"wrong role\". Fix these issues by checking if the selected address is an addnode peer in our automatic outbound connection logic.\r\n\r\nUpdate the p2p logging with the improvements that allowed seeing/understanding/debugging the current behavior. Please see the commit messages for details.\r\n\r\nSimplify `MaybePickPreferredNetwork` to return `std::optional`, make it a const class method, and add Clang thread-safety analysis annotation and related assertions.\r\n",

          "title": "net: improves addnode / m_added_nodes logic",
          "body": "## Rationale\r\n\r\nCurrently, `addnode` has a couple of corner cases that allow it to either connect to the same peer more than once, hence wasting outbound connection slots, or add redundant information to `m_added_nodes`, hence making Bitcoin iterate through useless data on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n### Connecting to the same node more than once\r\n\r\nIn general, connecting to the same node more than once is something we should try to prevent. Currently, this is possible via `addnode` in two different ways:\r\n\r\n1. Calling `addnode` more than once in a short time period, using two equivalent but distinct addresses\r\n2. Calling `addnode add` using an IP, and `addnode onetry` after with an address that resolved to the same IP\r\n\r\nFor the former, the issue boils down to `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections` calling `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo` once, and iterating over the result to open connections (`CConman::OpenNetworkConnection`) on the same loop for all addresses.`CConnman::ConnectNode` only checks a single address, at random, when resolving from a hostname, and uses it to check whether we are already connected to it.\r\n\r\nAn example to test this would be calling:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"127.0.0.1:port\" add\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"localhost:port\" add\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd check how it allows us to perform both connections some times, and some times it fails.\r\n\r\nThe latter boils down to the same issue, but takes advantage of `onetry` bypassing the `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections` logic and calling `CConnman::OpenNetworkConnection` straightaway. A way to test this would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"127.0.0.1:port\" add\r\nbitcoin-cli addnode \"localhost:port\" onetry\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Adding the same peer with two different, yet equivalent, addresses\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of `addnode` is pretty naive when checking what data is added to `m_added_nodes`. Given the collection stores strings, the checks at `CConnman::AddNode()` basically check wether the exact provided string is already in the collection. If so, the data is rejected, otherwise, it is accepted. However, ips can be formatted in several ways that would bypass those checks. \r\n\r\nTwo examples would be `127.0.0.1` being equal to `127.1` and `[::1]` being equal to `[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]`. Adding any pair of these will be allowed by the rpc command, and both will be reported as connected by `getaddednodeinfo`, given they map to the same `CService`. \r\n\r\nThis is less severe than the previous issue, since even tough both nodes are reported as connected by `getaddednodeinfo`, there is only a single connection to them (as properly reported by `getpeerinfo`). However, this adds redundant data to `m_added_nodes`, which is undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Parametrize `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo`\r\nFinally, this PR also parametrizes `CConnman::GetAddedNodeInfo` so it returns either all added nodes info, or only info about the nodes we are **not** connected to. This method is used both for `rpc`, in `getaddednodeinfo`, in which we are reporting all data to the user, so the former applies, and to check what nodes we are not connected to, in `CConnman::ThreadOpenAddedConnections`, in which we are currently returning more data than needed and then actively filtering using `CService.fConnected()`\r\n",

          "body": "This PR adds `last_block_announcement` to the per-peer `getpeerinfo` RPC result. This is the most recent time that this peer was the first to notify our node of a new block (one that we didn't already know about), or zero if this peer has never been the first to notify us of a new block. This timestamp already exists internally and is used for stale-tip eviction logic; this PR exposes it at the RPC layer.\r\n\r\nThis PR started out as a suggestion for additional test coverage, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26172#issuecomment-1259678260. It turned out that the easiest way to test (already-merged) #26172 is to add this field to `getpeerinfo` and have a functional test verify its value. But it may also be useful to have this result in its own right, similar to that RPC's existing `last_block` field -- it indicates something about the quality of our peers. It allows one to predict which peer will be evicted when the stale tip logic activates. (I'm not sure if that would be useful, but it may be.)\r\n\r\nThe functional test added here fails without #26172, which is the main goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not test the actual stale-tip eviction logic; that's difficult to do with a functional test. But it does test the correctness of the timestamp that the eviction logic depends on. #23352 is an attempt to test the eviction logic using a unit test, it's not ready to be merged yet. I think having both kinds of tests would be beneficial.",

          "body": "As described in the issues #16418 and #28371, it's a possibility that we could end up having an insufficient number of outbound peers relaying our transactions. Having fewer outbound peers support tx-relay could also have implications on [privacy](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16418#issuecomment-514328042) and fee estimation.\r\n\r\nWhile #28488 is suggesting meaures based on comparing fee filters / mempool sizes, there is also the simpler issue of peers that tell us they don't want transactions, which is determined by the `fRelay` field in the `version` msg. If such a peer runs bitcoin core, that usually means that it's running in `-blocksonly` mode and accepting inbound connections. The status quo is that we will not avoid these peers and just not send them any transactions.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes not to waste any of our 8 full-relay outbound slots on these peers (unless we are in `-blocksonly` mode ourselves). Using them as outbound peers for block-relay-only connections is fine though and not impacted.\r\n\r\nAs was suggested by ajtowns below, we don't disconnect during version processing, but later during the regularly scheduled `EvictExtraOutboundPeers()` task, and only if we are at the maximum of full-outbound peers.\r\n\r\nIf reviewers think that this proposal is too aggressive, an alternative solution (with a little more complexity) would be to restrict the maximum number of outbound connections to `-blocksonly` peers to 1 or 2. Although I currently think that it's ok to be selective with outbound connections, so I didn't implement that right away.",

To keep it simple, we just send in zero-value bytes here and verify that the detection hits exactly after the last bytes is sent.\r\n\r\nAFAICT, with this PR all the v2 transport errors that can be triggered in this simple way of \"just open a socket and send in a fixed byte-string\" are covered. For more advanced test, we need BIP324 cryptography in the test framework in order to perform a v2 handshake etc. (PRs #28374, #24748).",

          "body": "# Session Details\r\n- Date: 16-11-2023\r\n- Time: IST 20:00 (UTC 14:30)\r\n- PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24748\r\n- Context: `p2p` `test`\r\n- Difficulty: intermediate\r\n- Language: `python`\r\n\r\n# Learning\r\nThis is the introductory session for a 2-part review club. The review club will focus on how the functional test framework works on current master and will not cover the changes in [PR #24748](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24748). If this is your first exposure to the test framework, it is recommended to understand the basics discussed in this review club. It's a definite prerequisite to understanding [PR #24748](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24748).\r\n \r\n - Functional test framework\r\n - P2P network\r\n\r\n > Note: Drop your PR and review related suggestions/thoughts/questions below\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n- Bitcoin's functional test framework is a cool tool to spin up nodes and simulate your own network scenario in the regtest.\r\n- Each node would be an actual bitcoind instance and managed by the [python class `TestNode`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eca2e430acf50f11da2220f56d13e20073a57c9b/test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py#L56).\r\n- However we can't customise behaviour of bitcoind. Developers often want to be able to send their own custom response, introduce malicious behaviour and check if error messages were reported, pause and examine bitcoind process etc. The [`P2PInterface` class ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eca2e430acf50f11da2220f56d13e20073a57c9b/test/functional/test_framework/p2p.py#L322) serves this purpose and mocks the behaviour of a peer. It can be easily customised.\r\n- You can connect 2 bitcoind nodes(`TestNode <--> TestNode`) using [`connect_nodes` ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eca2e430acf50f11da2220f56d13e20073a57c9b/test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py#L590)which invokes the `addnode` RPC.\r\n- `P2PInterface` allows custom interaction. You can create inbound/outbound connections to the `TestNode` from your mockable peer.\r\n\t1. Inbound connections to the `TestNode` are made using [`add_p2p_connection()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eca2e430acf50f11da2220f56d13e20073a57c9b/test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py#L637)\r\n\t    - `TestNode <---------- P2PInterface`\r\n\t    - Here, `P2PInterface` is the initiator of the connection\r\n\t2. Outbound connections from the `TestNode` are made using [`add_outbound_p2p_connection()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eca2e430acf50f11da2220f56d13e20073a57c9b/test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py#L677)\r\n\t    - `TestNode ----------> P2PInterface`\r\n\t    - Here, `TestNode` is the initiator of the connection\r\n\r\n# Questions\r\n1. What does this PR do at a high level? Why do we need this PR?\r\n2. Can you trace the functions through which an inbound connection is established in the test framework?\r\n    - hint: see how [`TestNode::add_p2p_connection` ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eca2e430acf50f11da2220f56d13e20073a57c9b/test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py#L637) makes a call to [`peer_connect`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eca2e430acf50f11da2220f56d13e20073a57c9b/test/functional/test_framework/p2p.py#L183)\r\n4. Why is the mechanism to establish an outbound connection in the test framework different? Can you trace the functions through which an outbound connection is established in the test framework?\r\n    - hint: see how [`TestNode::add_outbound_p2p_connection` ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eca2e430acf50f11da2220f56d13e20073a57c9b/test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py#L677) makes a call to [`peer_accept_connection`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eca2e430acf50f11da2220f56d13e20073a57c9b/test/functional/test_framework/p2p.py#L191)\r\n6. How are P2P messages read? How are P2P messages sent?\r\n    - hint: see [`data_received()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eca2e430acf50f11da2220f56d13e20073a57c9b/test/functional/test_framework/p2p.py#L225) and [`send_message()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eca2e430acf50f11da2220f56d13e20073a57c9b/test/functional/test_framework/p2p.py#L273)\r\n8. What is a version handshake? What tools can you use to observe different messages that are exchanged.\r\n9. Briefly explain initial v2 handshake in BIP 324 and when it would need to be done so that P2P messages exchanged are encrypted. \r\n\r\n# Extra reading\r\n1.

So maybe in separate functions within `p2p_v2_transport.py`?\r\n\r\n@maflcko, I still need to address the CI failure. https://api.cirrus-ci.com/v1/task/6171895557521408/logs/ci.log",

During inbound connection creation, `TestNode::add_p2p_connection()` calls `P2PConnection::peer_connect()` where an object of `EncryptedP2PState` class is created - this object `v2_state` contains the function `EncryptedP2PState::initiate_v2_handshake()` to send ellswift bytes\r\n2. then the asyncio code to create a connection happens and `connection_made()` is called when the connection is opened\r\n\t- inside `connection_made()`, 64 bytes ellswift is sent using `EncryptedP2PState::initiate_v2_handshake()`\r\n3. When the `TestNode` sends a response, `P2PConnection::data_received()` callback will detect it\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat happens in test:\r\n- there are 2 variables:\r\n1. `send_net_magic` - initially true. after we send magic bytes, `send_net_magic_bytes` is set to false (basically just a switch to send 64 bytes in 2 parts)\r\n2. `can_data_be_received` - initally false - data can't be received until mismatch from V1_PREFIX occurs. after we send remaining mismatched 60 bytes, `can_data_be_received` is set to true.\r\n- since response will be detected on `TestNode`, we add an assertion to make sure `send_net_magic` = false (meaning magic bytes already sent) and `can_data_be_received` = true (meaning mismatched 60 bytes also sent). `TestNode` wouldn't send a response in the intermediate states.\r\n- so the possible states are:\r\n1. initially\r\n\t`send_net_magic` = true, `can_data_be_received` = false (Assertion would fail in `data_received()` but shouldn't happen)\r\n2. after `connection_made()`'s `custom EncryptedP2PState::initiate_v2_handshake()` (TestNode <--4 bytes magic bytes-- P2PInterface)\r\n\t`send_net_magic` = false, `can_data_be_received` = false (Assertion would fail in `data_received()` but shouldn't happen)\r\n3. after `p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py` test when we call `custom EncryptedP2PState::initiate_v2_handshake()` explicitly (TestNode <--remaining 60 bytes-- P2PInterface)\r\n\t`send_net_magic` = false, `can_data_be_received` = true (Assertion passes in `data_received()`)",

          "body": "# Session details\r\n- Date: 07-12-2023\r\n- Time: IST 20:00 (UTC 14:30)\r\n- PR: [test/BIP324: functional tests for v2 P2P encryption bitcoin/bitcoin#24748](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24748)\r\n- Context: `p2p` `test`\r\n- Difficulty: intermediate\r\n- Language: python\r\n\r\n# Learning\r\nThis is the 2nd part for a 2-part review club. The review club will focus on how [PR #24748](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24748) modifies the functional test framework in order to make v2 transport protocol work for the python implementation of a node's peer.\r\n\r\n- Functional test framework\r\n- P2P network\r\n> Note: Drop your PR and review related suggestions/thoughts/questions below\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n-  Developers often want to be able to send their own custom response, introduce malicious behaviour and check if error messages were reported, pause and examine bitcoind process etc. The `P2PInterface` class serves this purpose and mocks the behaviour of a peer. It's written in python and can be easily customised.\r\n- bitcoind instance has support for encrypted transport protocol since [#28331](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28331). In order for the `P2PInterface` class to communicate with bitcoind instance using encrypted transport protocol, we need to add support for encrypted transport protocol in `P2PInterface` class. This means introducing:\r\n\t1. [Initial v2 handshake](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki#shared-secret-computation)\r\n\t\t- Currently nodes establish connection with the other node by sending a version message and waiting for a version message and a verack message back from the other node. It then sends a verack back to the peer to establish the connection. This is called a version handshake.\r\n\t\t- With encrypted transport protocol, we even want the version message to be encrypted. So before the version handshake, an advanced form of Diffie-Hellman handshake (called initial v2 handshake) happens so that both nodes have same keystream to encrypt/decrypt P2P messages.\r\n\t2. New P2P message format for encrypting/decrypting P2P messages\r\n\t    - v1 P2P message format\r\n![v1](https://github.com/Bitshala/BitcoinCore-PR-Review-Club/assets/44024636/65cb05a1-8148-4697-966e-ea988f41ef9f)\r\n\t    - v2 P2P message format\r\n![v2](https://github.com/Bitshala/BitcoinCore-PR-Review-Club/assets/44024636/100ce36c-9f98-439a-8b44-dfe02fdf27c1)\r\n\r\n# Questions\r\n1. Describe how the initial v2 handshake works.\r\n\t- see how [`v2_handshake()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9a6b684becbffd02f24a686b965ada257fa7bfd9/test/functional/test_framework/p2p.py#L235-L283) calls [`initiate_v2_handshake()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9a6b684becbffd02f24a686b965ada257fa7bfd9/test/functional/test_framework/v2_p2p.py#L110-L112), [`respond_v2_handshake()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9a6b684becbffd02f24a686b965ada257fa7bfd9/test/functional/test_framework/v2_p2p.py#L114-L127), [`complete_v2_handshake()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9a6b684becbffd02f24a686b965ada257fa7bfd9/test/functional/test_framework/v2_p2p.py#L129-L146), [`authenticate_v2_handshake()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9a6b684becbffd02f24a686b965ada257fa7bfd9/test/functional/test_framework/v2_p2p.py#L148-L184)\r\n\t- Why are there 4 different functions?\r\n2. How are inbound connections modified to support v2?\r\n\t- see where version msg get sent.\r\n\t- we need to call the v2 handshake functions before that.\r\n4. How are outbound connections modified to support v2?\r\n\t- see where version msg get sent.\r\n\t- we need to call the v2 handshake functions before that.\r\n5. Has the P2P message size reduced/increased in v2? Does order of sending P2P messages matter in v1/v2 P2P?\r\n6. Why does false advertisement of services which a node can support happen? What happens if we start doing initial v2 handshake with a node which doesn't support encrypted transport protocol? How is backward compatibility maintained?",

          "title": "RPC: add new `listmempooltransactions`",
          "body": "## Proposed Update\r\n\r\nAdd a new RPC endpoint, `listmempooltransactions`. Takes as args a `start_sequence` and `verbose`.\r\n\r\nReturns: \r\n- if verbose false, list of txids + their `entry_sequence` where each entry's `entry_sequence` >= the provided `start_sequence.\r\n- if verbose true, raw tx output info including each entry's `entry_sequence`.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilds on work done in #19572.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nThe current mempool RPCs are lacking an ability to scan for updates in a more efficient manner. You can subscribe for updates via the ZMQ pipeline, but even this is inefficient to recover from if your consumer app falls offline.\r\n\r\nZMQ also is a push protocol, and doesn't provide a rate-limiting mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn the case of core-lightning, we don't assume access to bitcoin-core/ZMQ, so we're unable to do efficient mempool querying. There have been some recent CVEs come to light where having optional access to mempool updates may prove useful.\r\n\r\nPaging, filtering by last seen, and the addition of full tx data in the call makes mempool data more readily available to any client app. This is good for self-sovereignty as it reduces the need for additional dependencies and app data sources to efficiently query and parse mempool data. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Things I Considered\r\nMy initial attempt at this modified `getrawmempool` to \r\n- take a `start_sequence` to allow for filtering, and\r\n- adding the txdata (inputs outpoints + outputs (amount + scriptPubKeys)). \r\n\r\nThat was pretty ugly however, given that the current data model for `getrawmempool` is around a concept of \"mempool entry\" data. This new RPC in contrast only returns transaction data (and does not report on information about other mempool dependencies etc; for that you should still call `getrawmempool` or `getmempoolentry`). \r\n\r\nYou could add a `start_sequence` to the existing `getrawmempool` to help with entry data paging/querying but that's secondary to my goals for fetching relevant txdata from the mempool.\r\n\r\n## Additions/Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR could be further improved by\r\n- Add a `page_size` argument which allows a calling application to limit the number of results returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\nThe current RPC only supports finding *added* mempool transactions. It'd be interesting to experiment with keeping track of evicted/not mined transactions and adding them to the results.\r\n\r\nThis would require:\r\n- An additional memory buffer (perhaps a configurable memory limited ring buffer?) for evicted tx data and the mempool sequence of the eviction.\r\n- Adding a `sequence_action` field for results, which indicates whether the sequence is for the tx's `addition` or `eviction`.\r\n\r\nYou could also keep track of tx movements into blocks, but this seems less useful/urgent in general.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nYou can see an example of this implemented and used in CLN for finding paid onchain invoices in this branch: https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/compare/master...niftynei:lightning:nifty/mempool-scan\r\n\r\nNote that the CLN implementation doesn't currently keep the mempool_sequence in disk, so it'll reload/rescan the mempool at start. This *may* be desirable?\r\n\r\nHere's how a caller would use this\r\n\r\n```\r\n1) start node\r\n2) listmempooltransactions 0 to get backlog\r\n3) call listmempooltransactions again with `start_sequence` set to `mempool_sequence` result from last call\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this works well with ZMQ as the `mempool_sequence` number is identical.",

To be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.\r\n\r\nSplit from #25907",

I added it next to the `net` column because I thought it looked nice there, but if people prefer it somewhere else I'm happy to move it.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-12-11 17-51-22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/48763452/b4f5dfcb-16be-4d8f-9303-9d342123deec)\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "#24748 added v2 transport to the python `P2PConnection`, but so far each test that wants to make use of it needs to enable it on an individual basis.\r\nThis PR changes it so that if the test suite is run with `--v2transport` option, v2 is used in each test by default, not only for connections between two bitcoind instances as before, but also wherever `P2PConnection` is used. Individual tests can override this global option.\r\n\r\nTo do that, a few tests need to be adjusted.\r\nIn addition, I added a commit to always use v1 in a few select subtests that send a large number of large messages (e.g. large reorgs). These tests don't have a fundamental problem with v2 but become very slow due to the unoptimised python ChaCha20 implementation (~30 minutes on my computer, so probably not suitable to be run in the CI).\r\n\r\nAs a result, `python3 test_runner.py --v2transport` should succeed and use `v2` everywhere (unless v1 is chosen explicitly).\r\n\r\n[Edit]: To make the \"test each commit\" CI pass, several test fixes were squashed into the last commit, which actually enables v2 p2p for `P2PConnection`. I have an unsquashed version at https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/202401_bip324_alltests_unsquashed, in case that helps with review.\r\n\r\n",

Disconnection happens when incorrect garbage terminator is sent\r\n3. Disconnection happens when garbage bytes are tampered with\r\n4. Disconnection happens when AAD of first encrypted packet after the garbage terminator is not filled\r\n5. bitcoind ignores non-empty version packet and no disconnection happens\r\n\r\nAll these tests require a modified v2 P2P class (different from `EncryptedP2PState` used in `v2_p2p.py`) to implement our custom handshake behaviour based on different scenarios and have been kept in a single test file (`test/functional/p2p_v2_misbehaving.py`). Shifted the test in `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py` which is of the same pattern to this file too.",

It doesn't wait for the other thread. This isn't a problem with v1 (if the messages are sent in different orders, nothing may break),  but with v2 I think the connection would break down because the ChaCha stream cipher is stateful.\r\n\r\nSo I think that maybe we need some kind of synchronization / locking mechanism?\r\n\r\nI haven't though much about a solution yet, just wanted to share this problem.",

I have a WIP branch at \r\nhttps://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/tmp_bip324_fixalltests for that which has helped me find this concurrency issue and other issues I mentioned above, but will only open a PR after this PR is merged.\r\n\r\n> Seems like the long run-time in case 4. is primarily caused by the slow ChaCha20 implementation in Python.\r\n\r\nI agree. I think that his particular subtest maybe could be skipped with v2 because its goal is to stress the node by bombarding it with lots of messages in a short time, not the test framework. But also,  `feature_block.py` and `feature_maxuploadtarget.py`, become very slow on my computer for the same reason and we might have to only run them with v1 transport.",

Looking at this again - even without the \"`if self.v2_state.peer`\", the code paths for when 64 + 16 + 20 bytes is received or when 64 bytes, delay, 16 + 20 bytes is received works fine!\r\n\r\nEDIT: the code path in `complete_handshake` returning 0, b\"\" to receive rest of (64-x) bytes doesn't work currently because it would result in an assertion failure here in case 64 bytes ellswift were received in smaller chunks. added an [else condition](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/e8d8124bade589ac489377118650f4085890b51d..a5e0d0b3abc70b7f8501743a0787880a32eb5b93) in case that happens.",

This potentially will call `v2_handshake` 16 times, and process byte arrays of length from 1..16.\r\n\r\nIn practice I don't think this matters, given the logic never triggers: this happens when the python node is the responder, and the Core node will never send a half-baked `magic_bytes + version` (it may partially happen randomly, but its rather unlikely).\r\n\r\nStill, it feels a small enough change in case this ends up being reused.\r\n",

My intuition would be that having a global lock should be slower, especially if multiple connections are run at the same time, given they would be racing to acquire that lock every time a message needs to be sent (?)\r\n\r\nw.r.t wether or not a deadlock is possible, I think @mzumsande may be able to tell you better given he was the one pointing them out initially, but if we want to enforce a certain ordering of acquiring them I think my suggestion (or something on those lines) may be worth adding.

See for example: `on_message` -> `p2p_lock` taken -> call `on_inv` -> call `send_message` -> `_send_lock` taken\r\n- What must be disallowed is that any thread can do the reverse: First take `_send_lock`, and then take `p2p_lock`, because it would lead to a deadlock\r\n- I don't think that this is possible because I looked at the one spot where `send_lock` is taken (it calls `self.build_message` and `self.send_raw_message`, neither of which take `p2p_lock`) \r\n- But it is perfectly allowed that Thread 1 take `_send_lock`, and immediately after Thread 2 takes `p2p_lock` (which would trigger the assert).",
