    "body": "This is a more involved version of #10697, which instead completely gets rid of our nasty AddRef() and Release() in favor of automatic lifetime management.\r\n\r\nSpecial care must be taken, though, to only delete CNodes from a single thread, and to control which thread that is. Eventually, this should move to the message processing thread, so that it's not possible to hit cs_main from the main network thread.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this safely, this PR introduces 2 new generic smart pointer types: strong_ptr and decay_ptr. They provide a functionality that I've wanted for a long time: the ability to safely decay a shared_ptr to a unique_ptr. That sounds somewhat nonsensical at first, but it's useful to be able to make copies of a pointer for a while, stop, wait until only one remains, then delete with guaranteed safety.\r\n\r\nPlease read shared_ptr.h and check out the tests before groaning. I think this is a very cool (and completely safe) pattern.\r\n\r\nThis functionality could potentially be accomplished with a shared_ptr and polling ptr.unique(), but that's inherently racy because a new copy could be created simultaneously. Even moving to a local instance and calling .unique() on that one is not safe, as a weak_ptr could be upgraded simultaneously.\r\n\r\nInstead, a strong_ptr is created which acts like a unique_ptr but allows shared_ptrs to be \"loaned\" out. Once a strong_ptr is moved into a decay_ptr, the strong_ptr is reset and no new loans may be created. The decay_ptr tracks the lifetime of the loaned copies, and knows whether or not they have all expired. This can be queried, with no race concerns, with decay_ptr::decay().\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if the loaned shared_ptrs for some reason outlive the strong_ptr/decay_ptr, they are safely deleted once the last loaned shared_ptr expires. So there is no risk of leaks.\r\n\r\nIn order to make review easier, these changes were made in a few stages:\r\n1. Where possible, make functions agnostic to the type of pointer being used\r\n2. Switch to shared_ptr but keep existing refcounting on top\r\n3. Switch to strong_ptr\r\n4. Drop existing refcounting and now-unnecessary locking.",

Create a strong_ptr like any typical smart pointer. It cannot be\n+            copied, but it can \"loan out\" shared_ptrs using\n+            strong_ptr::get_shared().\n+        2. Use the \"loaned\" shared_ptrs as usual, and use the strong_ptr as\n+            though it were a unique_ptr.\n+        3. When it's time to coalesce, move the strong_ptr into a decay_ptr.\n+        4. Query the status with decay_ptr::decayed().\n+\n+    Once moved into a decay_ptr, the original strong_ptr is reset, and the\n+    decay_ptr is unable to loan out any new shared_ptrs. Once the decay_ptr has\n+    decayed, it behaves just like a unique_ptr.\n+\n+    If a loaned shared_ptr outlives the strong_ptr that owns it, the lifetime\n+    is extended until the last copy is deleted. This is accomplished by\n+    creating a shared_ptr to represent the lifetime of the strong_ptr, and\n+    storing a copy of it in the loaned shared_ptr's deleter.\n+\n+    Thus, strong_ptr and decay_ptr ensure that allocated memory is always freed.\n+\n+    Here's a quick example of their use:\n+\n+        void func(std::shared_ptr<int>)\n+        {\n+            // Some long-lived operation\n+        }\n+\n+        int main()\n+        {\n+            strong_ptr<int> str(make_strong<int>(100));\n+            std::thread(func, str.get_shared());\n+            decay_ptr<int> dec(std::move(strong));\n+            // The original strong_ptr is now reset\n+            while (!dec.decayed()) {\n+                // wait here\n+                continue;\n+            }\n+            // dec is guaranteed to be unique here. Its memory will be freed\n+            // when it goes out of scope.\n+            return 0;\n+        }\n+*/\n+\n+template <typename T>\n+class decay_ptr;\n+\n+template <typename T>\n+class strong_ptr\n+{\n+    struct shared_deleter {\n+        void operator()(T* /* unused */) const {}\n+        const std::shared_ptr<void> m_data;\n+    };\n+\n+    friend class decay_ptr<T>;\n+\n+    template <typename U, typename...
