It looks like Ubuntu is the exception to me.\r\n\r\nI'm _not_ a Linux expert, but based on the research I just did it looks like `/usr/lib/systemd/system` is still the default path for most other distributions (making Debian/Ubuntu the exception). \r\n\r\nI was trying to keep my change as minimal as possible but I agree that assuming latest and adding notes to the more outdated or non-default options would be clearer. Would it be preferred to change the first comment to this:\r\n\r\n`NOTE: When installing for systemd in Debian/Ubuntu the .service file needs to be copied to the /lib/systemd/system directory instead.`\r\n\r\nAnd to add a second comment in the Upstart section mentioning that it is no longer the default? Like this:\r\n\r\n`Upstart was the default init system for Debian/Ubuntu versions older than 15.04. If you are using version 15.04 or newer and haven't manually configured upstart you should follow the systemd instructions instead.`\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Debian/Ubuntu mentioned in the header for Upstart, I tried those steps first myself before getting stuck.",

But it can cause other headaches. \r\nSee this link: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User#How_it_works",
