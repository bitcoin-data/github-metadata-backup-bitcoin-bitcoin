This particular failure is a new test added by me in #11001, but I haven't seen it fail in this way before. It appears that the node doesn't receive a version message that the test framework sends to it, possibly because we're trying to connect too soon after changing the mocktime. I'll see if adding a sleep to the test fixes that.\r\n\r\nI've restarted the job for you.",
