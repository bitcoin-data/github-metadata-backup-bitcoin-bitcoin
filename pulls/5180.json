      "body": "It's not a per-network policy, please, read the code. It's quite the opposite actually: it's decoupling policies from networks.\nPreviously the user can only select 4 {policy, network} pairs: {standard, mainnet}, {test, testnet}, {test, regtest}, {standard, unitest}\nWith 2 separate policy classes the available combinations are 8: {standard, test} x {mainnet, testnet, regtest, unitest}.\nIt also simplifies modifications.\n\nA pointer to an abstract class is by all means more flexible than a reference to a an extern object when it comes to support multiple policies.\nWith Policy::Factory() you can make as many of them as you want, as shown in the example.\nIf you want to avoid managing memory manually, Policy::Pool() can be used instead.\nOf course, its interface can be simplified to Policy::FactoryPool() (hiding CPolicyPool class).\nIf we're not going to have several policies with different states for the same policy type, Policy::Simple() is enough..\nYou can even hide CNodePolicy, exposing the abstract class is enough.\nIn fact, what is the point in exposing the abstract class if you're not going to use polymorphism? \n\nI will of course clean this up, but I hope this can convince you that CNodePolicy::fRequireStandardTx, exposing CNodePolicy and the extern CNodePolicy in main are mistakes.\n\n I'm indifferent to \"coins: GetTxFees method\" because I don't see it as specially useful, but if the new method is not even going to be used (as in \"SQUASHME: actually use GetTxFees method\") I would say NACK. It seems completely orthogonal to the rest of the PR anyway.\n",

They can define new policy options and make their help messages be accesible to the users without having to touch init.cpp, only modifying policy.cpp is enough for all this. The help messages can also be accessed (per available policy) as a vector of string pairs to make it easier to implement a GUI to configure those options (although I don't plan to do that myself).\nAs more parts of the policy code move to policy.cpp, this encapsulation gets more useful.\n\nTo start using it. The function script/standard.o::IsStandard() is turned into a method: ApproveScript().\nMany more policy-related improvements can be cleanly proposed after this first steps are merged.\n\nOUTDATED:\nThis is an attempt to get a first commit for moving policy-related code together as proposed in #4943.\nThe main purpose of this PR is therefore discuss the commit \"Policy: Create CPolicy interface and CStandardPolicy implemention\" (https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/572f12948285b14fcb2c2d1c9e2f51e749cc6cb6) which may change with suggestions.\nThe commit \"Policy: MOVEONLY: script/standard.o::IsStandard() -> CPolicy::ValidateScript()\" (https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/9e99ebafc38718ca54730e764091a82a248a1a3c) acts as an example for adding a method to CPolicy. \nThe commit \"Policy: Refactor: Move datacarrier policy logic to policy.o\" (https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/f141dd0b9b4059c2d54d0762d5dd0fe86976a18a) is an example of adding an attribute to CStandardPolicy without exposing it on CPolicy or exposing CStandardPolicy itself.\nAn example of a crazy custom policy that a user could implement for its local node can be found in https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/compare/policy_example\n\nThe commit \"Policy: Refactor: Move datacarrier policy logic to policy.o\" may be considered too risky and may be left for later to avoid delaying the first step. \nMaybe https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/a2954632879076d3b9763001aca21bf768797e54 is not welcomed. It is only necessary if you want to make InitPolicyFromArgs() and CPolicy::InitFromArgs() param mapArgs const and don't want to duplicate code.\n\nI am very sorry for letting the ut acks rot.\n",

The only disagreement is how you allow users to select `Params().RequireStandard()` independently of the chainparams selected (but we agree that should be possible,  @petertodd does too https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5521#issuecomment-67774957). That little disagreement is out of scope for this PR. The two potential solutions should be easier to review, maintain and discuss after this PR has been acked.\nI thought he also disagreed on:\n\n1) Only the interface can be accessed from outside policy.cpp, the implementation is hidden.\n2) policy.o shouldn't depend on main.h or contain any concurrency-related code.  \n\nHe doesn't disagree, he was just doing some things faster and left others for later in his version of policy encapsulation (https://github.com/luke-jr/bitcoin/tree/nodepolicy2). There's a version rebased on top of this PR that satisfies 1 but not 2 in https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/tree/luke_policy2 [I'm afraid I've also introduced an error in the last 3 commits].\nHe thought I also disagreed on:\n\n3) static variables contained in policy.o should become parameters of the reference policy implementation (CStandardPolicy).\n\nI don't: I was just leaving that for later.\n\nThis PR is mostly composed of code movements that I expect will be uncontroversial. 3 commits just move a single function and its associated globals if any. 2 of them are not purely moveonly because they change the function headers or move some functionality from one function to another, but are mostly code movements.\nFinally, the last commit creates a CPolicy interface (abstract class) and a CStandardPolicy implementation; and it's open for method name bikesheding.\n@luke-jr if you like this PR I'm closing #5595 and #5114.\n",

          "body": "Minimal changes to create a CPolicy interface and a CStandardPolicy implementation.\nNo policy globals are encapsulated as CStandardPolicy attributes yet.\nCPolicy is not made a parameter of main::AcceptToMemoryPool() yet.\nNo factory (to select another implementation other than CStandardPolicy) nor -policy=<string> runtime argument are created yet.\n\nOutdated:\n\nThis is a reopen of #5595. Even though I knew I had to reopen it before force-pushing to it, I forgot about it. I think I solved this problem once by pushing the old branch back, reopening and then pushing the new branch, but the first step doesn't seem to be working. I'm happy to close this and reopen #5595 if somebody gives me a solution.\n\nText from the other PR:\n\nFirst steps for encapsulating the policy code.\nAn interface (abstract class) CPolicy and a concrete implementation CStandardPolicy are created.\n\"Users\" (people capable of modify and build Bitcoin core) can implement alternative policies and select them with the option -policy=<policy_name>. They can define new policy options and make their help messages be accesible to the users without having to touch init.cpp, only modifying policy.cpp is enough for all this. The help messages can also be accessed (per available policy) as a vector of string pairs to make it easier to implement a GUI to configure those options (although I don't plan to do that myself).\nAs more parts of the policy code move to policy.cpp, this encapsulation gets more useful.\n\nTo start using it. The function script/standard.o::IsStandard() is turned into a method: ApproveScript().\nMany more policy-related improvements can be cleanly proposed after this first steps are merged.\n",
