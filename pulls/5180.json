      "body": "It's not a per-network policy, please, read the code. It's quite the opposite actually: it's decoupling policies from networks.\nPreviously the user can only select 4 {policy, network} pairs: {standard, mainnet}, {test, testnet}, {test, regtest}, {standard, unitest}\nWith 2 separate policy classes the available combinations are 8: {standard, test} x {mainnet, testnet, regtest, unitest}.\nIt also simplifies modifications.\n\nA pointer to an abstract class is by all means more flexible than a reference to a an extern object when it comes to support multiple policies.\nWith Policy::Factory() you can make as many of them as you want, as shown in the example.\nIf you want to avoid managing memory manually, Policy::Pool() can be used instead.\nOf course, its interface can be simplified to Policy::FactoryPool() (hiding CPolicyPool class).\nIf we're not going to have several policies with different states for the same policy type, Policy::Simple() is enough..\nYou can even hide CNodePolicy, exposing the abstract class is enough.\nIn fact, what is the point in exposing the abstract class if you're not going to use polymorphism? \n\nI will of course clean this up, but I hope this can convince you that CNodePolicy::fRequireStandardTx, exposing CNodePolicy and the extern CNodePolicy in main are mistakes.\n\n I'm indifferent to \"coins: GetTxFees method\" because I don't see it as specially useful, but if the new method is not even going to be used (as in \"SQUASHME: actually use GetTxFees method\") I would say NACK. It seems completely orthogonal to the rest of the PR anyway.\n",
