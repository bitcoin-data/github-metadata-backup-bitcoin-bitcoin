Fixing entire bug classes of course! :)\r\n\r\nAdd option `--valgrind` to run the functional tests under Valgrind.\r\n\r\nRegular functional testing under Valgrind would have caught many of the uninitialized reads we've seen historically.\r\n\r\nLet's kill this bug class once and for all: let's never use an uninitialized value ever again. Or at least not one that would be triggered by running the functional tests! :)\r\n\r\nMy hope is that this addition will make it super-easy to run the functional tests under Valgrind and thus increase the probability of people making use of it :)\r\n\r\nHopefully `test/functional/test_runner.py --valgrind` will become a natural part of the pre-release QA process.\r\n\r\n**Usage:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ test/functional/test_runner.py --help\r\n…\r\n  --valgrind            run nodes under the valgrind memory error detector:\r\n                        expect at least a ~10x slowdown, valgrind 3.14 or\r\n                        later required\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Live demo:**\r\n\r\nFirst, let's re-introduce a memory bug by reverting the recent P2P uninitialized read bug fix from PR #17624 (\"net: Fix an uninitialized read in ProcessMessage(…, \"tx\", …) when receiving a transaction we already have\").\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/consensus/validation.h b/src/consensus/validation.h\r\nindex 3401eb64c..940adea33 100644\r\n--- a/src/consensus/validation.h\r\n+++ b/src/consensus/validation.h\r\n@@ -114,7 +114,7 @@ inline ValidationState::~ValidationState() {};\r\n\r\n class TxValidationState : public ValidationState {\r\n private:\r\n-    TxValidationResult m_result = TxValidationResult::TX_RESULT_UNSET;\r\n+    TxValidationResult m_result;\r\n public:\r\n     bool Invalid(TxValidationResult result,\r\n                  const std::string &reject_reason=\"\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, let's test as normal without Valgrind:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ test/functional/p2p_segwit.py -l INFO\r\n2019-11-28T09:30:42.810000Z TestFramework (INFO): Initializing test directory /tmp/bitcoin_func_test__fc8q3qo\r\n…\r\n2019-11-28T09:31:57.187000Z TestFramework (INFO): Subtest: test_non_standard_witness_blinding (Segwit active = True)\r\n…\r\n2019-11-28T09:32:08.265000Z TestFramework (INFO): Tests successful\r\n```\r\n\r\nThird, let's test with `--valgrind` and see if the test fail (as we expect) when the unitialized value is used:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ test/functional/p2p_segwit.py -l INFO --valgrind\r\n2019-11-28T09:32:33.018000Z TestFramework (INFO): Initializing test directory /tmp/bitcoin_func_test_gtjecx2l\r\n…\r\n2019-11-28T09:40:36.702000Z TestFramework (INFO): Subtest: test_non_standard_witness_blinding (Segwit active = True)\r\n2019-11-28T09:40:37.813000Z TestFramework (ERROR): Assertion failed\r\nConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused\r\n```",
