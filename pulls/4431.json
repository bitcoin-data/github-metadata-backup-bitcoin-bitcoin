    "body": "This has taken me several days to code and test, and I've tested it thoroughly.\n\nWith the current code, that uses only one syncnode, with these changes, the node will never download orphan blocks. With net debugging enabled, you will get a good view of what it's doing.\n\nIt also downloads the blockchain very fast, and never allows more than 60 seconds (the default) of inactivity to occur, so recovers very quickly from stuck downloads. With my testing, this can safely be reduced to 10 seconds as if a downloads sticks for as long as 10 seconds, it never recovers, so rather than wait two minutes as the current code does (well, tries to do), it quickly switches to a new syncnode.\n\nPlease do test, and give comments. So far, with the orphan problem, many people are unable to run the node without limiting orphan blocks (which still doesn't fix the stuck download anyway).\n\nFeel free to copy this branch and improve it. I've included quite a few commits to make it easier to see the development process, but I won't always have time to make the changes needed that people ask for, and from experience my pull requests often don't get pulled for some reason. I think this functionality is needed now based upon the issues people have been raising.\n",

A peer can easily cause bitcoind to waste time processing TXs, fill and max out the orphan tx database dropping random txs from the orphan tx database, wasting bandwidth, etc. A potential DoS target.\n\nThere is no requirement that a client must send an `inv`, wait for a `getdata`, than send a `tx`.  Currently, bitcoind will accept unrequested txs.\n\nI am proposing bitcoind not accepted unrequested txs, forcing peers to send an `inv` first and respond to `getdata` requests.\n\nI'd like to hear thoughts from others.\n",

When one peer stalls the movement of the window, it is disconnected.\n- No more orphan blocks. At all. We only ever request a block for which we have verified the headers, and store it to disk immediately. This means that a disk-fill attack would require PoW.\n- Some new fields in getpeerinfo:\n  - 'syncheight': the height up to which we've validated this peer's headers.\n  - 'commonheight': the height up to which we have all blocks in common with this peer.\n  - 'inflight': the heights we're currently requesting from this peer.\n- Require protocol version 31800 for every peer (released in december 2010).\n- No more syncnode (we sync from everyone we can, though limited to 1 during initial _headers_ sync).\n- Introduce some extra named constants and comments.\n- Reindexing support for out-of-order blocks on disk.\n",

It has no currently known problems and is suitable for testing, and I have several nodes running on it without issue.\n\nWhen I looked at this patch previously it was performing a number of risky behaviors like disconnecting peers on low arbitrary timeouts. A partial adjustment that introduces new vulnerabilities and doesn't address the larger performance problems is not a good use of review or testing resources. We certantly wouldn't be rushing something like that out the door, so the claim of urgency is not helpful here.\n",

      "body": "@gmaxwell The default timeouts were address as soon as they were mentioned, and changed to 2 minutes as requested. I still mantain, however, that 2 minutes is far riskier than my suggested 10 seconds, as at a 2 minute timeout this can significantly cause atypical nodes to delay block propagation by them issuing the latest block inv as quickly as possible (before they've even got the headers), and then ignoring the getdata block request. With my code, this is mitigated significantly, and it's highly unlikely and unusual for a node to not start sending a block within 10 seconds of it being requested - this is based on over two years of testing. On what are you basing your argument?\n",

      "body": "I though previously explained in this in adequate detail in your prior pull request that disconnected well behaving nodes: This kind approach makes the network fragile in a multitude of situations, including hosts on even slightly slow links. Effectively a two minute timeout increases the minimum bandwidth that can keep a node running bitcoin by more than 5 fold. This of behavior means that moderate or short lived DOS attacks (or just high utilization) can cause disconnection potentially allowing an attacker to partition the network.\n\nYes— malicious nodes attacking the network can potentially slow down receiving blocks (and thats still true with your change). This is part of why the standard advice (and widespread practice) for mining nodes is to not expose them to the public network directly. Increasing partition risk, or reducing the ability to run slow or overloaded links at all isn't a good trade-off.\n\nI'd really encourage you to spend time testing headers first.\n",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.\n",

          "body": "I've recently started resyncing (from about April this year) and getting 1.8. Twice now I've run into a problem where it seems to get stuck in the debug.log at processing new blocks.\n\nProcessBlock: ORPHAN BLOCK 751, prev=hash\nProcessBlock: ORPHAN BLOCK 751, prev=new hash\nProcessBlock: ORPHAN BLOCK 751, prev=another hash\nProcessBlock: ORPHAN BLOCK 751, prev=etc\n\nWhen this happens. I close Dogecoin-QT and open it up again and starts syncing properly again.\n\nI suspect it is because the max orphan blocks in memory was set to 750.\n\nAs far as I understand the point is to keep orphans in memory until the parents have been found/synced and attaching them. Over time, this gets larger and larger until it potentially reaches the hardcoded max (750).\n\nWhen max orphans get reached, it starts deleting a random orphan and adding the new orphan into memory... potentially dropping an orphan that would've linked up the chain. Thus slowing down the chain sync considerably as it has to wait again for the correct combo of orphaned blocks to be in memory for the chain to link up?\n\nI see Bitcoin is experiencing this as well: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4353\n\nThere seems to be temporary fix but which shifts it to another problem. See discussion here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4431\n",
