This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Original change description\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with assumeutxo, here's a brief summary from [the issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15605) (where any conceptual discussion not specific to this implementation should happen):\r\n\r\n> assumeutxo would be a way to initialize a node using a headers chain and a serialized version of the UTXO state which was generated from another node at some block height. A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n> \r\n> This would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly (and with less disk usage) than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip. Needless to say this is at expense of accepting a different trust model, though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nIn short, this is an interesting change because it would allow nodes to get up and running within minutes given a ~3GB file (at time of writing) under an almost identical trust model to assumevalid.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I add a few RPC commands: `dumptxoutset` creates a UTXO snapshot and writes it to disk, and `loadtxoutset` intakes a snapshot from disk, constructs and activates chainstate based on it, and continues a from-scratch initial block download in the background for the sole purpose of validating the snapshot. Once the snapshot is validated, we throw away the chainstate used for background validation.\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo procedure as implemented is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A UTXO snapshot is loaded with the `loadtxoutset <path>` RPC command.\r\n1. A new chainstate (`CChainState`) is initialized using `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`:\r\n   1. The serialized UTXO data is read in and various sanity checks are performed, e.g. compare expected coin count, recompute the hash and compare it with assumeutxo hash in source code.\r\n   1. We \"fast forward\" `new_chainstate->m_chain` to have a tip at the base of the snapshot (with or without block data). Lacking block data, we fake the `nTx` counts of the constituent `CBlockIndex` entries.\r\n   1. `LoadChainTip()` is called on the new snapshot and it is installed as our active chainstate.\r\n1. The new assumed-valid chainstate is now our active, and so that enters IBD until it is synced to the network's tip. Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n1. Once the active chainstate is out of IBD, our old validation chain continues IBD \"in the background\" while the active chainstate services requests from most of the system.\r\n1. Once the background validation chainstate reaches a height equal the base of the snapshot, we take the hash of its UTXO set and ensure it equals the expected hash based on the snapshot. If the hashes are equivalent, we delete the validation chainstate and move on without event; if they aren't, we log loudly and fall back to the validation chainstate (we should probably just shut down).\r\n\r\nThe implicit assumption is that the background validation chain will always be a subset of the assumed-valid snapshot chain while the latter is active. We don't properly handle reorgs that go deeper than the base of the snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Changes (already merged/outdated)\r\n\r\n![chainstate-beforeafter (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/54435797-a16b0780-4707-11e9-89c3-c90b5686804d.png)\r\n \r\nThe crux of this change is in removing any assumptions in the codebase that there is a single chainstate, i.e. any references to global variables `chainActive`, `pcoinsTip`, et al. need to be replaced with functions that return the relevant chainstate data at that moment in time. This change also takes `CChainState` to its logical conclusion by making it more self-contained - any references to globals like `chainActive` are removed with class-local references (`m_chain`).\r\n\r\nA few minor notes on the implementation:\r\n\r\n- When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\n- For additional notes, see [the new assumeutxo docs](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/blob/utxo-dumpload-compressed/doc/assumeutxo.md).",

      "body": "> Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, the snapshot can't be terribly recent for the user of it or it breaks the security model. Assume valid only has any security at all if there is time for the review and communication about review to happen, which means a human timescale of at least weeks.\r\n\r\nProbably the assumption should be that snapshots are created pretty close to tip, just far enough to avoid wasting time in reorgs (even 6 blocks would be fine) but the users aren't using them until they are quite a bit older, likely using the second to most recent available one.\r\n\r\n> We don't serve blocks or transactions to the network while we're operating with an unvalidated snapshot-based chain.\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't do that.  The worst that getting it wrong does is getting us disconnected from peers, which isn't particularly cosmic (and at least we might notice that something is going wrong).  The downside of it is that not forwarding transactions shoots our privacy in the head, since any transaction we're emitting would be one we created.\r\n\r\n> When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\nSounds good.\r\n\r\n>  compare it with the claimed hash in the snapshot metadata.\r\n\r\nThis is a zero security approach.  You can't just ask the user for a value and then accept that. The attack is to reorg the chain and then announce to everyone that there is a node bug and you need to run this command to continue, we specifically engineered out that possibility in assumevalid.  This isn't hypothetical, this is exactly what we've seen happen in ethereum w/ fastsync.\r\n\r\nThis is a fine setup for testing your PR however!    Ultimately we should get it to a state where a (FEC-split) copy of the state is loaded from the network and where it can be tested against a publicly reviewed constants configured in the software and/or blockchain.",

I know you are putting off really breaking this up and restructuring it, but maybe you could start by just splitting b2a735d00d3c297cdfdd93609c12537497025ca1 in two commits: one that adds the new classes and function arguments and brute force renames without changing behavior, and a smaller one with the new functionality. That way reviewers could see the more interesting changes without having to go through all the mind-numbing renames.",

I spent the last few days reconstructing the changeset into sensible commits - hopefully it's easier to understand this way.\r\n\r\nMost of the early commits are just shuffling stuff around (though all of it strictly necessary AFAICT). I've phrased the changes as much as possible as scripted-diffs and move-onlys. In replaying the changes, I found a few unnecessary diffs to omit.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has additional suggestions for how this could be made easier to review, I'm all ears, though I'm not holding my breath waiting until some Concept (N)ACKs roll in on #15605.

          "body": "Resolves #786\r\n\r\nTo be able to restore wallet transactions, before syncing\r\nthe node must be configured appropriately:\r\n1. node must import the private key\r\n2. node must generate addresses up to(including) the last one that was used.\r\n3. (Alternatively), we can pre-generate few K addresses (as the rescan does)\r\n\r\nPre-generating addresses are required as since the snapshot\r\ndoesn't contain the full blockchain history, node can't recover all its addresses.\r\n\r\nAfter the sync, we have two limitations:\r\n1. since the snapshot doesn't contain inputs, txs that\r\nend up in the wallet, won't have inputs too. It shouldn't\r\naffect the wallet but will require us to tune the GUI\r\nand properly visualize it. Alternatively, we can request\r\nfull transaction from the peers on demand.\r\n2. `CMerkleTx` has a field `nIndex` which contains the position\r\nof the transaction in the block. We also don't have this field\r\nand it's set to 0. \r\n\r\nCreated an issue to tackle the above limitations https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/issues/896 \r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Kostiantyn Stepaniuk <kostia@thirdhash.com>",

When combined with #13713 it should be easier to create and test the snapshot (I had some difficulty wrapping my head around the demo script). That also means `loadtxoutset` can refuse to process a snapshot for a lower block height than the most recent fully processed block (even if the header is a valid-fork).\r\n\r\nTo facilitate writing functional tests, you could allow a `-assumeutxo` param for regtest only.",

I'm not getting any warnings during compilation when using clang 9.0.0 and gcc 7.3.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.2.\r\n\r\n> I don't think an RPC method is the right tool for loading a snapshot (it's fine for saving); probably better to just specify a location at launch.\r\n\r\nLoading snapshot only on startup would simplify things in the short run, but ultimately if we're going to share snapshots over the P2P network, we'll need to support loading them at runtime. Better to test that process out earlier IMO.\r\n\r\n> I waited for it to fetch a few blocks and tried again, but same error...\r\n\r\nOops, looks like I introduced a bug during a recent rebase. Fixing now. Thanks for testing!\r\n\r\n> Can you add an actual assumeutxo value (mainnet & testnet)?\r\n\r\nYep, I'll do this in the next day or so.\r\n\r\n> To facilitate writing functional tests, you could allow a -assumeutxo param for regtest only.\r\n\r\nYep, this seems like a good idea. I'm also going to try to do as much unittesting as I can (as opposed to functional tests).",

It also distinguishes `CChainState`'s `CChain` data member as `m_chain` instead of the current `chainActive`, which makes it easily confused with the global data.\r\n\r\nThe active chain must be obtained via function because its reference will be swapped at some point during runtime after loading a UTXO snapshot.\r\n\r\nThis change, though lengthy, should be pretty easy to review since most of it is contained within a scripted-diff. Once merged, the parent PR should be easier to review.",

      "body": "@Sjors thanks very much for testing.\r\n\r\n> it crashed when I stopped the node and started it again\r\n\r\nYou found a bug in how the init process interacts with an assumed-valid chainstate. I needed to add `nChainTx` reconstruction to `LoadBlockIndex()` and make some allowances for the assumed-valid chain in `RewindBlockIndex()`. The details of the fix are mostly contained in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/7d10a00daca80c6a8e68196ae7c016c1123d91fe, but we also now write `BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS` into the appropriate CBlockIndex entries during snapshot activation (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/7bfbb78b445efbefa5238b4d23290ad4d4db05cf#diff-24efdb00bfbe56b140fb006b562cc70bR5001).\r\n\r\n> Consider pausing IBD while loading the file.\r\n\r\nOn your advice I'm now acquiring `cs_main` during snapshot activation for clarity when testing, but I think that closer to merge we should undo this. The snapshot chainstate can populate on a separate thread while traditional IBD starts and I don't think either slows the other down since they're running on separate threads and writing to separate data structures (the block index excluded).\r\n\r\nNote that you can isolate most of the snapshot-related logs with `tail -f debug.log | grep '[snapshot]'`.\r\n\r\n> Once we reach the tip and it starts syncing from genesis in the background, the log is too quiet.\r\n\r\nI've added a `[background validation] UpdateTip: ...` message for every 2000 blocks synced in the background.\r\n\r\n> How do plan to handle block pruning?\r\n\r\nSince we don't expect (or support handling) reorgs in the background validation chainstate, we prune it aggressively (within 1 block of tip; see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/e37372a0236b12dff422eaeca643db7d64f58b48#diff-24efdb00bfbe56b140fb006b562cc70bR3635). Given current pruning precision, this seems like a rounding error and so I think should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThanks again for testing. The most recent version of this PR is rebased and should be usable.",

I think we should keep this in for at least one release, because it's easier than the `grep` approach. It could also make sense to wait ~60 seconds after the snapshot is loaded before resuming the original IBD. That way the log looks like:\r\n* IBD...\r\n* rpc call to load snapshot (if RPC debug is enabled)\r\n* pauze IBD\r\n* loading snapshot\r\n* snapshot loaded, begin sync from snapshot\r\n* little bit of sync from snapshot\r\n* IBD resumed\r\n* interwoven log entries from both syncs\r\n\r\n> we prune it aggressively (within 1 block of tip)\r\n\r\nPruning normally flushes `dbcache` though, are you preventing that?\r\n\r\n> Maybe a `background:` key that contains a nested version of the same information?\r\n\r\nThat seems better (or `snapshot`), since otherwise you have to call `monitorsnapshot` to even find out anything is happening.",

Parameterizing these functions by a particular CChainState is necessary for the use of multiple chainstates simultaneously (e.g. for asynchronous background validation).\r\n\r\nIn this change, we\r\n- make the CChainState interface public - since other units will start to invoke its methods directly,\r\n- introduce `::ChainstateActive()`, the CChainState equivalent for `::ChainActive()`,\r\n- and move `IsInitialBlockDownload()` and `FlushStateToDisk()` into methods on CChainState.\r\n\r\nIndependent of assumeutxo, these changes better encapsulate chainstate behavior and allow easier use from a testing context.\r\n\r\nThere are more methods that we'll move in the future, but they require other substantial changes (i.e. moving ownership of the `CCoinsView*` hierarchy into CChainState) so we'll save them for future PRs.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nThe first move-only commit is most easily reviewed with `git diff ... --color-moved=dimmed_zebra`. \r\n",

      "body": "Did another test (on Ubuntu) and was able to create a snapshot and load it in a fresh datadir.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to make a snapshot while still in IBD, the chain reorged down to the specified height and then immedidately shot up again to the tip, before making a (presumable wrong) snapshot. Easiest solution is for the demo script to check if `initialblockdownload` is `false`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps related, but I managed to corrupt the node that I took the snapshot from:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-05-08T17:35:39Z Checking all blk files are present...\r\n2019-05-08T17:35:40Z Initializing chainstate Chainstate [ibd] @ height -1 (null)\r\nbitcoind: validation.cpp:2448: void CChainState::PruneBlockIndexCandidates(): Assertion `!setBlockIndexCandidates.empty()' failed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI recovered with `-reindex` and then made the snapshot more carefully.\r\n\r\nWhen I restart the node during the snapshot sync, I notice that `monitorsnapshot` returns the wrong values for verification_progress of `snapshot` (e.g. `0.142`) which doesn't go up much until you restart again (`initialblockdownload: false`). I restarted a few times, and then it suddenly showed 0.9999 again.\r\n\r\nThe new logging every 2000 blocks feature doesn't work after restart.\r\n\r\nThe snapshot successfully validated, but when I try to shutdown gracefully it doesn't get beyond the \"dumped mempool\" message. Probably a thread locking issue; no crazy CPU or memory usage. I had to use `kill -9`, but fortunately it still worked at the next start.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried pruning yet.",

Currently, each CChainState instance has its own mapBlockIndex, a collection of linked block headers, in addition to a few other data structures that are related to maintenance of the block tree but not necessarily to any given chainstate.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid duplicating this data across chainstates, this change moves chainstate-agnostic block metadata (and related behavior) into a class, `BlockManager`. Chainstates are parameterized with a reference to a blockmanager instance and in practice they share the same instance.\r\n\r\nMost of this change is conceptually move-only, though the diff is somewhat muddled. The first commit can be reviewed slightly more easily with `--color-moved=dimmed_zebra`. Admittedly, that commit is pretty unwieldy; I tried to split it up after the fact with `git add --patch`, but that was difficult because of git's inability to split hunks past a certain point. Some of the moves also ended up being obscured when done over separate commits.",

The user can't change it in the intro screen, but can change it later. I'm tempted to increase that default to 10 GB, and then have the intro screen reduce it if space is really tight.\r\n\r\nTips for testing:\r\n* move your existing data dir elsewhere\r\n* wipe data dir at every restart (behavior is different if it exists)\r\n* launch with `bitcoin-qt -resetguisettings -lang=en` (there's some space issues in different languages)\r\n* fake your free space by changing `intro.cpp` line 90: `freeBytesAvailable = 5000000000; // 5 GB`\r\n* try both testnet and mainnet, because settings are seperate. In particular note how step 7 in `GuiMain` switches where `QTSettings settings` points to; this had me thoroughly confused on testnet, because I was setting them too early.",

UTXO snapshot\r\nactivation is one such case, as we populate `cacheCoins` with the snapshot\r\ncontents and want to persist immediately afterwards but also enter IBD.\r\n\r\nSee also #15265, which makes the case that under normal operation a\r\nflush-without-erase doesn't necessarily add much benefit. I open this PR\r\neven in light of the previous discussion because (i) flush-without-erase\r\nalmost certainly provides benefit in the case of snapshot activation (especially\r\non spinning disk hardware) and (ii) this diff is fairly small and gives us convenient \r\noptions for more granular cache management without changing existing policy. \r\n\r\nSee also #15218.

      "body": "A few quick updates on this branch.\r\n\r\n### New snapshots\r\n\r\nI've added an allowed assumeutxo hash at height 600,000 (which you can check with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh - ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=[...]`) and have uploaded snapshot files ([Google Drive](https://storage.googleapis.com/assumeutxo/utxo.600k.dat), [Google Cloud](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sGNpAsdQPPZNpWt7Wwbi5u3bHZiIKmSb/view?usp=sharing)) for testers' convenience. We obviously don't necessarily need to preserve this value for merge, but I figure it's useful for testing and not unrealistic.\r\n\r\nYou can test this branch easily by running a script like\r\n```sh\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nset -e\r\nif [ ! -f ./src/bitcoind ]; then\r\n  echo \"Must be in built bitcoin directory.\"\r\n  exit 1\r\nfi\r\nSNAPSHOT_LOC=/tmp/utxo.600k.dat\r\nDATADIR=/tmp/bitcoin-assumeutxo-test\r\nmkdir -p $DATADIR\r\n\r\n[ -f ${SNAPSHOT_LOC} ] || curl -L https://storage.googleapis.com/assumeutxo/utxo.600k.dat > $SNAPSHOT_LOC\r\n/usr/bin/time -v ./src/bitcoind -datadir=$DATADIR -dbcache=4000 -stopatheight=604401 &\r\nsleep 60\r\n# Might timeout.\r\n/usr/bin/time -v ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATADIR loadtxoutset $SNAPSHOT_LOC || true\r\nfg %1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter running this you should end up with a node that's synced to tip within 60-90 minutes depending on your internet connection and hardware.\r\n\r\n### Benchmarking\r\n\r\nI've compared reindexing to height 550,000 for this branch vs. its base ([a la previous PRs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16801#issuecomment-551883348)), and beyond some outlier runs on both sides, this changeset seems to be comparable in performance to master.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhost         tag                      time       time% maxmem  cpu%  dbcache\r\nbench-ssd-2  bench/au.1               9:24:53    0.92  6717.99MB 338%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-2  bench/au.1               9:23:14    0.92  6770.57MB 339%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-2  bench/au.master.1        10:08:33   0.99  6654.39MB 315%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-2  bench/au.master.1        10:13:04   1.00  6697.26MB 313%  5000MB\r\n\r\nbench-ssd-3  bench/au.master.1        9:26:17    0.93  6743.38MB 337%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-3  bench/au.master.1        9:24:03    0.93  6748.67MB 338%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-3  bench/au.1               9:22:35    0.92  6713.50MB 340%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-3  bench/au.1               10:08:36   1.00  6712.88MB 314%  5000MB\r\n\r\nbench-ssd-4  bench/au.1               9:24:59    0.93  6744.43MB 338%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-4  bench/au.1               10:06:09   1.00  6717.30MB 315%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-4  bench/au.master.1        9:23:44    0.93  6695.61MB 339%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-4  bench/au.master.1        9:23:56    0.93  6646.16MB 338%  5000MB\r\n\r\nbench-ssd-5  bench/au.master.1        9:18:57    1.00  6715.23MB 341%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-5  bench/au.master.1        9:20:35    1.00  6644.22MB 341%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-5  bench/au.1               9:17:27    0.99  6702.63MB 342%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-5  bench/au.1               9:21:17    1.00  6663.15MB 340%  5000MB\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote of course that as a sort of \"meta\"-optimization, these benchmarks are solely to ensure that we haven't introduced any performance regressions into normal operation. The really relevant benchmark here is \"time from empty datadir to usable node,\" which on one of my more capable machines has gone from ~20hrs to ~1hr. \r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\n\r\nIf you want to help move this project forward, the following PRs are prerequisites and once they're merged I'll carve off the next changeset:\r\n\r\n- #16945 \r\n- #17487 \r\n\r\n### Current work\r\n\r\nAfter significantly revising the structure of the snapshot file in #16899, this branch has been substantially rebased to avoid the requirement of any on-disk snapshot metadata once the snapshot has been loaded; instead we look to filesystem state (the presence of a `$DATADIR/chainstate_*` folder) to signal that we are currently building a snapshot chainstate. Once this chainstate has been fully back validated, we move it over to the regular `chainstate/` dir on shutdown. We also used to need on-disk state to restore the \"faked\" `nChainTx` data for snapshot-based header chains -- we now cache that information in the snapshot's chainstate itself (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/87093a94ba311c495a1982f4f47d0c4607789f8f).\r\n\r\nI'm currently thinking about how to handle locking semantics (as you might be able to tell from the last commit, which needs to be squashed into the rest of the history at some point) which I can detail further if anyone's interested.",

Until we allow chainstate creation from UTXO snapshots (next assumeutxo PR?) it's basically unnecessary, but it is a prerequisite for background IBD support.\r\n\r\nChanges are also made to the initialization process to make use of `g_chainman` and thus clear the way for multiple chainstates being loaded on startup.\r\n\r\nOne immediate benefit of this change is that we no longer have the `g_blockman` global, but instead have the ChainstateManager inject a reference of its shared BlockManager into any chainstate it creates.\r\n\r\nAnother immediate benefit is that uses of `ChainActive()` and `ChainstateActive()` are now covered by lock annotations. Because use of `g_chainman` is annotated to require cs_main, these two functions subsequently follow.\r\n\r\nBecause of whitespace changes, this diff looks bigger than it is. E.g., 4813167d98 is most easily reviewed with\r\n```sh\r\ngit show --color-moved=dimmed_zebra -w 4813167d98\r\n```",

          "body": "If the database (especially the UTXO set - the block index is pretty fast to rebuild, but could be included) corrupts this can result in multi-hour service interruptions while reindexing from scratch. I know this shouldn't happen, but in practice it does seem to happen for some (potentially unknown) reasons, on some hardware. One scenario where it can happen uncontrollably is power loss (e.g. #7233).\n\nIt would help if there was an option to periodically make database snapshots. Then when there is a corruption issue, the software can - either manually or automatically - revert to the latest snapshot and catch up from there.\n\nThis could be done in a background thread using the UTXO set cursor introduced in #7756 (here a basic [linearize-utxo](https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin/tree/2016_05_utxo_linarize) utility). Most notably there is, with leveldb, no need to \"stop the world\" while the backup is in progress.\n\nAn utxo state dump is about 1.2Gb as of block 408202:\n\n```\n-rw-rw-r--  1 1243427106 May 10 13:36 utxo.dat\n```\n\nIt is not very compressible (well, xz does a reasonable job):\n\n```\n-rw-rw-r--  1 1243427106 May 10 13:36 utxo.dat\n-rw-rw-r--  1 1199339866 May 10 13:41 utxo.dat.gz\n-rw-rw-r--  1  764742324 May 10 13:55 utxo.dat.xz\n```\n\nSo this should be optional for users that would trade a few GB of disk space for increased reliability.\n",

We can also move DumpAddresses there: it can't be time-analyzed, but can possibly take long (if I/O is slow and a lot of entries), and is fine with waiting an extra minute. I believe it can also be relevant for the utxo snapshot creation from [assumeutxo](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606) project?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we expand the existing single scheduler with a functionality which allows to set an upper bound on the runtime of tasks it executes, and/or switch between tasks (I don't know how yet, but that should be doable).\r\n\r\nI'm interested in your opinions!",

Currently, this RPC is scanning the full UTXO set every time it is called which makes it hard to use for users that [want to continually check the coin supply](https://blog.bitmex.com/forkmonitor-unexpected-inflation-detection-and-warning-system/) or compare UTXO set hashes between different nodes. It is especially challenging in periods of multiple quickly mined blocks, even relatively fast machines.\r\n\r\nImplementation overview:\r\n- The current serialization of the UTXO set for the purpose of hashing is changed based on sipa's concept in proposed on the [mailing list in 2017](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014337.html) and #10434\r\n- The hashing algorithm in for the UTXO set is changed to Muhash, which was also implemented by sipa\r\n- CoinStatsIndex is added which keeps an index of all values that would require `gettxoutsetinfo` to scan the UTXO set\r\n- CoinStatsIndex can be activated through the flag `-coinstatsindex`\r\n\r\nTodos/Open questions:\r\n- The transactions count is currently not implemented as it seems not knowable ex-post without running a full IBD to build up the index. I am looking for a solution to this. Ideas are:\r\n  - Require `txindex` and the transactions count from it\r\n  - Remove transactions count or mark it as unreliable in a different way if coinstatsindex is enabled\r\n- The transactions count question is also interesting because it seems to be the only obstacle to providing access to historical coin statistics, which may be a nice follow-up feature if transaction counts can be ignored somehow\r\n- More benchmarking to evaluate potential switch from Muhash to [ECMH](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/477) as the hashing algorithm\r\n- IBD benchmarking with the index enabled\r\n- Tests could be improved\r\n\r\nThis is an extension to my [rolling UTXO set hash proposal](https://gist.github.com/fjahr/fa4892874b090d3a4f4fccc5bafa0210) from last year.\r\n\r\nEdit: 3c5c1ca should probably be squashed into the prior commits but I wanted to leave sipa's commits unchanged for the start.",

          "body": "Fixes #17890. Replaces #17892.\r\n\r\nData files (`{blk|rev}<number>.dat`) pre-allocate space as they are written, and then trims down to the final size once they move on to the next sequence (\"finalized flush\"). The code currently assumes (incorrectly) that blk and rev files finish at the same time, but because blk files are written as blocks come in, and rev files are written in block height order, rev files end up being written to for awhile after moving on to the next block file, resulting in pre-allocation and waste of up to 1 MB of space per rev file.\r\n\r\nThe exact point at which rev file writing finishes is the highest height block found inside the corresponding block file, which is already available in the CBlockFileInfo vector. This PR moves finalized flushing of undo files to to directly after the undo data for the previous block file has been written.\r\n\r\nThere is a branch with annotation that demonstrates how this is handling flushing here: https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin/tree/200124-rev-files-annotated",

See\r\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-February/016697.html\r\nfor full details.\r\n\r\nThe current guard against marking `CheckBlock()` failed blocks as invalid\r\nis by calling `CheckBlock()` prior to `AcceptBlock()` in `ProcessNewBlock()`.\r\nThat is brittle since `AcceptBlock()` has an implicit assumption that any\r\nblock submitted has been checked for mutation. A future change to\r\n`ProcessNewBlock()` could overlook that implicit assumption and introduce\r\na consensus failure.\r\n\r\nMove the mutation guard logic into `AcceptBlock()` and\r\nadd comments to explain why we never mark `CheckBlock()` failed blocks as\r\ninvalid.\r\n",

This means that we have to reclaim some of the cache that we've allocated to the original chainstate (per `dbcache=`) to repurpose for the snapshot chainstate.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it makes sense to have different cache allocations depending on which chainstate is more active. While the snapshot chainstate is working to get to the network tip (and the background validation chainstate is idle), it makes sense that the snapshot chainstate should have the majority of cache allocation. And contrariwise once the snapshot has reached network tip, most of the cache should be given to the background validation chainstate.\r\n\r\nThis set of changes (detailed in the commit messages) allows us to dynamically resize the various coins caches. None of the functionality introduced here is used at the moment, but will be in the next AU PR (which introduces `ActivateSnapshot`).\r\n\r\n`ChainstateManager::MaybeRebalanceCaches()` defines the (somewhat normative) cache allocations between the snapshot and background validation chainstates. I'd be interested in feedback if anyone has thoughts on the proportions I've set there.",

          "body": "Net processing now passes a `BlockValidationState` object into `ProcessNewBlock()`. If `CheckBlock()` or `AcceptBlock()` fails, then PNB returns to net processing without calling the (asynchronous) `BlockChecked` Validation Interface method. net processing can use the invalid `BlockValidationState` returned to punish peers.\r\n\r\n`CheckBlock()` and `AcceptBlock()` represent the DoS checks on a block (ie PoW and malleability). Net processing wants to know about those failed checks immediately and shouldn't have to wait on a callback. Other validation interface clients don't care about net processing submitting bogus malleated blocks to validation, so they don't need to be notified of `BlockChecked`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if PNB returns a valid `BlockValidationState`, we never need to try to process (non-malleated) copies of the block from other peers. That makes it much easier to move the best chain activation logic to a background thread in future work.",

This was new behavior since 6a72f26968cf931c985d8d4797b6264274cabd06 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16426 and is not ideal because it stops other wallets and rpcs and the gui from receiving new notifications until after the scan completes.\r\n\r\nThis change is a half-step towards implementing multiwallet scans (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11756), since it provides needed locator and birthday timestamp information to the Chain interface, and it rationalizes locking and event ordering in the startup code. The second half of implementing parallel rescans requires moving the ScanForWalletTransactions implementation (which this PR does not touch) from the wallet to the node.",

This does **not** change the current default behavior of `dumptxoutset`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks to the future `assumeutxo` feature (#15605), we now have a `dumptxoutset` RPC (#16899) which can write the whole UTXO set to disk. However, the current format, although compact, is not easily readable by standard tools (e.g. for someone who would like to study the UTXO set). Plus this binary format might change in the future AFAIK.\r\n\r\nProviding power users an easy way to have a human-readable dump of the UTXOs would be a useful feature. We would this way replace [3rd party hackish tools](https://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-utxo-dump) [with possible side effects](https://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-utxo-dump/issues/12).\r\n\r\nOn my machine (slow SSD):\r\n* dumping the whole original 4GB binary UTXO set takes around 1mn40\r\n* dumping the set in whole ASCII form takes less than 9GB and 3mn30 (ofc file size/time depends on which ASCII data you write to disk; you can select them via the `format` argument).\r\n\r\nThanks!",

      "body": "Quick update. I've rebased this PR in such a way that it does not rely on changes in #17487 to avoid being blocked on that going through. If that does merge, it'll be easy to update this branch to make use of the flush-without-erase behavior.\r\n\r\nThis needs testing (which I plan to do soon) as it's been a while since I've gone through the whole battery of manual system tests (i.e. actually loading snapshots and syncing). I need to focus on writing a few more functional and unit tests that will obviate most of that manual work. Some intermediate commits here almost certainly have compilation errors.\r\n\r\nThis project is getting to the point where it's less straightforward to find discrete bits of this draft to carve off for individual merge. Among the next changes are the snapshot activation procedure, the related RPC command for loading a snapshot, and all the little correspondent changes that have to happen in modules like net_processing to have snapshot chainstates actually function. I guess it makes sense to PR the snapshot activation changes (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/eae9c625b10a7b5e6495ebef8698a98873f4933a) individually, but after that it may be somewhat less straightforward to carve off commits. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering how averse people would be to treating much of the remainder of this draft as a single PR, and subsequently finishing off the first phase of assumeutxo in two or so more PRs?",

          "body": "We currently have two structures for per-peer data:\r\n\r\n- `CNode` in net, which should just contain connection layer data (eg socket, send/recv buffers, etc), but currently also contains some application layer data (eg tx/block inventory).\r\n- `CNodeState` in net processing, which contains p2p application layer data, but requires cs_main to be locked for access.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a third struct `Peer`, which is for p2p application layer data, and doesn't require cs_main. Eventually all application layer data from `CNode` should be moved to `Peer`, and any data that doesn't strictly require cs_main should be moved from `CNodeState` to `Peer` (probably all of `CNodeState` eventually).\r\n\r\n`Peer` objects are stored as shared pointers in a net processing global map `g_peer_map`, which is protected by `g_peer_mutex`. To use a `Peer` object, `g_peer_mutex` is locked, a copy of the shared pointer is taken, and the lock is released. Individual members of `Peer` are protected by different mutexes that guard related data. The lifetime of the `Peer` object is managed by the shared_ptr refcount.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `Peer` object and moves the misbehaving data from `CNodeState` to `Peer`. This allows us to immediately remove 15 `LOCK(cs_main)` instances.\r\n\r\nFor more motivation see #19398",

This is global state, which, in general, equals evil. It must be static, given that it's declared here, since its state must persist across calls to this function (very often, a block and its parent are in different `blk` files). We could eliminate this global state by allocating this map in the caller of this function, `src/init.cpp: ThreadImport()`, and passing it by reference to `LoadExternalBlockFile()`.\r\n> \r\n> Another thing that seems missing from the current design is, what happens if there are leftover entries in this map after reindexing has completed? That means we've read blocks from disk but never found their parent blocks. In my testing, this map is empty at the end of reindexing, as expected. But what if it wasn't? That would mean we're missing one or more `blocks/blk00nnn.dat` files, or some blocks from those files. Isn't that worth at least a `LogPrintf()`? Making this change would also require moving the map out to the caller, because this function doesn't know if it will be called again.",

As the first type it added `hash_type=none` which skips the hashing of the UTXO set altogether. This alone did not make `gettxoutsetinfo` much faster but it allows the use of an index for the remaining coin statistics even before a new hashing algorithm has been added. Credit to Sjors for the idea to take this intermediate step.\r\n\r\nFeatures summary:\r\n- Users can start their node with the option `-coinstatsindex` which syncs the index in the background\r\n- After the index is synced the user can  use `gettxoutsetinfo` with `hash_type=none` or `hash_type=muhash` and will get the response instantly out of the index\r\n- The user can specify a height or block hash when calling `gettxoutsetinfo` to see coin statistics at a specific block height",

(Included in this PR)\r\n* Ensuring pruning doesn't go too far for a desired-functional wallet backup. (Questionable, since you probably lose the node if you need the backup anyway?)\r\n* Allowing users to temporarily disable block indexes and filters, without pruning cutting them off from catching up later.\r\n* Avoiding pruning out from under external wallets (Armory, EPS, etc) that might need block data.\r\n* External block indexes/filters, etc.\r\n\r\nBy design, users retain complete control over prune locks, and can delete them out from under applications using them. This is to avoid circumstances where a prune lock has been set, by an application that may no longer be used.\r\n",

It also moves moves versionbitscache into deploymentstatus to avoid a circular dependency with validation.",

For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter.

          "body": "Currently we use an `unordered_map<uint256, CBlockIndex*>` for our BlockMap. This is a bit of a peculiar choice because we then store a pointer to the uint256 from the pair inside of the CBlockIndex. It would be conceptually simpler if we used a `unordered_map<CBlockIndex>` and modified `CBlockIndex` to directly own the uint256 for the phashBlock.\r\n\r\nThat's what this patch attempts doing. The only additional complexity is where we do want to query the map by key, the key equivalence stuff is only in C++20, so we add a helper that lets us construct a mock element easily for using with find.\r\n\r\nThe result is nicer since we get rid of an additional indirection for accessing the phashblock and we get rid of a lot of std::pair de-structuring. We also save a bit of memory per index (I haven't computed it precisely, but my guess is we save something like 24 bytes total per index by eliminating 1 pointer, which saves 8 bytes, and then could save us something like 16 bytes of padding). We also no longer can be in an inconsistent state where phashblock does not point to the entries own hash (although modifying phashblock once it is inserted into the map would be invalid -- it must be removed, modified, and reinserted).\r\n\r\nFuture work can likely further improve on this by making CBlockIndex owned* by the unordered_set directly, which will eliminate even more indirection/pointer chasing and make a lot of the code using BlockMap simpler (I don't think we ever rely on CBlockIndex being non-owned anywhere, nor should we have reason to in the future).\r\n\r\n\r\n* see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_set, it will still be safe to use pointers for e.g., pprev.\r\n```\r\n     References and pointers to data stored in the container are only invalidated by erasing that element, even when the corresponding iterator is invalidated. \r\n```",

For example arguments that have never been registered, but are still used, will always return the fallback value.\r\n* Tests may run several sub-tests, which need different settings. So globals will have to be overwritten, but that is fragile on its own: e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19704#issuecomment-678259092 or #19511\r\n\r\nThe goal is to remove gArgs, but as a first step in that direction this pull will change gArgs in init to use a passed-in reference instead.\r\n\r\n",

There are a few moveonyish/refactoring commits to allow for halfway decent unittests.\r\n\r\nBasic structure is included for specifying and checking the assumeutxo hash values used to validate activated snapshots. Initially I had specified a few height/hash pairs for mainnet in this change, but because of the security-critical nature of those parameters, I figured it was better to leave their inclusion to a future PR that includes only that change - my intent being that reviewers will be more likely to verify those parameters firsthand in a dedicated PR.\r\n\r\nAside from that and the snapshot activation logic, there are a few related changes:\r\n\r\n- ~~allow caching the `nChainTx` value in the CCoinsViewDB; this is set during snapshot activation. Because we don't necessarily have access to the full chain at the time of snapshot load, this value is communicated through the snapshot metadata and must be cached within the chainstate to survive restarts.~~\r\n- break out `CreateUTXOSnapshot()` from dumptxoutset. This is essentially a move-only change to allow the reuse of snapshot creation logic from within unittests.\r\n- ...and a few other misc. changes that are solely related to unittests.\r\n\r\nThe move-onlyish commit is most easily reviewed with `--color-moved=zebra`.",

Includes a new unittest verifying `g_best_block` behavior (previously untested at the unit level) and various changes necessary for running and testing `ProcessNewBlock()`-like behavior on the background validation chainstate.\r\n\r\nThis changeset introduces a new block index `nStatus` flag called `BLOCK_ASSUMED_VALID`, and it is applied to block index entries that are beneath the UTXO snapshot base block upon snapshot load. Once each block is validated (during async background validation), the flag is removed. This allows us to avoid (ab)using `BLOCK_VALID_*` flags for snapshot chain block entries, and preserves the original meaning of those flags.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR previously incorporated changes to `LoadBlockIndex()` and `RewindBlockIndex()` as noted in Russ' comments below, but once I generated the changes necessary to test the UpdateTip change, I decided to split this changes out into another PR due to the size of this one.",

I could also imagine a different approach thats splits out the tweaky commits as small obvious 1-commit PRs that could be reviewed in parallel, but this might just be more work and not solve anything.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world it would be nice if individual changes here could be accompanied by unit tests confirming the new behaviors, but understandable that this isn't happening since validation code is not very modular.",

I have opened #21766 which keeps track of potential improvements where the flaws already existed before the de-globalization work, please post on that issue about these improvements, thanks!\r\n\r\nNote to reviewers:\r\n1. This bundle may _apparently_ introduce usage of `g_chainman` or `::Chain(state|)Active()` globals, but these are resolved later on in the overall PR. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n2. There may be seemingly obvious local references to `ChainstateManager` or other validation objects which are not being used in callers of the current function in question, this is done intentionally to **_keep each commit centered around one function/method_** to ease review and to make the overall change systematic. We don't assume anything about our callers. Rest assured that once we are considering that particular caller in later commits, we will use the obvious local references. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n3. When changing a function/method that has many callers (e.g. `LookupBlockIndex` with 55 callers), it is sometimes easier (and less error-prone) to use a scripted-diff. When doing so, there will be 3 commits in sequence so that every commit compiles like so:\r\n\t1. Add `new_function`, make `old_function` a wrapper of `new_function`, divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the local module only**\r\n\t2. Scripted-diff to divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the rest of the codebase**\r\n\t3. Remove `old_function`",

          "body": "# Motivation\r\nThe main motivation of this change and only behavior change noticeable by user is to allow running `coinstatsindex` on pruned nodes as has been requested [here for example](https://twitter.com/benthecarman/status/1388170854140452870?s=20).\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n`coinstatsindex` on pruned nodes can be enabled in a much simpler than it is done here but it comes with downside. The ability to run `blockfilterindex`on pruned nodes was added in #15946 but it also added the `blockfilterindex` as a dependency to `validation` and it introduced two new circular dependencies. Enabling `coinstatsindex` on pruned nodes in a similar way would add it as a dependency as well and introduce another circular dependency. \r\n\r\nInstead, this PR introduces a `m_prune_blockers` map to `BlockManager` as a flexible approach to block pruning. Entities like `blockfilterindex`, for example, can add a key and a height to block pruning over that height. These entities need to update that value to allow more pruning when they are ready.\r\n\r\n# Alternative approach\r\nUpon completing the first draft of this PR I found #19463 as an alternative that follows the same but follows a very different approach. I am listing the main differences here as I see them:\r\n- Usage of globals\r\n- Blocks pruning with a start and a stop height\r\n- Can persist blockers across restarts\r\n- Blockers can be set/unset via RPCs\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't think any of these are necessary to be added here but if the general approach or specific features are more appealing to reviewers I am happy to change to a solution based on that PR or port over specific parts of it here.",

          "title": "log: Mitigate disk filling attacks by rate limiting LogPrintf",
          "body": "This picks up #19995 in an attempt to solve #21559.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to mitigate disk filling attacks by temporarily rate limiting `LogPrintf(…)`.\r\n\r\nA disk fill attack is an attack where an untrusted party (such as a peer) is able to cheaply make your node log to disk excessively. The excessive logging may fill your disk and thus make your node crash either cleanly (best case: if disk fill rate is relatively slow) or uncleanly (worst case: if disk fill rate is relatively fast).\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nThe hourly logging quota is set **per source location**. Every single source location (say net_processing.cpp:418) gets a quota of 1 MB of logging per hour. Logging is only dropped from source locations that exceed the quota.\r\n\r\n- Only logging to disk is rate limited. Logging to console is not rate limited.\r\n- Only `LogPrintf(…)` is rate limited. `LogPrint(category, …)` (`-debug`) is not rate limited.\r\n- `UpdateTip: new best=[…]` is logged using `LogPrintfWithoutRateLimiting(…)` to avoid rate limiting. High log volume is expected for that source location during IBD.\r\n- When logging is restarted a tally of how many messages/bytes were dropped is printed.\r\n- Log rate limiting can be disabled with the `-ratelimitlogging` config option.\r\n- All logs will be prefixed with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently being suppressed.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nIn a recent [PR Review Club meeting](https://bitcoincore.reviews/21603) we discussed this PR and evaluated alternative approaches.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Global rate limiting </summary>\r\n\r\n#### Global rate limiting\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion around an alternative approach which would be to globally rate limit `LogPrintf(…)`.  This approach was implemented in a competing PR #21706. The main point [1] in favor of global rate limiting is that it could be confusing to have incomplete logs when logs from one source location are dropped but not from others. The main point against global rate limiting is that it opens another attack vector where an attacker could trigger rate limiting and then execute a 2. attack which would then not be document in the logs at all. With regard to the attack vector on the global approach and the overall reviews the two approaches have gotten I have chosen to continue with the approach in this PR. \r\n(To address the concern of [1] i have chosen to prefix all logs with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently being suppressed.)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>logrotate</summary>\r\n\r\n#### logrotate\r\n\r\nLarryRuane brought up [logrotate](https://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate) which can be used on linux to monitor log files and perform actions (delete, compress, send somewhere, etc.) on them when a certain size or point in time is reached. `logrotate` could be used to rate limit log but since we would like log rate limiting to be enabled by default it is not the best solution. Also on windows an alternative would have to be used.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI have a written a unit test which is contained in this PR. (Not the greatest test, it currently does not work on windows thanks to `\\r\\n`. If someone has an idea how to improve the test i would appreciate it)\r\n\r\nFurther more I made a RPC [here](https://github.com/dergoegge/bitcoin/commit/8e6d15d6be06834d1f634f4a54ea646be8bc3491) that can log excessive amounts of \"a\"s from different locations which i have found useful during my own testing.\r\n`bitcoin-cli excessivelog <location (1-5)> <num_bytes>`\r\n\r\n⚠️One thing to note with that rpc is that the rate limiting logic still prints the last message that triggered the limiting to disk, so something like `bitcoin-cli excessivelog 1 536870912` would still log ~512MiB to disk. Logging to console is also never suppressed (unless -printtoconsole=0)  ⚠️\r\n\r\nA simple example to use the rpc:\r\n```bash\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest setmocktime 1\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 1048500 # log just under 1MiB\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 100 # this should get the total amount logged above 1MiB\r\n                                        # and the rate limiting logic should kick in\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest setmocktime 3602 # let 1 hour pass (only works in regtest)\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 100 # this should trigger logging to resume\r\n```\r\n",

          "title": "[p2p] Introduce node rebroadcast module ",
          "body": "## Status\r\n(this section will be updated as the PR progresses, and eventually removed)\r\n- I'm reworking some of the approach, will mark ready for review once that is done. \r\n\r\n## Motivation:\r\nOur legacy rebroadcast mechanism lives in the wallet code. It rebroadcasts only & all transactions which are “mine”, not discerning if the fee rate indicates the transaction should actually have been confirmed by now. This is bad for privacy because it leaks information that allows spy nodes to link bitcoin addresses with IP addresses, a relationship we aim to obfuscate. \r\n\r\n## PR Overview:\r\nThis PR introduces a rebroadcast mechanism in the node. Instead of only rebroadcasting our own transactions, we will notify the network about _any_ transactions we identified as missing from blocks based on fee rate expectations in our own mempool. \r\n\r\nThe new module is currently behind a configuration flag that defaults to off.\r\n\r\nThe end goal is to enable node rebroadcast by default, and remove wallet rebroadcast. This would improve privacy for a few main reasons: \r\n1. We would no longer eagerly rebroadcast all of our wallet transactions regardless of fee-rate. We add logic to rebroadcast the ones which have a competitive rate according to the current blocks being mined. \r\n2. If a spy observes a bitcoin core node rebroadcasting a transaction, it would no longer know that the node has wallet enabled. \r\n3. If a spy observed a bitcoin core node rebroadcasting a transaction, it would no longer be able to deduce with high confidence that the associated wallet is participating in that transaction.\r\n\r\n## Approach: \r\nConceptually, we want to rebroadcast transactions that we believe “should” have been mined by now.  Since we expect miners to prioritize transactions with the highest package fee rates, we select high fee rate transactions that have been in our mempool for some time, but have not yet been mined. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a `txrebroadcast` module that encapsulates the selection logic. When `PeerManager` gets notified that we have received and processed a block, we trigger the rebroadcast logic. The module calculates the highest fee rate mempool packages that meet some additional conditions- the transaction must be > 30 minutes old, and surpass a fee threshold. This threshold is calculated by periodically (every minute) identifying the top block of transactions in our mempool, and caching the fee rate for a package to be included. We eliminate any of these candidates that we have rebroadcasted recently (last 4 hours), or already rebroadcast more than a maximum amount of times (6). We store any remaining candidates on each peer’s `setInventoryTxToSend`, which they will potentially relay next time we hit `SendMessages` for that peer (subject to general transaction relay conditions). \r\n",

      "body": "Thanks for testing @Sjors. I couldn't reproduce your bug, but during manual testing I did find a number of issues based upon changes that have happened since last rebase. Subsequently I've pushed a bunch of new commits, some of which need to be fixed up. I've also done a manual test of the assumeutxo workflow and everything seems to be working properly again. \r\n\r\nI also found an issue, possibly new but possibly not, related to restarting bitcoind while using a snapshot that has not yet been fully validated. Basically, faked `nTx` values were not persisting and so `LoadBlockIndex()` was failing due to not constructing `setBlockIndexCandidates` as expected. \r\n\r\nIn response to the this as well as the recent changes in `RewindBlockIndex`, I've decided to make a change consistent with a previous recommendation from @ryanofsky: instead of mutating \"fake\" data into the block index for assumed-valid blocks, I'm instead explicitly accounting for the possibility of snapshot use at usage sites (e.g. `LoadBlockIndex()`, `NeedsRedownload()`). I think this is easier to reason about instead of relying on some implicit data faking.\r\n\r\n### Manual testing\r\n\r\nI've generated a snapshot at 685000 using the `utxo_snapshot.sh` contrib script.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsrc/bitcoin (? utxo-dumpload-compressed 4dfd3a2) % /usr/bin/time ./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh 685000 utxo-685.dat ./src/bitcoin-cli\r\nRewinding chain back to height 685000 (by invalidating 00000000000000000002091619d7ae1596349afb10fe8cb1833a09945db1180d); this may take a while\r\nGenerating UTXO snapshot...\r\n{\r\n  \"coins_written\": 75696073,\r\n  \"base_hash\": \"000000000000000000043a68d9e09f48eeb485ac28bde0abb6e0b6cb6e726a21\",\r\n  \"base_height\": 685000,\r\n  \"path\": \"/home/james/.bitcoin/utxo-685.dat\",\r\n  \"assumeutxo\": \"a85dd26a5ca449d76bc7cb6103960a2894475f11acef57efb77d833ca84d0ed3\",\r\n  \"nchaintx\": 644907744\r\n}\r\nRestoring chain to original height; this may take a while\r\n0.01user 0.00system 14:13.84elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 4712maxresident)k\r\n2688inputs+0outputs (22major+1584minor)pagefaults 0swaps\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then create a new datadir (`~/.bitcoin/utxo-test`), start up, and immediately load the snapshot:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsrc/bitcoin (? utxo-dumpload-compressed 4dfd3a2) % /usr/bin/time ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=/home/james/.bitcoin/utxo-test loadtxoutset ~/.bitcoin/utxo-685.dat\r\n{\r\n  \"coins_loaded\": 75696073,\r\n  \"tip_hash\": \"000000000000000000043a68d9e09f48eeb485ac28bde0abb6e0b6cb6e726a21\",\r\n  \"base_height\": 685000,\r\n  \"path\": \"/home/james/.bitcoin/utxo-685.dat\"\r\n}\r\n0.00user 0.00system 12:49.51elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 4348maxresident)k\r\n3536inputs+0outputs (18major+233minor)pagefaults 0swaps\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter load, I verified that the snapshot chain successfully syncs to tip, caches rebalance accordingly, and background validation starts. I also verified that the snapshot tip is maintained without issue as new blocks come in.\r\n\r\n### Next\r\n\r\nFunctional tests will be added to this branch. I may also add a contrib script that makes \"demoing\" the assumeutxo workflow more straightforward.\r\n",

          "title": "[p2p] Reduce addr blackholes ",
          "body": "This PR builds on the test refactors extracted into #22306 (first 5 commits). \r\n\r\nThis PR aims to reduce addr blackholes. When we receive an `addr` message that contains 10 or less addresses, we forward them to 1-2 peers. This is the main technique we use for self advertisements, so sending to peers that wouldn't relay would effectively \"blackhole\" the trickle. Although we cannot prevent this in a malicious case, we can improve it for the normal, honest cases, and reduce the overall likelihood of occurrence. Two known cases where peers would not participate in addr relay are if they have connected to you as a block-relay-only connection, or if they are a light client. \r\n\r\nThis implementation defers initialization of `m_addr_known` until it is needed, then uses its presence to decide if the peer is participating in addr relay. For outbound (not block-relay-only) peers, we initialize the filter before sending the initial self announcement when processing their `version` message. For inbound peers, we initialize the filter if/when we get an addr related message (`ADDR`, `ADDRV2`, `GETADDR`). We do NOT initialize the filter based on a `SENDADDRV2` message. \r\n\r\nTo communicate about these changes beyond bitcoin core & to (try to) ensure that no other software would be disrupted, I have: \r\n- Posted to the [mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018784.html)\r\n- Researched other open source clients to confirm compatibility, opened issues in all the projects & documented in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528#issuecomment-809906430. Many have confirmed that this change would not be problematic.\r\n- Raised as topic during [bitcoin-core-dev meeting](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2021-03-25.html#l-954)\r\n- Raised as topic during [bitcoin p2p meeting](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2021-04-20.html#l-439)",

The script itself involves creating a snapshot, modifying the chainparams, and then watching the snapshot-based sync process followed by background validation. It's also a happy-path test of the changes here. I hope others find it useful, even if it just ends up being an ephemeral thing for testing that is never merged.",

      "body": "Thanks for the helpful commentary @ryanofsky and thanks for the testing @Sjors.\r\n\r\nI've pushed a cleanup rebase that addresses some of your comments, slims the commit count down to 30 (from 37), and reorders the commits to be closer to the order I anticipate they'll be merged in. I understand some explication is required on things like indexation and P2P processing, and I'll include that in the constituent PRs.\r\n\r\nThis branch is now close to something resembling mergeability, though of course that's not my expectation. I'm somewhat concerned with the pace of this project (although extenuating circumstances like taproot not to mention my own (in)ability to keep up with this work over the last year provide some explanation). \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm going to try a different tack here and open a bunch of smallish, independently mergeable PRs containing some of the commits here that shouldn't change any behavior until multi-chainstate use actually becomes possible (i.e. with the merge of the `loadtxoutset` PR which is intentionally towards the back of the queue).\r\n\r\nThanks again to everyone for their help and patience on this project. Some of the code here was written 2 years ago for the bare purpose of coming up with a proof of concept and has been dragged along through many rebases, so everyone's participation here helping to shape up and vet this code is very much appreciated on my end.",

In the\r\n       \"abort\" mode the invocation of an unexpected syscall results in\r\n       the entire process being killed immediately by the kernel without\r\n       executing the unexpected syscall.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe allowed syscalls are defined on a per thread basis.\r\n\r\nI've used this feature since summer 2020 and I find it to be a helpful testing/debugging addition which makes it much easier to reason about the actual capabilities required of each type of thread in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nQuick start guide:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./configure\r\n$ src/bitcoind -regtest -debug=util -sandbox=log-and-abort\r\n…\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Experimental syscall sandbox enabled (-sandbox=log-and-abort): bitcoind will terminate if an unexpected (not allowlisted) syscall is invoked.\r\n…\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"addcon\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"dnsseed\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"net\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"msghand\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"opencon\"\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z Syscall filter installed for thread \"init\"\r\n…\r\n# A simulated execve call to show the sandbox in action:\r\n2021-06-09T12:34:56Z ERROR: The syscall \"execve\" (syscall number 59) is not allowed by the syscall sandbox in thread \"msghand\".

Should it attempt any other system calls, the kernel will terminate the process with SIGKILL or SIGSYS. In this sense, it does not virtualize the system's resources but isolates the process from them entirely.\r\n>\r\n> […]\r\n> \r\n> seccomp-bpf is an extension to seccomp that allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy implemented using Berkeley Packet Filter rules. It is used by OpenSSH and vsftpd as well as the Google Chrome/Chromium web browsers on Chrome OS and Linux. (In this regard seccomp-bpf achieves similar functionality, but with more flexibility and higher performance, to the older systrace—which seems to be no longer supported for Linux.)",

      "body": "Going through the changes in this PR, they seem reasonable, but not as straightforward as they could be. IMO, with a modest reworking, the assumeutxo logic could be better encapsulated and implemented in ChainStateManager without adding as many special cases in validation and other code.\r\n\r\nThe change I'd suggest would be to drop all the ChainStateManager `m_*_chainstate` members and just have a plain list of chainstates: `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<CChainState>> m_chainstates`, and change each chainstate `CTxMemPool& m_mempool` reference member to a `CTxMemPool* m_mempool` pointer member which is non-null for the active chainstate, null for any other chainstates. Validation code would loop over chainstates and update the mempool when it's non-null, skip it when it's null, send a `BackgroundBlockConnected` notification if it's null or `BlockConnected` if non-null, etc.\r\n\r\nThis would also allow;\r\n  \r\n- Dropping a lot of assumeutxo jargon. I still get \"IBD chainstate\" \"Snapshot chainstate\" \"Active chainstate\" \"Background IBD chainstate\" \"Validated chainstate\" confused and have to think about what they mean each time I see them in context. The current distinctions between \"valid\" and \"validated\" (valid by assumption vs validated by downloading blocks in the background) also seem unnecessarily opaque. These definitions seem unneeded if the assumeutxo implementation is confined to `ChainStateManager` and the assumeutxo RPC methods, and the rest of the code can just loop over chainstates treating them the same and just skipping some work if `m_mempool` is null.\r\n\r\n- More straightforward approach to pruning. Instead of having to write special case pruning logic, this could be integrated with #21726, and each chainstate could just add to a list of prune blockers (ranges of blocks not allowed to be pruned) and pruning code would not need to be aware of assumeutxo states.\r\n\r\n- Keeping future code maintainable and having confidence in completeness of the change. Fact that assumeutxo implementation is not well encapsulated now makes it hard to be confident that the long list of assumeutxo special cases in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606#issuecomment-868553822 is actually complete, and that special cases added now won't break in the future if there are assumeutxo changes later",

      "body": "Russ, thanks for the thorough and thoughtful look here. Really appreciate your design guidance.\r\n\r\nOf course I have the predictable grumbles about the rework necessary and a slight dread at the prospect of introducing more prerequisite refactoring (given this project has been ongoing for two years already), but on design questions like this I'm inclined to side with you given (i) this code began as a minimum-viable demo prototype, and (ii) I've been staring at it for too damn long to be objective.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but one of the motivating factors behind your suggestion here is the notion that we may one day be facilitating `n` background chainstates instead of just 1, at which point some rework would be required to fix the abstractions for that case. Indeed the utreexo project that @kcalvinalvin @adiabat et al. have been working on may introduce such a usage.\r\n\r\nJust a few potshot responses before really gauging the level of effort required to make the changes you're talking about:\r\n\r\n> HasMempool vs IsActiveChain\r\n\r\nOne pushback I might have is that a lot of the \"inline\" logic that's scattered throughout parts of validation and net_processing won't actually by simplified by relatively surface-level transformations of `== ActiveChainstate()` -> `HasMempool()`. In some cases switching behavior on mempool presence might be even more confusing (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/b51d6d7a30bc6c9bd0a63549254156ae3aeb6d4a) since the mempool is basically unrelated to things like validationinterface callbacks. But maybe making that change for cases where the mempool is relevant might make sense and be pretty easy (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/70395ccedafd54fda2bc2e634e631935f5f1cec3).\r\n\r\nFundamentally a lot of the validation/net logic just needs to know whether it's dealing with the active chainstate or not; I don't see a way around that short of moving a maybe-inappropriate amount of domain-specific code into the ChainstateManager. \r\n\r\n> supporting `n` chainstates\r\n\r\nIf our goal is to facilitate `n` background chainstates instead of just 1 (although maybe your goal is purely to make the code easier to follow?), my inclination would be to say that we should wait until we're actually looking to implement `n` chainstates before spending a bunch of time on design changes.\r\n\r\nOn list-of-chainstates vs. `m_ibd_chainstate` and `m_snapshot_chainstate`, these are private members  of chainman and so swapping them out for a list (when necessary) should be pretty easily doable. But until we have actual use for a list, doing such a refactoring would kind of make awkward [things like cache rebalancing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7317e14a44c6efc545e6fb9bcedee7174e93a8fa/src/validation.cpp#L5055-L5083). I guess that could be rephrased in terms of more general math... but why introduce the generality before we need it?\r\n\r\n> instead of having to write special case pruning logic, this could be integrated with Improve Indices on pruned nodes via prune blockers #21726, and each chainstate could just add to a list of prune blockers\r\n\r\nCan we not do this under the current design? I don't see why the suggested design changes would enable or simplify this, but admittedly I haven't given that work a close look yet.\r\n\r\n> Keeping future code maintainable and having confidence in completeness of the change.\r\n\r\nI think the reality is that introducing the possibility of multiple chainstates is a huge overhaul to the system and there's no free lunch in terms of simplification. Unless we move a lot of domain-specific code into the chainman, we're not going to get around some degree of scatter. I think in either case, you're not going to be able to verify completeness without grepping for every `CChainState` usage and manually examining it; I don't think there's a way around this regardless of the design you choose.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGrumbles aside I will spend the next few days trying to implement your proposed changes in an alternate branch. If the diff is small enough and I get your sign-off on completeness, I'll replace HEAD here.",

My comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606#pullrequestreview-692965905 was trying to make sense of things for myself as much as it was trying to give suggestions for the PR. So definitely feel free to any skip extra implementation work unless you think it will actually improve things.\r\n\r\nBut just to clarify, supporting multiple background chainstates was not my motivation at all. (I did try to think of use cases for multiple chainstates but couldn't think of any that seemed very realistic.) My motivation was purely to make resulting code more understandable and maintainable. I think ideally assumeutxo phases would be encapsulated completely in the ChainstateManager class and not referenced in any other validation code, including ChainState methods. I think outside of ChainstateManager no other validation code that should have to know about the \"IBD chainstate\" \"Snapshot chainstate\" \"Active chainstate\" \"Background IBD chainstate\" or\"Validated chainstate\". The jargon still just blurs together for me. I think ideally validation code should just deal with chains and blocks based on their attributes, not based on assumeutxo stages or the global sync state. Things just seem less confusing and more reassuring that way (more reassuring because special cases are less special and because background chainstates don't have access to the mempool).",

I'll look at doing that in addition to your other recommendations.\r\n\r\nI've pushed a rebase ([`utxo-dumpload.81`](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/tree/utxo-dumpload.81)) that reintroduces https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/cf9366fa4ffb37fd07ef44f0e8495226dcd72aea which I thought I might be able to omit but apparently is required to avoid test failures in certain configurations. I'm going to dig into the particulars of the related error to reconfirm the necessity of the commit.",

      "body": "> In some cases switching behavior on mempool presence might be even more confusing (e.g. [b51d6d7](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b51d6d7a30bc6c9bd0a63549254156ae3aeb6d4a)) since the mempool is basically unrelated to things like validationinterface callbacks.\r\n\r\nThis is probably subjective, but I don't see it as being unrelated. If the chain is connected to the mempool it's active, and `BlockConnected` should be called instead of `BackgroundBlockConnected`, and rewinds and disconnects are possible instead of impossible, and other notifications should be sent too. \r\n\r\n> Fundamentally a lot of the validation/net logic just needs to know whether it's dealing with the active chainstate or not;\r\n\r\nThere could be `bool IsBackground() const { return m_mempool == nullptr; }` or  `bool IsActive() const { return m_mempool != nullptr; }` helpers maybe. I tend to not like vocabulary-introducing things like this, because then you have the mental overhead of putting cases into a taxonomy instead of just making all the code handle all the cases. But this is very subjective.\r\n\r\n> I don't see a way around that short of moving a maybe-inappropriate amount of domain-specific code into the ChainstateManager.\r\n\r\nI'm actually not sure what this would be referring to.\r\n\r\n> On list-of-chainstates vs. `m_ibd_chainstate` and `m_snapshot_chainstate`, these are private members of chainman and so swapping them out for a list (when necessary) should be pretty easily doable. But until we have actual use for a list, doing such a refactoring would kind of make awkward [things like cache rebalancing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7317e14a44c6efc545e6fb9bcedee7174e93a8fa/src/validation.cpp#L5055-L5083). I guess that could be rephrased in terms of more general math... but why introduce the generality before we need it?\r\n\r\nFunny, it seems to me more general, less hardcoded math would actually be simpler to understand. Take the cache, divide it up, maybe boost some chain's weighting (I forget already) by some factor based on it's attributes. No thinking about assumeutxo phases or terminology.\r\n\r\n> > instead of having to write special case pruning logic, this could be integrated with Improve Indices on pruned nodes via prune blockers #21726, and each chainstate could just add to a list of prune blockers\r\n> \r\n> Can we not do this under the current design? I don't see why the suggested design changes would enable or simplify this, but admittedly I haven't given that work a close look yet.\r\n\r\nYes this would be doable under current design. I just mentioned it because it would be optional under current design, but required under the suggested design (because pruning code wouldn't know about the types of chainstates, it would just have to treat them generically and ask what blocks they need to keep).\r\n\r\n> > Keeping future code maintainable and having confidence in completeness of the change.\r\n> \r\n> I think the reality is that introducing the possibility of multiple chainstates is a huge overhaul to the system and there's no free lunch in terms of simplification. Unless we move a lot of domain-specific code into the chainman, we're not going to get around some degree of scatter.\r\n\r\nI don't think I'm suggesting to move any large pieces of code, but yes I do think ChainstateManager would be a little more complex because it would be more responsible for setting up and updating attributes of the chains so other validation code doesn't have to know about assumeutxo. I think this is just how things go with encapsulation. You don't necessarily reduce complexity, but you try locate it in one place.\r\n\r\nAgain though everything here is a suggestion and you will have a much better idea of this stuff than me. I'll take a look at the new branch, and I'm happy to review anything.",

I think I saw a minor todo comment or two in net processing code, but otherwise it seems like there is not very much uncertain or left to be resolved here, unless I'm missing something.\r\n\r\nIt could also be good to update the PR description, and because it seems like it is referencing changes that have already been made in prior PRs. You could just mention the PR numbers and say the text describes the combined changes.\r\n",

The need for this manual reset (AFAICT) arises out of the fact that many of these globals are closely related to the block index (hence `::UnloadBlockIndex`), and need to be reset with it.\r\n\r\nI've shot this \"manual reset\" gun at my foot several times while doing the de-globalize chainman work.\r\n\r\nThankfully, now that we have a `BlockManager` class that owns the block index, these globals should be moved under that class so that they can live and die with the block index. These moves, along with making the block index non-heap-based, eliminates:\r\n1. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3585b521392c5b2c855c3ba6dc9b7d2a171b3710 The need to reason about when we need to manually call `::UnloadBlockIndex` (this decision can at times seem almost arbitrary)\r\n2. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f741623c25455c20bff9eb1ddd10a4ac84dc5655 The need to have an `::UnloadBlockIndex` or explicit `~ChainstateManager` at all",

      "body": "As always, thanks for testing @Sjors. We've discussed on IRC, but just so others can follow along: what's happened here is you've listed the blockhash in your chainparams (`0x00000000000000000003f5acb5ec81df7c98c16bc8d89bdaadd4e8965729c018`) instead of the UTXO set hash (`0x2f47dc1e089b623a4bea57e0752b776df9e6885904d7ff8b14911b94c2208ff4`), and so consequently snapshot activation fails. You might have mistaken regular IBD for a snapshot sync-to-tip.\r\n\r\nHowever in doing this, you've uncovered a minor bug: if a snapshot fails to validate, it doesn't activate but it does leave its datadir in place. On next startup, init would try to load this snapshot chainstate on the basis of the datadir existence but, because it was never actually activated, blockindex assertions don't allow the load to happen. This error would have only occurred in practice if a user is given a malformed snapshot file or is manually tweaking chainparams values, as we are here.\r\n\r\nI've pushed a commit ensuring that teardown of the snapshot datadir happens should activation fail. An alternative to this would be setting some kind of block index state that controls snapshot load on startup, but I don't think that's necessary. \r\n\r\nThe correct chainparams modification for the snapshot you generated is\r\n```cpp\r\n        m_assumeutxo_data = MapAssumeutxo{\r\n            ...\r\n            {\r\n                694000,\r\n                {AssumeutxoHash{uint256S(\"0x2f47dc1e089b623a4bea57e0752b776df9e6885904d7ff8b14911b94c2208ff4\")}, 659945001},\r\n            },\r\n        };\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tested syncing to network tip with the 694000 snapshot, shutting down and booting back up at various points during the process, and it works for me. Thanks again for testing and finding bugs!",

Implicit conversions like this are not great in general because they can hide complexity and inefficiencies in the code, but this case is especially bad, because after the transition from `boost::filesystem` to `std::filesystem` in #20744 the behavior of this constructor on windows will be more complicated and can mangle path strings. The `fs::path` class also has a `.string()` method which is inverse of the constructor and has the same problems.\r\n\r\nFix this by replacing the unsafe method calls with `PathToString` and `PathFromString` function calls, and by forbidding unsafe method calls in the future.",

Furthermore static_cast<T>(...) allows for easier grepping of casts.\r\n\r\nFor a more thorough discussion, see \"ES.49: If you must use a cast, use a named cast\"\r\nin the C++ Core Guidelines (Stroustrup & Sutter).\r\n```\r\n\r\nModern tooling, specifically `-Wold-style-cast` can enable us to enforce never using C-style casts. I believe this is especially important due to the number of C-style casts the codebase is currently being used as a reinterpret_cast. reinterpret_casts are especially dangerous, and should never be done via C-style casts.\r\n\r\nUpdate the docs to suggest the use of named cast or functional casts.",

In short, it\r\n- only emits existing ValidationInterface events for the active chain,\r\n- introduces a BackgroundBlockConnected event for the background chain to support indexation, and\r\n- removes assumptions in the indexing framework that indexation will happen sequentially.\r\n\r\nMore details below.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdds BackgroundBlockConnected to the validationinterface and uses it in\r\nindex maintenance. Ensures that index building will work when part of\r\nthe chain is validated asynchronously in the background by a second\r\nchainstate.\r\n\r\nThis changeset removes the guarantee that indexes will be built\r\nsequentially, as none of the current indexes require this and it is no\r\nlonger easy to offer this guarantee when multiple chainstates are in\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nWithin BaseIndex, we only update `m_best_block_index` (which is\r\nessentially the progress marker for how far along the indexing process\r\nis) for chains which we can be certain that all blocks under a given\r\nblock on that chain have had indexing performed on them.  In other\r\nwords, we will not update `m_best_block_index` during a BlockConnected\r\nevent that comes from an active snapshot chain, i.e. a chain for which\r\nsome of the blocks underneath Tip() are not indexed.\r\n\r\nOnce background validation is completed and no background chainstates\r\nare in use, the indexer will happily use BlockConnected events from the\r\nactive chain to update `m_best_block_index` as usual. No blocks from the\r\nactive chainstate will have been missed for indexing (despite not\r\npreviously updating m_best_block_index), so it is safe to perform this\r\ntransition without any extra behavior.\r\n\r\nSome unnecessary logic from BaseIndex::ChainStateFlushed() is removed,\r\nsince the locator can no longer be assumed to be an ancestor of the\r\nbest_block_index (since the \"best block\" may be on a background chainstate\r\nand the locator may have come from an assumed-valid tip well ahead of\r\nit).",

Various pieces of net_processing logic have to be modified in order to support block download that is simultaneous across numerous chainstates.\r\n\r\nChanges include\r\n\r\n- Modify FindNextBlocksToDownload() to parameterize the chainstate\r\n  being worked on.\r\n\r\n- Change GetNodeStateStats to take the max nCommonHeight per peer across\r\n  all chainstates.\r\n\r\n- Add CNodeState::chainstate_to_last_common_block\r\n  * we need this to allow handling for a single peer to distinguish\r\n    between separate chainstates we're simultaneously downloading blocks for\r\n\r\n- Share `requests_available` across chainstates when finding the next blocks\r\n  to download (during calls to FindNextBlocksToDownload()).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR shares commit https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/commit/17906dd52543fb75d2c45de884799b35ec5721f4 with #24006, and is included here so that the two changes can be reviewed in parallel.\r\n\r\nThis PR excludes a small net_processing commit, https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/commit/3e6164d96f9a42ecbf34359f6fd1af5413346933, which will be proposed for merge after #24006 since it relies on the introduction of the `BackgroundBlockConnected()` validationinterface event that the indexing changes introduce.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome commits here are best reviewed with `--ignore-space-change`.\r\n\r\nUnit-testing net_processing is notoriously difficult and with that in mind I haven't included any unittests here, but in parallel with review of these changes I will attempt to write some tests. Note that this behavior is covered in the functional tests included in the parent PR: https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/commit/c4949f2daf05289e76123b3c705277bf735a79d6",

This is currently based on the locktime only, not nSequence, thus wrong. Fix this by removing the clumsy code and treat all unconfirmed txs as unconfirmed. The GUI already prints whether a tx is in the mempool, in which case the user knows that the tx wasn't locked until a future time. If the tx is not in the mempool, it might be better to report the exact reject reason from the mempool instead of using incorrect heuristics.\r\n\r\n## Confirmed txs in the wallet\r\n\r\nThe wallet drops coins that it incorrectly assumes to be locked until a future time, even if they are already confirmed in the chain. This is because the wallet is using the wrong time (adjusted network time) instead of MTP, due to the `-1` default argument of `CheckFinalTx`.\r\n\r\nThe issues are fixed in separate commits and there is even a test.",

          "body": "When an index thread receives an interrupt during init before it got to index anything (so `m_best_block_index == nullptr` still), it will still try to commit previous \"work\" before stopping the thread. That means that `BaseIndex::CommitInternal()` calls `GetLocator(nullptr)`, which returns an locator to the tip ([code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/06b6369766137756648b3cb62c8f385cca234e69/src/chain.cpp#L31-L32)), and saves it to the index DB.\r\nOn the next startup, this locator will be read and it will be assumed that we have successfully synced the index to the tip, when in reality we have indexed nothing.\r\nIn the case of coinstatsindex, this would lead to a shutdown of bitcoind without any indication what went wrong. For the other indexes, there would be no immediate shutdown, but the index would be corrupt.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by not committing when `m_best_block_index==nullptr`, and it also adds an error log message to the silent coinstatsindex shutdown path.\r\n\r\nThis is another small bug found by `feature_init.py` - the second commit enables blockfilterindex and coinstatsindex for this test, enabling coinstatsindex without the first commit would have led to frequent failures.",

It also handles removing the snapshot chainstate data on-disk in the event that the snapshot fails to validate.\r\n\r\nAs detailed in [assumeutxo.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/assumeutxo.md#background-chainstate-hits-snapshot-base-block):\r\n\r\n> Once the tip of the background chainstate hits the base block of the snapshot chainstate, we stop use of the background chainstate by setting m_stop_use, in CompleteSnapshotValidation(), which is checked in ActivateBestChain()). We hash the background chainstate's UTXO set contents and ensure it matches the compiled value in CMainParams::m_assumeutxo_data.\r\n> \r\n> The background chainstate data lingers on disk until shutdown, when in ChainstateManager::Reset(), the background chainstate is cleaned up with ValidatedSnapshotShutdownCleanup(), which renames the chainstate_[hash] datadir as chainstate.\r\n>\r\n> **Failure consideration**: if bitcoind unexpectedly halts after m_stop_use is set on the background chainstate but before CompleteSnapshotValidation() can finish, the need to complete snapshot validation will be detected on subsequent init by ChainstateManager::CheckForUncleanShutdown().\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n~~Most of this change is unittested, though some logic (anything assuming on-disk leveldb data) can't be tested without some rework of unittest setup, given in-memory leveldb instances are used. I can look into how difficult this would be.~~\r\n\r\nThis change adds the ability to unittest using on-disk leveldb coins dbs.\r\n\r\n#### Possible follow-ups\r\n\r\n- [ ] Unify `CDBWrapper::{m_path,m_is_memory}`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24232#discussion_r855354180",

It also improves indexing sync logic, which is moved out of indexing code to a new [`node::SyncChain()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/8d8cdcb37005030f646ba3c45f7f54f556efb8bf/src/node/chain.h#L24-L39) function.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the commits in this PR are small refactoring changes that move code from `src/index/` to `src/node/`, or replace references to node types like `CBlockIndex`, `CChain`, `CChainState` in index code. There are only two commits affecting indexing sync logic which make complicated or substantive changes:\r\n\r\n- [`8746b35301c5` indexes: Rewrite chain sync logic, remove racy init](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/8746b35301c5f65ff3200555fb2b82417fd2c758)\r\n- [`ad88f50ddd12` indexes: Initialize indexes without holding cs_main](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/ad88f50ddd129dddd974bbf9fd7d86ec86b65508)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commit messages have more details about these and other changes. Followups to this PR will reuse indexing sync code for wallets (#15719, #11756) and let indexes run in separate processes (#10102)",

In the child classes, this allows having only public and private members. This change also help contributors add virtual functions into the correct section. Also rename the `GetName()` getters to `GetIndexName()` for clarity and easier grepping/reviewing.\r\n\r\nSome context:\r\n\r\nA base class virtual function doesn't need to be accessible to be overridden, but it can only be `private` if fully overridden, e.g. no inherited base implementation is used by the child classes.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n- https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/virtual: \"Base::vf does not need to be accessible or visible to be overridden. (Base::vf can be declared private, or Base can be inherited using private inheritance.)\"\r\n\r\n- \"An implementation member should be protected if it provides an operation or data that a derived class will need to use in its own implementation. Otherwise, implementation members should be private.\" - C++ Primer (Lippman, Lajoie, Moo)\r\n\r\n- Herb Sutter in http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill18.htm: \"Make virtual functions private, and only if derived classes need to invoke the base implementation of a virtual function, make the virtual function protected. Prefer to make interfaces non-virtual using the Template pattern.\"\r\n",

The original PR grew larger than expected throughout the review process.\r\n\r\nThis change adds the ability to initialize a snapshot-based chainstate during init if one is detected on disk. This is of course unused as of now (aside from in unittests) given that we haven't yet enabled actually loading snapshots. \r\n\r\nDon't be scared! There are some big move-only commits in here.\r\n\r\nAccompanying changes include: \r\n\r\n- moving the snapshot coinsdb directory from being called `chainstate_[base blockhash]` to `chainstate_snapshot`, since we only support one snapshot in use at a time. This simplifies some logic, but it necessitates writing that base blockhash out to a file within the coinsdb dir. See [discussion here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24232#discussion_r832762880).\r\n- adding a simple fix in `FlushBlockFile()` that avoids a crash when attemping to flush to disk before `LoadBlockIndexDB()` is called, which happens when calling `MaybeRebalanceCaches()` during multiple chainstate init.\r\n- improving the unittest to allow testing with on-disk chainstates - necessary to test a simulated restart and re-initialization.",

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nSize of the serialized UTXO set\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nThe serialization format of the serialized UTXO set from `dumptxoutset` is a list of `(COutPoint, Coin)`.\r\n\r\nHowever, many out points refer to the same transaction so we can group by `Txid` with:\r\n`list(Txid, list((vout,Coin))`\r\n\r\nSince the cursor is already iterating through sorted `Txid` this doesn't add complexity to the serialization code.\r\n\r\nConsidering the UTXO at height 745995:\r\n```\r\nserialized_size: ~5.3Gb\r\ntotal_elements: 83_082_178\r\nuniques_txids: 49_517_483\r\nbytes_lost: total_elements // due to the additional byte for the length of the inner list\r\nbytes_savings: (total_elements-unique_txids)*32 - bytes_lost ~= 1Gb\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nAdditional bytes could be saved by leveraging the duplications in scripts (address reuse). However, this is not considered worthy because the format would lose the streaming property and also because we don't want to optimize on something which is not recommended.\r\n\r\nThe byte lost for expressing the length of the inner list could be optimized with a special byte containing both the length of the list and the first vout, since usually both vout and this value are very small they should fit on a single byte most of the time having a fallback for edge cases.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nTagging @jamesob author of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16899\r\nassumeutxo summary https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606\r\n",

          "body": "This is part of the [assumeutxo project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/11) (parent PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606)\r\n\r\nPart two of replacing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24232.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen a user activates a snapshot, the serialized UTXO set data is used to create an \"assumed-valid\" chainstate, which becomes active in an attempt to get the node to network tip as quickly as possible. Simultaneously in the background, the already-existing chainstate continues \"conventional\" IBD to both accumulate full block data and serve as a belt-and-suspenders to validate the assumed-valid chainstate.\r\n\r\nOnce the background chainstate's tip reaches the base block of the snapshot used, we set `m_stop_use` on that chainstate and immediately take the hash of its UTXO set; we verify that this matches the assumeutxo value in the source code. Note that while we ultimately want to remove this background chainstate, we don't do so until the following initialization process, when we again check the UTXO set hash of the background chainstate, and if it continues to match, we remove the (now unnecessary) background chainstate, and move the (previously) assumed-valid chainstate into its place. We then reinitialize the chainstate in the normal way.\r\n\r\nAs noted in previous comments, we could do the filesystem operations \"inline\" immediately when the background validation completes, but that's basically just an optimization that saves disk space until the next restart. It didn't strike me as worth the risk of moving chainstate data around on disk during runtime of the node, though maybe my concerns are overblown.\r\n\r\nThe final result of this completion process is a fully-validated chain, where the only evidence that the user synced using assumeutxo is the existence of a `base_blockhash` file in the `chainstate` directory.\r\n",

We can check for the tip block there and pass that into `UpdatedBlockTip` to avoid having the zmq notifier read the block. This also has the benefit of removing the `node/blockstorage.h` dependency entirely from the zmq code, so we can continue working to remove `ReadBlockFromDisk` out of global scope (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26316#discussion_r1000954807).",

This is not optimal, since as a stand-alone library it should not rely on bitcoind's argument parsing logic. Instead, its interfaces should accept control and options structs that control the kernel library's desired configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar work towards decoupling the `ArgsManager` from the kernel has been done in \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25527 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25862.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\nBy moving the `CChainParams` class definition into the kernel and giving it new factory functions `CChainParams::{RegTest,SigNet,Main,TestNet}`it can be constructed without an `ArgsManager` reference, unlike the current factory function `CreateChainParams`.\r\n\r\nThe first few commits remove uses of `ArgsManager` within `CChainParams`. Then the `CChainParams` definition is moved to a new file in the `kernel/` subdirectory.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Keeping them as compile-time evaluatable constants also has a (likely negligible) performance impact (avoiding runtime modulo operations).\r\n* If we want to make sure the chainparams and headerssync params don't go out of date, it could be possible to run the script in CI, and and possibly even have the parameters be generated automatically at build time. I think that's overkill for how unfrequently these need to change, and running the script has non-trivial cost (~minutes in the normal python interpreter).\r\n* A viable alternative is just leaving this out-of-repo entirely, and just do ad-hoc updating from time to time. Having it in the repo and release notes does make sure it's not forgotten, though adds a cost to contributors/maintainers who follow the process.",

This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations.\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives & design notes\r\n\r\nThe main goal for the `util::Result` class is to provide a standard way for functions to report error and warnings strings. The interface tries to make it easy to provide detailed error feedback to end users, without cluttering code or making it harder to return other result information. There have been multiple iterations of the design using different internal representations and providing different capabilities:\r\n\r\n|   | Representation (approximate)                   | Notes |\r\n|---|------------------------------------------------|-------|\r\n| _1_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Original #25218 implementation in da98fd2efc1a6b9c6e876cf3e227a8c2e9a10827. Good capabilities, but larger type size. Supports error standardized error reporting and customized error handling with failure values. |\r\n| _2_ | `variant<T,bilingual_str>`                | Final #25218 implementation in 7a45c33d1f8a758850cf8e7bd6ad508939ba5c0d. No support for returning failure values so not useful in many cases.\r\n| _3_ | `variant<monostate,T,F>`                 | Pending #25601 implementation that allows choosing whether to use standardized error reporting or return custom failure values, but doesn't support having both at the same time, like approaches _(1)_, _(4)_, _(5)_, _(6)_ do. |\r\n | _4_ | `tuple<variant<T,F>,bilingual_str>`      | Original #25608 implementation in c29d3008de9314dd463ed08e8bff39fe55324498. Basically the same as _(1)_ except it uses separate success and failure types instead of the same type. Using separate success and failure types makes the result class a little less flexible but can help avoid some ambiguity and inconsistent result states. |\r\n| _5_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Final #25608 implementation in dd91f294206ac87b213d23bb76656a0a5f0f4781. Essentially the same as original implementation _(1)_ except has some usability improvements. |\r\n| _6_ | `tuple<T,unique_ptr<tuple<F,bilingual_str>>` | Pending #25665 implementation (this PR). Supports returning failure values, uses separate success and failure types to avoid ambiguity, uses `unique_ptr` to reduce result type size, and avoids heap allocation in the happy path. |\r\n\r\n### Prior discussions & history\r\n\r\n- _furszy_ introduced a `BResult` class providing a standard error reporting mechanism in [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218). It was renamed to `util::Result` in [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) but kept the same representation and capabilities.\r\n\r\n- _MarcoFalke_ suggested using `BResult` for the `LoadChainstate` function in [#25308 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25308#issuecomment-1181674645). Inability to use `BResult` there due to lack of support for failure values led to initial work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _w0xlt_ wrote a `StructuredResult` class in [#25308](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25601) adding the ability to return failure values but sacrificing standard error reporting, which led to more work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _martinus_ suggested a space optimization in [#25608 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608#discussion_r921049409) that also made it easier to support distinct failure & success types, leading to [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) as a replacement for [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).",

This is now being done a bit later in  `ThreadSync()`, which has existing logic to call the custom `Rewind()` method when going back along the chain to the forking point (thanks ryanofsky for pointing this out to me!).\r\n\r\n**2) Allow using the `-reindex-chainstate` option without needing to disabling indexes**:\r\nWith `BaseIndex::Init()` not calling `FindForkInGlobalIndex()` anymore, we can allow `reindex-chainstate` with active indexes. `reindex-chainstate` deletes the chain and rebuilds it later in `ThreadImport`, so there is no chain available during `BaseIndex::Init()`, which would lead to problems (see #24789).\r\nBut now we'll only need the chain a bit later in `BaseIndex::ThreadSync`, which will wait for the reindex-chainstate in `ThreadImport` to finish and will continue syncing after that.",

          "body": "The block index might contain stale blocks that are not part of the main chain. If a malicious peer is able to probe a node's block index for certain stale blocks then it can use this information to fingerprint the node.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving headers (either through a `cmpctblock` or `headers` messages) a node will send `getheaders` if the predecessor of the first header does not exist. This leaks information from the block index if the predecessor of the header is a stale block because no `getheaders` will be sent in that case revealing that the stale block exists in the index.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents this fingerprinting by sending additional `getheaders` messages in cases where not doing so leaks the existence of stale blocks. To determine when additional messages should be send, we introduce the `PeerManagerImpl::m_chain_tips_sets` map which keeps track of seen chain tips per network, effectively creating a per network view of the node's global block index.  We only try to accept new headers if they connect to anything in our global index and they connect to our active chain or to a chain that was previously sent to us by a peer on the same network. We send a `getheaders` message should these conditions not be met.",

It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

          "body": "I got a little nerd sniped by this idea, so I created this draft. I have done very little testing so far (syncing signet worked, currently syncing mainnet).\r\n\r\nThis PR does two things when running in prune mode: (a) assume witness merkle roots to be valid for assumed-valid blocks and (b) request assumed-valid blocks without `MSG_WITNESS_FLAG`.\r\n\r\nIn theory this is a good idea, because witnesses are not validated (i.e. they are assumed valid up to a certain block `-assumevalid`) and get pruned anyway when running in prune mode, so not downloading them (for assumed-valid blocks) reduces the bandwidth that is needed for IBD (don't have any numbers on this yet).\r\n\r\nOne downside is that nodes serving blocks without witnesses can't serve them directly from disk. They have to un-serialize and re-serialize without the witnesses before sending them.\r\n\r\nEven though this is a draft, conceptual and approach review is very welcome.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] a bunch of tests\r\n- [ ] edge cases around manually pruned nodes (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#issuecomment-1419751142)\r\n- [ ] make sure we are not advertising blocks with witnesses when we in fact do not have the witnesses (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#issuecomment-1419443888, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#issuecomment-1419751142)\r\n- [ ] edge case when restarting with different assume valid settings (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#issuecomment-1419751142)\r\n- [ ] document that it's a change in what constitutes assumevalid (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#issuecomment-1419611954)\r\n- [ ] always serve pre-segwit blocks straight from disk (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#discussion_r1097532417)",

Destroying the workers pool once the\r\ninitial sync completes.\r\nNote: by default, the parallelized sync process is not enabled.\r\n\r\nNow the juicy part:\r\nIn my computer, with the node in debug mode and on IBD, with `-indexworkers=4`, the\r\nblock filter index generation took less than an hour. While, in master, the sync took more than 7 hours.\r\n\r\nImportant Note:\r\nAs the access to the block data on disk is protected by `cs_main`, this new feature runs substantially\r\nfaster when the node is not in IBD.\r\n\r\nFootnote:\r\nThis is part of a larger project :).",

      "body": "CI trips over:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/validation.cpp:5721:1: \r\nerror: \r\nreturn type 'const ChainstateRole' is 'const'-qualified at the top level, which may reduce code readability without improving const correctness [readability-const-return-type,-warnings-as-errors]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI made a snapshot at height 780,000 and then loaded it.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Oops...</summary>\r\n But instead of finishing towards the tip, it started the background sync:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"height\": 780050,\r\n    \"hash\": \"000000000000000000043cfdd430cbcf5d6cfa0c437ad5b808e1d45dc509387e\",\r\n    \"branchlen\": 771607,\r\n    \"status\": \"headers-only\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"height\": 8443,\r\n    \"hash\": \"00000000ee985adaa7242745800b7702d48558fbc517358be4fb597368f8b217\",\r\n    \"branchlen\": 0,\r\n    \"status\": \"active\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is because the assume valid block was (unrealistically) close to the tip?\r\n\r\nI used the commits in this PR, but cleanly rebased on #24008 (replacing the first 6 commits here), and with a commit to modify the assumed valid block.\r\n\r\nI was able to produce this behaviour with a fresh datadir.\r\n\r\n_Update 10-3-2023_: I just tried again and noticed a log message that I probably overlooked: `[snapshot] bad snapshot content hash …`. This ~puzzling too, since I got the same sha256 hash when dumping the snapshot on both macOS and Ubuntu~ the umpteenth time I hardcoded a block hash instead of the content hash, ~but~ and it explains why IBD just went on as normal.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nIt made it to the tip and is now doing a background sync.\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed if that whenc syncing to the tip, it was showing `cache=3.0MiB` even though it was using ~15GB of ~cache~ RAM. This is strange, because #27008 is not part of this PR, so most of the RAM should have cleared up once the snapshot is loaded.\r\n\r\n~Also worrying is that~ once it reaches the tip, it doesn't immediately flush. (Update: that makes sense, because we recently flushed.) That causes the background sync to have very limited resources. It endup up flushing the cache when it reach 1751MB (which matches the coinstip cache of 818 MB plus my maxmempool of 1GB). (update: I think the problem is that it's not correctly rebalancing)\r\n\r\nStrangely it says `[snapshot] validated snapshot (811 MB)` and `[snapshot] (811 MB)`, which seems completely off since the snapshot should use about 12 GB (`-dbcache` was set high enough).\r\n\r\nOnce I restart the node it creates a more reasonable split between the background ibd (15555 MB) and snapshot chainstate caches (818 MB).\r\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed is that because it takes a while to load and process the snapshot, it triggers a timeout in p2p networking and we start querying DNS seeds again. Can be dealt with in a followup.\r\n\r\nLoading a wallet that last opened _before_ the assumevalid block fails gracefully, with a clear instruction to try again after sync reaches the snapshot height. Currently the GUI gives no indication that such a background sync is going on, but that's ok for now. The user must have used the RPC to trigger snapshot use, and loading an old wallet on fresh node is not a typical novice use case.",

          "body": "This pull request is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18 and more specifically its \"Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel\". This commit was originally authored by empact and is taken from its parent PR #25152.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nThere is an ongoing effort to decouple the `ArgsManager` used for command line parsing user-provided arguments from the libbitcoinkernel library (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25527, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25862, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26177, and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125). The `ArgsManager` is defined in `system.h`. A similar pull request extracting functionality from `system.h` has been merged in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27238.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\nNext to providing better code organization, this PR removes some reliance of the tree of libbitcoinkernel header includes on `system.h` (and thus the `ArgsManager` definition) by moving filesystem related functions out of the `system.*` files. \r\n\r\nThere is already a pair of `fs.h` / `fs.cpp` in the top-level `src/` directory. They were not combined with the files introduced here, to keep the patch cleaner and more importantly because they are often included without the utility functions. The new files are therefore named `fs_helpers` and the existing `fs` files are moved into the util directory.\r\n\r\nFurther commits splitting more functionality out of `system.h` are still in #25152 and will be submitted in separate PRs once this PR has been processed.",

          "body": "When running with `-debug=validation` the log is filled with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-03-19T12:46:01Z [validation] Enqueuing TransactionAddedToMempool: txid=37c8e1ef87d75a67fbaf44e116018fbc70d9c4ef0e27e2ae56861395101f9b8e wtxid=24e2d76012f9cde451d085ead4feab136feddae6cb55d37221a81aac6c0eaf42\r\n2023-03-19T12:46:01Z [validation] TransactionAddedToMempool: txid=37c8e1ef87d75a67fbaf44e116018fbc70d9c4ef0e27e2ae56861395101f9b8e wtxid=24e2d76012f9cde451d085ead4feab136feddae6cb55d37221a81aac6c0eaf42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese log entries are more appropriate for `-debug=mempool`.\r\n\r\nThis change limits `-debug=validation` to messages that are related to blocks and headers. It also downgrades `Enqueuing` messages to the `Trace` level.\r\n\r\nIt makes it easier to run for a long time without excessive log file growth. This debug category is particularly useful for keeping track of problematic headers that were seen, the timing of reorgs, see also #27276.\r\n\r\nSince this PR touches `validationinterface.cpp` anyway, it also includes a commit to drop function names from log messages, since we now have `-logsourcelocations`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, though less important, I moved `[validation] Pre-allocating up to position 0x… in rev….dat` messages to blockstorage. This reduces the number of `[validation]` log messages further. ~to 3 per (normal) block.~\r\n\r\n\r\nThe volume of log messages [could also have been reduced](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27277#discussion_r1141375638) by changing the log level of these messages to `trace`. Doing so would prevent a whack-a-mole game of moving log messages to different categories. However in this case I think the change in log category would be justified even if it didn't have a big impact on noise. I.e. someone running with `-debug=mempool` would expect to see the `TransactionAddedToMempool` messages and someone running with `-debug=blockstorage` would perhaps be surprised to not see the `Pre-allocating` message.",

It is also a follow up to #26177.\r\n\r\nIt replaces pull request https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27294, which just moved the constants to a new file, but did not re-declare them as enums.\r\n\r\nThe code move of the chain name constants out of the `chainparamsbase` to their own separate header allows the kernel `chainparams` to no longer include `chainparamsbase`. The `chainparamsbase` contain references to the `ArgsManager` and networking related options that should not belong to the kernel library. Besides this move, the constants are re-declared as enums with helper functions facilitating string conversions.",

          "body": "Closes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2039\r\n\r\nWhen reindexing from flat-file block storage there is no need to write anything back to disk, since the block data is already there. This PR skips flushing to disk those blocks that already have a known position in the datastore. Skipping this means that users can write-protect the `blk` files on disk which may be useful for security or even safely sharing that data between multiple bitcoind instances.\r\n\r\n`FindBlockPos()` may also flush the undo data file, but again this is skipped if the corresponding block position is known, like during the initial stage of a reindex when block data is being indexed. Once the block index is complete the validation mechanism will call `ConnectBlock()` which will save undo data at that time.\r\n\r\nThe call stack looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninit()\r\nThreadImport() <-- process fReindex flag\r\nLoadExternalBlockFile()\r\nAcceptBlock()\r\nSaveBlockToDisk()\r\nFindBlockPos()\r\nFlushBlockFile() <-- unnecessary if block is already on disk\r\n```\r\n\r\nA larger refactor of this part of the code was started by mzumsande here:  https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/202207_refactor_findblockpos including this fix, reviewers can let me know if the changes should be combined.\r\n",

      "body": "Alright! This is fully rebased and passing CI. Copy/pasteable testing instructions follow.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure these are the complete changes necessary to enable use of assumeutxo (via `loadtxoutset`), including pruning and index use. It's worth noting that 200 of these lines are an elaborate demo shell script and another good chunk of this is airy RPC code, so this 1200 line diff is maybe more approachable than it appears.\r\n\r\n### Recent changes\r\n\r\n- [x] I've segmented blockfile storage into \"assumed\" vs. \"normal\" files to avoid doing drastic mixing of heights. As the code was written, we had snapshot and ibd chainstates pushing into the same space of blockfiles, which makes pruning ineffectual for a decent chunk of the chain. This is now fixed.\r\n- [x] Ironed out all the indexing issues in a relatively simple way. Indexation now happens strictly sequentially, along the background chainstate (which is just a continuation of the \"regular\" chainstate that we initialize with before running `loadtxoutset` and creating the snapshot chainstate). Validationinterface events in the indexers are ignored for the snapshot chainstate; once we complete background validation, the indexers are restarted and continue (sequentially) into the previously unindexed region of the chain.\r\n- [x] I've renamed `monitorsnapshot` (a utility RPC) to `getchainstates`.\r\n- [x] Lotta rebase and bug fixes.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### For fun (~5min)\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a quick test, you can run `./contrib/devtools/test_utxo_snapshots.sh` and follow the instructions. This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (https://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl https://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\nHave fun and hope it works!\r\n\r\n#### Known weird behavior\r\n\r\n- [ ] The last few blocks to get the snapshot chainstate to tip seem to take a while to roll in... I'm not sure what's going on here. It eventually syncs, but not as fast as I would think.\r\n- [x] If you restart the node in the middle of the bg sync, `nChainTx` for the snapshot chain will not properly repopulate and your `progress=` for the snapshot chainstate will be weird. I *think* there's an easy fix for this, which I'm investigating.\r\n\r\n#### Next steps\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll open a PR that's this changeset but without the pruning changes, as suggested by @sdaftuar. If we decide it's preferable to wait on pruning we can, but I think the LOC delta is only maybe a hundred lines or so. Conceptually the diff might be bigger of course. Curious what others think here, given this (relatively complete?) set of changes.",

It makes UTXO snapshots loadable via RPC (`loadtxoutset`) and adds `assumeutxo` parameters to chainparams. It contains all the remaining changes necessary to both use an assumedvalid snapshot chainstate and do a full validation sync in the background.\r\n\r\nThis may look like a lot to review, but note that\r\n- ~200 lines are a (non-essential) demo shell script\r\n- Many lines are functional test, documentation, and relatively dilute RPC code.\r\n\r\nSo it shouldn't be as burdensome to review as the linecount might suggest.\r\n\r\n- **P2P**: minor changes are made to `init.cpp` and `net_processing.cpp` to make simultaneous IBD across multiple chainstates work.\r\n- **Pruning**: implement correct pruning behavior when using a background chainstate\r\n- **Blockfile separation**: to prevent \"fragmentation\" in blockfile storage, have background chainstates use separate blockfiles from active snapshot chainstates to avoid interleaving heights and impairing pruning.\r\n- **Indexing**: some `CValidationInterface` events are given with an additional parameter, ChainstateRole, and all indexers ignore events from ChainstateRole::ASSUMEDVALID so that indexation only happens sequentially.\r\n- Have `-reindex` properly wipe snapshot chainstates.\r\n- **RPC**: introduce RPC commands `loadtxoutset` and (hidden) `getchainstates`.\r\n- **Release docs & first assumeutxo commitment**: add notes and a particular assumeutxo hash value for first AU-enabled release.\r\n  - This will complete the project and allow use of UTXO snapshots for faster node bootstrap.\r\n\r\nThe next phase, if it were to be pursued, would be coming up with a way to distribute the UTXO snapshots over the P2P network.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### UTXO snapshots\r\n\r\nCreate your own with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh`, e.g. \r\n```shell\r\n./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh 788000 utxo.dat ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$(pwd)/testdata`)\r\n```\r\nor use the pre-generated ones listed below.\r\n\r\n- Testnet: **2'500'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:511e09f4bf853aefab00de5c070b1e031f0ecbe9&dn=utxo-testnet-2500000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n  - sha256: `79db4b025448cc0ac388d8589a28eab02de53055d181e34eb47391717aa16388`\r\n- Signet: **160'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:9da986cb27b3980ea7fd06b21e199b148d486880&dn=utxo-signet-160000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n  - sha256: `eeeca845385ba91e84ef58c09d38f98f246a24feadaad57fe1e5874f3f92ef8c`\r\n- Mainnet: **800'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - Note: this needs the following commit cherry-picked in: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/commit/24deb2022b822f22fba9fcbee201e37a83225eb2\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:50ee955bef37f5ec3e5b0df4cf0288af3d715a2e&dn=utxo-800000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### For fun (~5min)\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a quick test, you can run `./contrib/devtools/test_utxo_snapshots.sh` and follow the instructions. This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob assumeutxo\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/assumeutxo\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.",

Closes #25675.\r\n\r\nThis builds on the work done in #26045, addresses open feedback, adds some further improvements (most importantly usage of compact size), documentation, and an additional test.\r\n\r\nThe [original snapshot at height 830,000](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29551) came in at 10.82 GB. With this change, the same snapshot is 8.94 GB, a reduction of 17.4%.\r\n\r\nThis also enhances the metadata of the output file and adds the following data to allow for better error handling and make future upgrades easier:\r\n- A newly introduced utxo set magic\r\n- A version number\r\n- The network magic\r\n- The block height",

I get that BlockMetadataManager is a singleton shared between multiple chainstates, but I think it's a mistake to add global references to it all over the code. If you could add a `BlockMetadataManager& m_blockmetaman` member to CChainState (also needs forward declaration and initialization in constructor), and replace \r\n`g_blockmetaman` with `m_blockmetaman` where possible, I think it would help make relationship between the classes clearer, and also be a step in the direction of making validation code more testable and possible to break apart.",

Just imagining seeing this code for the first time, I would expect the \"db\" object to be the object I should be reading and writing state to, and the \"cache\" object to be something used for optimization that I shouldn't mess around with.\r\n\r\nIn reality though, almost all code should be using the \"cache\" object and ignoring the \"db\" object, so I think \"cache\" is not a great name and \"tip\" would be better shorthand because this is the view you should be using if you care about data at the state of the tip.",

I'm not sure if jimpo intended this to happen when he wrote it, but because `m_chain` has no entries the latch flips immediately. So the above discussion is not moot, and this (maybe surprising) behavior should probably be documented in `BaseIndex`. I may do that in a separate PR soon.",

When you've got two separate chainstates throwing off BlockConnected events, you basically have to reserve updating that pointer for the background chainstate because otherwise you're breaking the nature of the best block pointer. Updating the index when you get an assumed-valid chainstate event would mean that there are unindexed blocks beneath the pointer.\r\n\r\nI've tried to think about ways to avoid this situation, but haven't been able to figure out anything simpler. If you've got ideas, I'm definitely curious and happy to implement.",
