This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Original change description\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with assumeutxo, here's a brief summary from [the issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15605) (where any conceptual discussion not specific to this implementation should happen):\r\n\r\n> assumeutxo would be a way to initialize a node using a headers chain and a serialized version of the UTXO state which was generated from another node at some block height. A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n> \r\n> This would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly (and with less disk usage) than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip. Needless to say this is at expense of accepting a different trust model, though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nIn short, this is an interesting change because it would allow nodes to get up and running within minutes given a ~3GB file (at time of writing) under an almost identical trust model to assumevalid.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I add a few RPC commands: `dumptxoutset` creates a UTXO snapshot and writes it to disk, and `loadtxoutset` intakes a snapshot from disk, constructs and activates chainstate based on it, and continues a from-scratch initial block download in the background for the sole purpose of validating the snapshot. Once the snapshot is validated, we throw away the chainstate used for background validation.\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo procedure as implemented is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A UTXO snapshot is loaded with the `loadtxoutset <path>` RPC command.\r\n1. A new chainstate (`CChainState`) is initialized using `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`:\r\n   1. The serialized UTXO data is read in and various sanity checks are performed, e.g. compare expected coin count, recompute the hash and compare it with assumeutxo hash in source code.\r\n   1. We \"fast forward\" `new_chainstate->m_chain` to have a tip at the base of the snapshot (with or without block data). Lacking block data, we fake the `nTx` counts of the constituent `CBlockIndex` entries.\r\n   1. `LoadChainTip()` is called on the new snapshot and it is installed as our active chainstate.\r\n1. The new assumed-valid chainstate is now our active, and so that enters IBD until it is synced to the network's tip. Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n1. Once the active chainstate is out of IBD, our old validation chain continues IBD \"in the background\" while the active chainstate services requests from most of the system.\r\n1. Once the background validation chainstate reaches a height equal the base of the snapshot, we take the hash of its UTXO set and ensure it equals the expected hash based on the snapshot. If the hashes are equivalent, we delete the validation chainstate and move on without event; if they aren't, we log loudly and fall back to the validation chainstate (we should probably just shut down).\r\n\r\nThe implicit assumption is that the background validation chain will always be a subset of the assumed-valid snapshot chain while the latter is active. We don't properly handle reorgs that go deeper than the base of the snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Changes (already merged/outdated)\r\n\r\n![chainstate-beforeafter (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/54435797-a16b0780-4707-11e9-89c3-c90b5686804d.png)\r\n \r\nThe crux of this change is in removing any assumptions in the codebase that there is a single chainstate, i.e. any references to global variables `chainActive`, `pcoinsTip`, et al. need to be replaced with functions that return the relevant chainstate data at that moment in time. This change also takes `CChainState` to its logical conclusion by making it more self-contained - any references to globals like `chainActive` are removed with class-local references (`m_chain`).\r\n\r\nA few minor notes on the implementation:\r\n\r\n- When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\n- For additional notes, see [the new assumeutxo docs](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/blob/utxo-dumpload-compressed/doc/assumeutxo.md).",

      "body": "> Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, the snapshot can't be terribly recent for the user of it or it breaks the security model. Assume valid only has any security at all if there is time for the review and communication about review to happen, which means a human timescale of at least weeks.\r\n\r\nProbably the assumption should be that snapshots are created pretty close to tip, just far enough to avoid wasting time in reorgs (even 6 blocks would be fine) but the users aren't using them until they are quite a bit older, likely using the second to most recent available one.\r\n\r\n> We don't serve blocks or transactions to the network while we're operating with an unvalidated snapshot-based chain.\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't do that.  The worst that getting it wrong does is getting us disconnected from peers, which isn't particularly cosmic (and at least we might notice that something is going wrong).  The downside of it is that not forwarding transactions shoots our privacy in the head, since any transaction we're emitting would be one we created.\r\n\r\n> When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\nSounds good.\r\n\r\n>  compare it with the claimed hash in the snapshot metadata.\r\n\r\nThis is a zero security approach.  You can't just ask the user for a value and then accept that. The attack is to reorg the chain and then announce to everyone that there is a node bug and you need to run this command to continue, we specifically engineered out that possibility in assumevalid.  This isn't hypothetical, this is exactly what we've seen happen in ethereum w/ fastsync.\r\n\r\nThis is a fine setup for testing your PR however!    Ultimately we should get it to a state where a (FEC-split) copy of the state is loaded from the network and where it can be tested against a publicly reviewed constants configured in the software and/or blockchain.",

That way reviewers could see the more interesting changes without having to go through all the mind-numbing renames.",

I spent the last few days reconstructing the changeset into sensible commits - hopefully it's easier to understand this way.\r\n\r\nMost of the early commits are just shuffling stuff around (though all of it strictly necessary AFAICT). I've phrased the changes as much as possible as scripted-diffs and move-onlys. In replaying the changes, I found a few unnecessary diffs to omit.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has additional suggestions for how this could be made easier to review, I'm all ears, though I'm not holding my breath waiting until some Concept (N)ACKs roll in on #15605.

I'm not getting any warnings during compilation when using clang 9.0.0 and gcc 7.3.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.2.\r\n\r\n> I don't think an RPC method is the right tool for loading a snapshot (it's fine for saving); probably better to just specify a location at launch.\r\n\r\nLoading snapshot only on startup would simplify things in the short run, but ultimately if we're going to share snapshots over the P2P network, we'll need to support loading them at runtime. Better to test that process out earlier IMO.\r\n\r\n> I waited for it to fetch a few blocks and tried again, but same error...\r\n\r\nOops, looks like I introduced a bug during a recent rebase. Fixing now. Thanks for testing!\r\n\r\n> Can you add an actual assumeutxo value (mainnet & testnet)?\r\n\r\nYep, I'll do this in the next day or so.\r\n\r\n> To facilitate writing functional tests, you could allow a -assumeutxo param for regtest only.\r\n\r\nYep, this seems like a good idea.

      "body": "@Sjors thanks very much for testing.\r\n\r\n> it crashed when I stopped the node and started it again\r\n\r\nYou found a bug in how the init process interacts with an assumed-valid chainstate. I needed to add `nChainTx` reconstruction to `LoadBlockIndex()` and make some allowances for the assumed-valid chain in `RewindBlockIndex()`. The details of the fix are mostly contained in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/7d10a00daca80c6a8e68196ae7c016c1123d91fe, but we also now write `BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS` into the appropriate CBlockIndex entries during snapshot activation (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/7bfbb78b445efbefa5238b4d23290ad4d4db05cf#diff-24efdb00bfbe56b140fb006b562cc70bR5001).\r\n\r\n> Consider pausing IBD while loading the file.\r\n\r\nOn your advice I'm now acquiring `cs_main` during snapshot activation for clarity when testing, but I think that closer to merge we should undo this. The snapshot chainstate can populate on a separate thread while traditional IBD starts and I don't think either slows the other down since they're running on separate threads and writing to separate data structures (the block index excluded).\r\n\r\nNote that you can isolate most of the snapshot-related logs with `tail -f debug.log | grep '[snapshot]'`.\r\n\r\n> Once we reach the tip and it starts syncing from genesis in the background, the log is too quiet.\r\n\r\nI've added a `[background validation] UpdateTip: ...` message for every 2000 blocks synced in the background.\r\n\r\n> How do plan to handle block pruning?\r\n\r\nSince we don't expect (or support handling) reorgs in the background validation chainstate, we prune it aggressively (within 1 block of tip; see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/e37372a0236b12dff422eaeca643db7d64f58b48#diff-24efdb00bfbe56b140fb006b562cc70bR3635). Given current pruning precision, this seems like a rounding error and so I think should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThanks again for testing. The most recent version of this PR is rebased and should be usable.",

I think we should keep this in for at least one release, because it's easier than the `grep` approach. It could also make sense to wait ~60 seconds after the snapshot is loaded before resuming the original IBD. That way the log looks like:\r\n* IBD...\r\n* rpc call to load snapshot (if RPC debug is enabled)\r\n* pauze IBD\r\n* loading snapshot\r\n* snapshot loaded, begin sync from snapshot\r\n* little bit of sync from snapshot\r\n* IBD resumed\r\n* interwoven log entries from both syncs\r\n\r\n> we prune it aggressively (within 1 block of tip)\r\n\r\nPruning normally flushes `dbcache` though, are you preventing that?\r\n\r\n> Maybe a `background:` key that contains a nested version of the same information?\r\n\r\nThat seems better (or `snapshot`), since otherwise you have to call `monitorsnapshot` to even find out anything is happening.",

Easiest solution is for the demo script to check if `initialblockdownload` is `false`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps related, but I managed to corrupt the node that I took the snapshot from:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-05-08T17:35:39Z Checking all blk files are present...\r\n2019-05-08T17:35:40Z Initializing chainstate Chainstate [ibd] @ height -1 (null)\r\nbitcoind: validation.cpp:2448: void CChainState::PruneBlockIndexCandidates(): Assertion `!setBlockIndexCandidates.empty()' failed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI recovered with `-reindex` and then made the snapshot more carefully.\r\n\r\nWhen I restart the node during the snapshot sync, I notice that `monitorsnapshot` returns the wrong values for verification_progress of `snapshot` (e.g. `0.142`) which doesn't go up much until you restart again (`initialblockdownload: false`). I restarted a few times, and then it suddenly showed 0.9999 again.\r\n\r\nThe new logging every 2000 blocks feature doesn't work after restart.\r\n\r\nThe snapshot successfully validated, but when I try to shutdown gracefully it doesn't get beyond the \"dumped mempool\" message. Probably a thread locking issue; no crazy CPU or memory usage. I had to use `kill -9`, but fortunately it still worked at the next start.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried pruning yet.",

We obviously don't necessarily need to preserve this value for merge, but I figure it's useful for testing and not unrealistic.\r\n\r\nYou can test this branch easily by running a script like\r\n```sh\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nset -e\r\nif [ ! -f ./src/bitcoind ]; then\r\n  echo \"Must be in built bitcoin directory.\"\r\n  exit 1\r\nfi\r\nSNAPSHOT_LOC=/tmp/utxo.600k.dat\r\nDATADIR=/tmp/bitcoin-assumeutxo-test\r\nmkdir -p $DATADIR\r\n\r\n[ -f ${SNAPSHOT_LOC} ] || curl -L https://storage.googleapis.com/assumeutxo/utxo.600k.dat > $SNAPSHOT_LOC\r\n/usr/bin/time -v ./src/bitcoind -datadir=$DATADIR -dbcache=4000 -stopatheight=604401 &\r\nsleep 60\r\n# Might timeout.\r\n/usr/bin/time -v ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATADIR loadtxoutset $SNAPSHOT_LOC || true\r\nfg %1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter running this you should end up with a node that's synced to tip within 60-90 minutes depending on your internet connection and hardware.\r\n\r\n### Benchmarking\r\n\r\nI've compared reindexing to height 550,000 for this branch vs. its base ([a la previous PRs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16801#issuecomment-551883348)), and beyond some outlier runs on both sides, this changeset seems to be comparable in performance to master.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhost         tag                      time       time% maxmem  cpu%  dbcache\r\nbench-ssd-2  bench/au.1               9:24:53    0.92  6717.99MB 338%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-2  bench/au.1               9:23:14    0.92  6770.57MB 339%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-2  bench/au.master.1        10:08:33   0.99  6654.39MB 315%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-2  bench/au.master.1        10:13:04   1.00  6697.26MB 313%  5000MB\r\n\r\nbench-ssd-3  bench/au.master.1        9:26:17    0.93  6743.38MB 337%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-3  bench/au.master.1        9:24:03    0.93  6748.67MB 338%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-3  bench/au.1               9:22:35    0.92  6713.50MB 340%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-3  bench/au.1               10:08:36   1.00  6712.88MB 314%  5000MB\r\n\r\nbench-ssd-4  bench/au.1               9:24:59    0.93  6744.43MB 338%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-4  bench/au.1               10:06:09   1.00  6717.30MB 315%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-4  bench/au.master.1        9:23:44    0.93  6695.61MB 339%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-4  bench/au.master.1        9:23:56    0.93  6646.16MB 338%  5000MB\r\n\r\nbench-ssd-5  bench/au.master.1        9:18:57    1.00  6715.23MB 341%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-5  bench/au.master.1        9:20:35    1.00  6644.22MB 341%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-5  bench/au.1               9:17:27    0.99  6702.63MB 342%  5000MB\r\nbench-ssd-5  bench/au.1               9:21:17    1.00  6663.15MB 340%  5000MB\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote of course that as a sort of \"meta\"-optimization, these benchmarks are solely to ensure that we haven't introduced any performance regressions into normal operation. The really relevant benchmark here is \"time from empty datadir to usable node,\" which on one of my more capable machines has gone from ~20hrs to ~1hr. \r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\n\r\nIf you want to help move this project forward, the following PRs are prerequisites and once they're merged I'll carve off the next changeset:\r\n\r\n- #16945 \r\n- #17487 \r\n\r\n### Current work\r\n\r\nAfter significantly revising the structure of the snapshot file in #16899, this branch has been substantially rebased to avoid the requirement of any on-disk snapshot metadata once the snapshot has been loaded; instead we look to filesystem state (the presence of a `$DATADIR/chainstate_*` folder) to signal that we are currently building a snapshot chainstate. Once this chainstate has been fully back validated, we move it over to the regular `chainstate/` dir on shutdown. We also used to need on-disk state to restore the \"faked\" `nChainTx` data for snapshot-based header chains -- we now cache that information in the snapshot's chainstate itself (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/87093a94ba311c495a1982f4f47d0c4607789f8f).\r\n\r\nI'm currently thinking about how to handle locking semantics (as you might be able to tell from the last commit, which needs to be squashed into the rest of the history at some point) which I can detail further if anyone's interested.",

      "body": "Quick update. I've rebased this PR in such a way that it does not rely on changes in #17487 to avoid being blocked on that going through. If that does merge, it'll be easy to update this branch to make use of the flush-without-erase behavior.\r\n\r\nThis needs testing (which I plan to do soon) as it's been a while since I've gone through the whole battery of manual system tests (i.e. actually loading snapshots and syncing). I need to focus on writing a few more functional and unit tests that will obviate most of that manual work. Some intermediate commits here almost certainly have compilation errors.\r\n\r\nThis project is getting to the point where it's less straightforward to find discrete bits of this draft to carve off for individual merge. Among the next changes are the snapshot activation procedure, the related RPC command for loading a snapshot, and all the little correspondent changes that have to happen in modules like net_processing to have snapshot chainstates actually function. I guess it makes sense to PR the snapshot activation changes (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/eae9c625b10a7b5e6495ebef8698a98873f4933a) individually, but after that it may be somewhat less straightforward to carve off commits. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering how averse people would be to treating much of the remainder of this draft as a single PR, and subsequently finishing off the first phase of assumeutxo in two or so more PRs?",

I could also imagine a different approach thats splits out the tweaky commits as small obvious 1-commit PRs that could be reviewed in parallel, but this might just be more work and not solve anything.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world it would be nice if individual changes here could be accompanied by unit tests confirming the new behaviors, but understandable that this isn't happening since validation code is not very modular.",

      "body": "Thanks for testing @Sjors. I couldn't reproduce your bug, but during manual testing I did find a number of issues based upon changes that have happened since last rebase. Subsequently I've pushed a bunch of new commits, some of which need to be fixed up. I've also done a manual test of the assumeutxo workflow and everything seems to be working properly again. \r\n\r\nI also found an issue, possibly new but possibly not, related to restarting bitcoind while using a snapshot that has not yet been fully validated. Basically, faked `nTx` values were not persisting and so `LoadBlockIndex()` was failing due to not constructing `setBlockIndexCandidates` as expected. \r\n\r\nIn response to the this as well as the recent changes in `RewindBlockIndex`, I've decided to make a change consistent with a previous recommendation from @ryanofsky: instead of mutating \"fake\" data into the block index for assumed-valid blocks, I'm instead explicitly accounting for the possibility of snapshot use at usage sites (e.g. `LoadBlockIndex()`, `NeedsRedownload()`). I think this is easier to reason about instead of relying on some implicit data faking.\r\n\r\n### Manual testing\r\n\r\nI've generated a snapshot at 685000 using the `utxo_snapshot.sh` contrib script.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsrc/bitcoin (? utxo-dumpload-compressed 4dfd3a2) % /usr/bin/time ./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh 685000 utxo-685.dat ./src/bitcoin-cli\r\nRewinding chain back to height 685000 (by invalidating 00000000000000000002091619d7ae1596349afb10fe8cb1833a09945db1180d); this may take a while\r\nGenerating UTXO snapshot...\r\n{\r\n  \"coins_written\": 75696073,\r\n  \"base_hash\": \"000000000000000000043a68d9e09f48eeb485ac28bde0abb6e0b6cb6e726a21\",\r\n  \"base_height\": 685000,\r\n  \"path\": \"/home/james/.bitcoin/utxo-685.dat\",\r\n  \"assumeutxo\": \"a85dd26a5ca449d76bc7cb6103960a2894475f11acef57efb77d833ca84d0ed3\",\r\n  \"nchaintx\": 644907744\r\n}\r\nRestoring chain to original height; this may take a while\r\n0.01user 0.00system 14:13.84elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 4712maxresident)k\r\n2688inputs+0outputs (22major+1584minor)pagefaults 0swaps\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then create a new datadir (`~/.bitcoin/utxo-test`), start up, and immediately load the snapshot:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsrc/bitcoin (? utxo-dumpload-compressed 4dfd3a2) % /usr/bin/time ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=/home/james/.bitcoin/utxo-test loadtxoutset ~/.bitcoin/utxo-685.dat\r\n{\r\n  \"coins_loaded\": 75696073,\r\n  \"tip_hash\": \"000000000000000000043a68d9e09f48eeb485ac28bde0abb6e0b6cb6e726a21\",\r\n  \"base_height\": 685000,\r\n  \"path\": \"/home/james/.bitcoin/utxo-685.dat\"\r\n}\r\n0.00user 0.00system 12:49.51elapsed 0%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 4348maxresident)k\r\n3536inputs+0outputs (18major+233minor)pagefaults 0swaps\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter load, I verified that the snapshot chain successfully syncs to tip, caches rebalance accordingly, and background validation starts. I also verified that the snapshot tip is maintained without issue as new blocks come in.\r\n\r\n### Next\r\n\r\nFunctional tests will be added to this branch. I may also add a contrib script that makes \"demoing\" the assumeutxo workflow more straightforward.\r\n",

The script itself involves creating a snapshot, modifying the chainparams, and then watching the snapshot-based sync process followed by background validation. It's also a happy-path test of the changes here. I hope others find it useful, even if it just ends up being an ephemeral thing for testing that is never merged.",

      "body": "Thanks for the helpful commentary @ryanofsky and thanks for the testing @Sjors.\r\n\r\nI've pushed a cleanup rebase that addresses some of your comments, slims the commit count down to 30 (from 37), and reorders the commits to be closer to the order I anticipate they'll be merged in. I understand some explication is required on things like indexation and P2P processing, and I'll include that in the constituent PRs.\r\n\r\nThis branch is now close to something resembling mergeability, though of course that's not my expectation. I'm somewhat concerned with the pace of this project (although extenuating circumstances like taproot not to mention my own (in)ability to keep up with this work over the last year provide some explanation). \r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm going to try a different tack here and open a bunch of smallish, independently mergeable PRs containing some of the commits here that shouldn't change any behavior until multi-chainstate use actually becomes possible (i.e. with the merge of the `loadtxoutset` PR which is intentionally towards the back of the queue).\r\n\r\nThanks again to everyone for their help and patience on this project. Some of the code here was written 2 years ago for the bare purpose of coming up with a proof of concept and has been dragged along through many rebases, so everyone's participation here helping to shape up and vet this code is very much appreciated on my end.",

      "body": "Going through the changes in this PR, they seem reasonable, but not as straightforward as they could be. IMO, with a modest reworking, the assumeutxo logic could be better encapsulated and implemented in ChainStateManager without adding as many special cases in validation and other code.\r\n\r\nThe change I'd suggest would be to drop all the ChainStateManager `m_*_chainstate` members and just have a plain list of chainstates: `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<CChainState>> m_chainstates`, and change each chainstate `CTxMemPool& m_mempool` reference member to a `CTxMemPool* m_mempool` pointer member which is non-null for the active chainstate, null for any other chainstates. Validation code would loop over chainstates and update the mempool when it's non-null, skip it when it's null, send a `BackgroundBlockConnected` notification if it's null or `BlockConnected` if non-null, etc.\r\n\r\nThis would also allow;\r\n  \r\n- Dropping a lot of assumeutxo jargon. I still get \"IBD chainstate\" \"Snapshot chainstate\" \"Active chainstate\" \"Background IBD chainstate\" \"Validated chainstate\" confused and have to think about what they mean each time I see them in context. The current distinctions between \"valid\" and \"validated\" (valid by assumption vs validated by downloading blocks in the background) also seem unnecessarily opaque. These definitions seem unneeded if the assumeutxo implementation is confined to `ChainStateManager` and the assumeutxo RPC methods, and the rest of the code can just loop over chainstates treating them the same and just skipping some work if `m_mempool` is null.\r\n\r\n- More straightforward approach to pruning. Instead of having to write special case pruning logic, this could be integrated with #21726, and each chainstate could just add to a list of prune blockers (ranges of blocks not allowed to be pruned) and pruning code would not need to be aware of assumeutxo states.\r\n\r\n- Keeping future code maintainable and having confidence in completeness of the change. Fact that assumeutxo implementation is not well encapsulated now makes it hard to be confident that the long list of assumeutxo special cases in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606#issuecomment-868553822 is actually complete, and that special cases added now won't break in the future if there are assumeutxo changes later",

      "body": "Russ, thanks for the thorough and thoughtful look here. Really appreciate your design guidance.\r\n\r\nOf course I have the predictable grumbles about the rework necessary and a slight dread at the prospect of introducing more prerequisite refactoring (given this project has been ongoing for two years already), but on design questions like this I'm inclined to side with you given (i) this code began as a minimum-viable demo prototype, and (ii) I've been staring at it for too damn long to be objective.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but one of the motivating factors behind your suggestion here is the notion that we may one day be facilitating `n` background chainstates instead of just 1, at which point some rework would be required to fix the abstractions for that case. Indeed the utreexo project that @kcalvinalvin @adiabat et al. have been working on may introduce such a usage.\r\n\r\nJust a few potshot responses before really gauging the level of effort required to make the changes you're talking about:\r\n\r\n> HasMempool vs IsActiveChain\r\n\r\nOne pushback I might have is that a lot of the \"inline\" logic that's scattered throughout parts of validation and net_processing won't actually by simplified by relatively surface-level transformations of `== ActiveChainstate()` -> `HasMempool()`. In some cases switching behavior on mempool presence might be even more confusing (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/b51d6d7a30bc6c9bd0a63549254156ae3aeb6d4a) since the mempool is basically unrelated to things like validationinterface callbacks. But maybe making that change for cases where the mempool is relevant might make sense and be pretty easy (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606/commits/70395ccedafd54fda2bc2e634e631935f5f1cec3).\r\n\r\nFundamentally a lot of the validation/net logic just needs to know whether it's dealing with the active chainstate or not; I don't see a way around that short of moving a maybe-inappropriate amount of domain-specific code into the ChainstateManager. \r\n\r\n> supporting `n` chainstates\r\n\r\nIf our goal is to facilitate `n` background chainstates instead of just 1 (although maybe your goal is purely to make the code easier to follow?), my inclination would be to say that we should wait until we're actually looking to implement `n` chainstates before spending a bunch of time on design changes.\r\n\r\nOn list-of-chainstates vs. `m_ibd_chainstate` and `m_snapshot_chainstate`, these are private members  of chainman and so swapping them out for a list (when necessary) should be pretty easily doable. But until we have actual use for a list, doing such a refactoring would kind of make awkward [things like cache rebalancing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7317e14a44c6efc545e6fb9bcedee7174e93a8fa/src/validation.cpp#L5055-L5083). I guess that could be rephrased in terms of more general math... but why introduce the generality before we need it?\r\n\r\n> instead of having to write special case pruning logic, this could be integrated with Improve Indices on pruned nodes via prune blockers #21726, and each chainstate could just add to a list of prune blockers\r\n\r\nCan we not do this under the current design? I don't see why the suggested design changes would enable or simplify this, but admittedly I haven't given that work a close look yet.\r\n\r\n> Keeping future code maintainable and having confidence in completeness of the change.\r\n\r\nI think the reality is that introducing the possibility of multiple chainstates is a huge overhaul to the system and there's no free lunch in terms of simplification. Unless we move a lot of domain-specific code into the chainman, we're not going to get around some degree of scatter. I think in either case, you're not going to be able to verify completeness without grepping for every `CChainState` usage and manually examining it; I don't think there's a way around this regardless of the design you choose.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGrumbles aside I will spend the next few days trying to implement your proposed changes in an alternate branch. If the diff is small enough and I get your sign-off on completeness, I'll replace HEAD here.",

So definitely feel free to any skip extra implementation work unless you think it will actually improve things.\r\n\r\nBut just to clarify, supporting multiple background chainstates was not my motivation at all. (I did try to think of use cases for multiple chainstates but couldn't think of any that seemed very realistic.) My motivation was purely to make resulting code more understandable and maintainable. I think ideally assumeutxo phases would be encapsulated completely in the ChainstateManager class and not referenced in any other validation code, including ChainState methods. I think outside of ChainstateManager no other validation code that should have to know about the \"IBD chainstate\" \"Snapshot chainstate\" \"Active chainstate\" \"Background IBD chainstate\" or\"Validated chainstate\". The jargon still just blurs together for me. I think ideally validation code should just deal with chains and blocks based on their attributes, not based on assumeutxo stages or the global sync state. Things just seem less confusing and more reassuring that way (more reassuring because special cases are less special and because background chainstates don't have access to the mempool).",

      "body": "> In some cases switching behavior on mempool presence might be even more confusing (e.g. [b51d6d7](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b51d6d7a30bc6c9bd0a63549254156ae3aeb6d4a)) since the mempool is basically unrelated to things like validationinterface callbacks.\r\n\r\nThis is probably subjective, but I don't see it as being unrelated. If the chain is connected to the mempool it's active, and `BlockConnected` should be called instead of `BackgroundBlockConnected`, and rewinds and disconnects are possible instead of impossible, and other notifications should be sent too. \r\n\r\n> Fundamentally a lot of the validation/net logic just needs to know whether it's dealing with the active chainstate or not;\r\n\r\nThere could be `bool IsBackground() const { return m_mempool == nullptr; }` or  `bool IsActive() const { return m_mempool != nullptr; }` helpers maybe. I tend to not like vocabulary-introducing things like this, because then you have the mental overhead of putting cases into a taxonomy instead of just making all the code handle all the cases. But this is very subjective.\r\n\r\n> I don't see a way around that short of moving a maybe-inappropriate amount of domain-specific code into the ChainstateManager.\r\n\r\nI'm actually not sure what this would be referring to.\r\n\r\n> On list-of-chainstates vs. `m_ibd_chainstate` and `m_snapshot_chainstate`, these are private members of chainman and so swapping them out for a list (when necessary) should be pretty easily doable. But until we have actual use for a list, doing such a refactoring would kind of make awkward [things like cache rebalancing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7317e14a44c6efc545e6fb9bcedee7174e93a8fa/src/validation.cpp#L5055-L5083). I guess that could be rephrased in terms of more general math... but why introduce the generality before we need it?\r\n\r\nFunny, it seems to me more general, less hardcoded math would actually be simpler to understand. Take the cache, divide it up, maybe boost some chain's weighting (I forget already) by some factor based on it's attributes. No thinking about assumeutxo phases or terminology.\r\n\r\n> > instead of having to write special case pruning logic, this could be integrated with Improve Indices on pruned nodes via prune blockers #21726, and each chainstate could just add to a list of prune blockers\r\n> \r\n> Can we not do this under the current design? I don't see why the suggested design changes would enable or simplify this, but admittedly I haven't given that work a close look yet.\r\n\r\nYes this would be doable under current design. I just mentioned it because it would be optional under current design, but required under the suggested design (because pruning code wouldn't know about the types of chainstates, it would just have to treat them generically and ask what blocks they need to keep).\r\n\r\n> > Keeping future code maintainable and having confidence in completeness of the change.\r\n> \r\n> I think the reality is that introducing the possibility of multiple chainstates is a huge overhaul to the system and there's no free lunch in terms of simplification. Unless we move a lot of domain-specific code into the chainman, we're not going to get around some degree of scatter.\r\n\r\nI don't think I'm suggesting to move any large pieces of code, but yes I do think ChainstateManager would be a little more complex because it would be more responsible for setting up and updating attributes of the chains so other validation code doesn't have to know about assumeutxo. I think this is just how things go with encapsulation. You don't necessarily reduce complexity, but you try locate it in one place.\r\n\r\nAgain though everything here is a suggestion and you will have a much better idea of this stuff than me. I'll take a look at the new branch, and I'm happy to review anything.",

Need to review in more detail but the change really seems like it is getting small & manageable.\r\n\r\nMaybe can remove [experimental] tag? I think I saw a minor todo comment or two in net processing code, but otherwise it seems like there is not very much uncertain or left to be resolved here, unless I'm missing something.\r\n\r\nIt could also be good to update the PR description, and because it seems like it is referencing changes that have already been made in prior PRs. You could just mention the PR numbers and say the text describes the combined changes.\r\n",

      "body": "As always, thanks for testing @Sjors. We've discussed on IRC, but just so others can follow along: what's happened here is you've listed the blockhash in your chainparams (`0x00000000000000000003f5acb5ec81df7c98c16bc8d89bdaadd4e8965729c018`) instead of the UTXO set hash (`0x2f47dc1e089b623a4bea57e0752b776df9e6885904d7ff8b14911b94c2208ff4`), and so consequently snapshot activation fails. You might have mistaken regular IBD for a snapshot sync-to-tip.\r\n\r\nHowever in doing this, you've uncovered a minor bug: if a snapshot fails to validate, it doesn't activate but it does leave its datadir in place. On next startup, init would try to load this snapshot chainstate on the basis of the datadir existence but, because it was never actually activated, blockindex assertions don't allow the load to happen. This error would have only occurred in practice if a user is given a malformed snapshot file or is manually tweaking chainparams values, as we are here.\r\n\r\nI've pushed a commit ensuring that teardown of the snapshot datadir happens should activation fail. An alternative to this would be setting some kind of block index state that controls snapshot load on startup, but I don't think that's necessary. \r\n\r\nThe correct chainparams modification for the snapshot you generated is\r\n```cpp\r\n        m_assumeutxo_data = MapAssumeutxo{\r\n            ...\r\n            {\r\n                694000,\r\n                {AssumeutxoHash{uint256S(\"0x2f47dc1e089b623a4bea57e0752b776df9e6885904d7ff8b14911b94c2208ff4\")}, 659945001},\r\n            },\r\n        };\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tested syncing to network tip with the 694000 snapshot, shutting down and booting back up at various points during the process, and it works for me. Thanks again for testing and finding bugs!",

      "body": "CI trips over:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/validation.cpp:5721:1: \r\nerror: \r\nreturn type 'const ChainstateRole' is 'const'-qualified at the top level, which may reduce code readability without improving const correctness [readability-const-return-type,-warnings-as-errors]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI made a snapshot at height 780,000 and then loaded it.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Oops...</summary>\r\n But instead of finishing towards the tip, it started the background sync:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"height\": 780050,\r\n    \"hash\": \"000000000000000000043cfdd430cbcf5d6cfa0c437ad5b808e1d45dc509387e\",\r\n    \"branchlen\": 771607,\r\n    \"status\": \"headers-only\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"height\": 8443,\r\n    \"hash\": \"00000000ee985adaa7242745800b7702d48558fbc517358be4fb597368f8b217\",\r\n    \"branchlen\": 0,\r\n    \"status\": \"active\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is because the assume valid block was (unrealistically) close to the tip?\r\n\r\nI used the commits in this PR, but cleanly rebased on #24008 (replacing the first 6 commits here), and with a commit to modify the assumed valid block.\r\n\r\nI was able to produce this behaviour with a fresh datadir.\r\n\r\n_Update 10-3-2023_: I just tried again and noticed a log message that I probably overlooked: `[snapshot] bad snapshot content hash …`. This ~puzzling too, since I got the same sha256 hash when dumping the snapshot on both macOS and Ubuntu~ the umpteenth time I hardcoded a block hash instead of the content hash, ~but~ and it explains why IBD just went on as normal.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nIt made it to the tip and is now doing a background sync.\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed if that whenc syncing to the tip, it was showing `cache=3.0MiB` even though it was using ~15GB of ~cache~ RAM. This is strange, because #27008 is not part of this PR, so most of the RAM should have cleared up once the snapshot is loaded.\r\n\r\n~Also worrying is that~ once it reaches the tip, it doesn't immediately flush. (Update: that makes sense, because we recently flushed.) That causes the background sync to have very limited resources. It endup up flushing the cache when it reach 1751MB (which matches the coinstip cache of 818 MB plus my maxmempool of 1GB). (update: I think the problem is that it's not correctly rebalancing)\r\n\r\nStrangely it says `[snapshot] validated snapshot (811 MB)` and `[snapshot] (811 MB)`, which seems completely off since the snapshot should use about 12 GB (`-dbcache` was set high enough).\r\n\r\nOnce I restart the node it creates a more reasonable split between the background ibd (15555 MB) and snapshot chainstate caches (818 MB).\r\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed is that because it takes a while to load and process the snapshot, it triggers a timeout in p2p networking and we start querying DNS seeds again. Can be dealt with in a followup.\r\n\r\nLoading a wallet that last opened _before_ the assumevalid block fails gracefully, with a clear instruction to try again after sync reaches the snapshot height. Currently the GUI gives no indication that such a background sync is going on, but that's ok for now. The user must have used the RPC to trigger snapshot use, and loading an old wallet on fresh node is not a typical novice use case.",

      "body": "Alright! This is fully rebased and passing CI. Copy/pasteable testing instructions follow.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure these are the complete changes necessary to enable use of assumeutxo (via `loadtxoutset`), including pruning and index use. It's worth noting that 200 of these lines are an elaborate demo shell script and another good chunk of this is airy RPC code, so this 1200 line diff is maybe more approachable than it appears.\r\n\r\n### Recent changes\r\n\r\n- [x] I've segmented blockfile storage into \"assumed\" vs. \"normal\" files to avoid doing drastic mixing of heights. As the code was written, we had snapshot and ibd chainstates pushing into the same space of blockfiles, which makes pruning ineffectual for a decent chunk of the chain. This is now fixed.\r\n- [x] Ironed out all the indexing issues in a relatively simple way. Indexation now happens strictly sequentially, along the background chainstate (which is just a continuation of the \"regular\" chainstate that we initialize with before running `loadtxoutset` and creating the snapshot chainstate). Validationinterface events in the indexers are ignored for the snapshot chainstate; once we complete background validation, the indexers are restarted and continue (sequentially) into the previously unindexed region of the chain.\r\n- [x] I've renamed `monitorsnapshot` (a utility RPC) to `getchainstates`.\r\n- [x] Lotta rebase and bug fixes.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### For fun (~5min)\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a quick test, you can run `./contrib/devtools/test_utxo_snapshots.sh` and follow the instructions. This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (https://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl https://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\nHave fun and hope it works!\r\n\r\n#### Known weird behavior\r\n\r\n- [ ] The last few blocks to get the snapshot chainstate to tip seem to take a while to roll in... I'm not sure what's going on here. It eventually syncs, but not as fast as I would think.\r\n- [x] If you restart the node in the middle of the bg sync, `nChainTx` for the snapshot chain will not properly repopulate and your `progress=` for the snapshot chainstate will be weird. I *think* there's an easy fix for this, which I'm investigating.\r\n\r\n#### Next steps\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll open a PR that's this changeset but without the pruning changes, as suggested by @sdaftuar. If we decide it's preferable to wait on pruning we can, but I think the LOC delta is only maybe a hundred lines or so. Conceptually the diff might be bigger of course. Curious what others think here, given this (relatively complete?) set of changes.",

I get that BlockMetadataManager is a singleton shared between multiple chainstates, but I think it's a mistake to add global references to it all over the code. If you could add a `BlockMetadataManager& m_blockmetaman` member to CChainState (also needs forward declaration and initialization in constructor), and replace \r\n`g_blockmetaman` with `m_blockmetaman` where possible, I think it would help make relationship between the classes clearer, and also be a step in the direction of making validation code more testable and possible to break apart.",

But that doesn't work where truthy is used later in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/8d9b707f609b647fb28ae182a097adc03e718725#diff-349fbb003d5ae550a2e8fa658e475880R777. Since this is C++, it would probably be clearer to say \"non-zero\" here and \"non-null\" there, if that's what is meant.",

I'm not sure if jimpo intended this to happen when he wrote it, but because `m_chain` has no entries the latch flips immediately. So the above discussion is not moot, and this (maybe surprising) behavior should probably be documented in `BaseIndex`. I may do that in a separate PR soon.",

When you've got two separate chainstates throwing off BlockConnected events, you basically have to reserve updating that pointer for the background chainstate because otherwise you're breaking the nature of the best block pointer. Updating the index when you get an assumed-valid chainstate event would mean that there are unindexed blocks beneath the pointer.\r\n\r\nI've tried to think about ways to avoid this situation, but haven't been able to figure out anything simpler. If you've got ideas, I'm definitely curious and happy to implement.",
