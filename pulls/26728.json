    "body": "The wallet currently does not know the master key that was used to generate the automatically generated descriptors. This makes it difficult to add new automatically generated descriptors when new ones are introduced. So instead of losing this information after the descriptors are created, have `CWallet` store it. The xpub will be stored in a new `activehdkey` field. The private key must be one of the keys that is used by the descriptors, and will be extracted upon loading.\r\n\r\nAs this is a new field, wallets will be automatically upgraded upon loading. This loading is backwards compatible and uses a new non-required flag `WALLET_FLAG_GLOBAL_HD_KEY` to signal that the upgrade completed. The upgrade will search for an xpub that is shared by `pkh()`, `wpkh()`, and `sh(wpkh()` descriptors with the derivation pattern that we use. For new wallets, the xpub will be set during descriptor creation rather than trying to reverse engineer it. The flag will be set for all wallets, regardless of whether such an xpub was found or can even exist, in order to indicate that the upgrade will not need to be run in the future.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to have a `gethdkey` command which is useful for those who need a simple way to get an xpub from a wallet. `gethdkey` can also take a boolean parameter to indicate whether it should also output the corresponding xprv.\r\n\r\nSupercedes #23417",

The conclusion was that we could not think of a use case for key rotation that is not sufficiently covered by creating a new wallet.\r\n\r\nSince this PR does not introduce the ability for users to explicitly rotate keys, I don't think there's anything to change to meet this conclusion. Those updates will be in #25907.\r\n\r\nIt's currently possible to rotate keys by encrypting the wallet. Since this is a longstanding behavior that has several tests expecting this behavior, I've decided to leave it in. Removing this behavior has more issues than not introducing explicit key rotation in descriptor wallets. So I've decided to leave the PR as is.",

What do you think we should do in the following situation?\r\n\r\n- Create a blank wallet with master branch\r\n- import 6 descriptors derived from the same key. `WALLET_FLAG_GLOBAL_HD_KEY` is not set and no master key \r\n- `getxpub` reports \"This wallet does not have an active xpub\"\r\n- reload the wallet. Upgrade code is triggered, it sets the flag and the master key\r\n\r\nThis will become even more confusing when/if we later introduce `addedseed` and/or `manual` wallets. I think it's better to reduce the amount of magic and only trigger upgrades for wallets created with older versions. Maybe we can set `WALLET_FLAG_GLOBAL_HD_KEY` for all new wallets even those that are blank?",

Later we want to add a separate method to change HD key anyway to cover that use case.\r\n",

Later we want to add a separate method to change HD key anyway to cover that use case.\r\n\r\nI thought this was doing this already, but it turns out that we don't set the descriptor flag until after the upgrade stuff is run for creation, so it wasn't being set. I've added a commit which will set the flag for all new wallets.",

Loading things on demand from the database is orthogonal to this PR, and when implementing that, it should be done almost all at once, not piecemeal. I'm concerned that a piecemeal approach would result in developers missing that some data is in fact stored on disk and could be read, which could lead to further duplication and confusion when working on the wallet.\r\n\r\n> And the second is whether we really want to store these private keys 9 times, see inline comment.\r\n\r\nIt's done for backwards compatibility reasons. Without storing the master key for each descriptor, a wallet would not be able to be opened in an older version of the software.",

For blank wallets `gehdkey` fails due to Assume in GetActiveHDKey\r\n\r\nFixed.\r\n\r\n> 2\\. create wallet in the feature branch, downgrade to master, encrypt wallet, upgrade to feature branch again. The wallet will fai to load because it now contains both encrypted and non-encrypted records.\r\n\r\nThis is slightly problematic since we don't want to automatically upgrade a wallet in a way that prevents downgrading. I've changed the approach in this PR to only store the active xpub. The private keys will instead be retrieved from the descriptors during loading and stored in memory in the wallet, so there is no longer `hdkey` or `hdckey` records. This should resolve the downgrading issue while retaining most of the functionality of this PR.\r\n\r\nThis does mean that key rotation as had been previously implemented is no longer easy to do.",

      "body": "> But I don't think I understand the reason for adding a new flag to indicate the presence of an ACTIVEHDKEY record, when it seems like code would be simpler and more reliable just handling absence of the record as necessary. It would be helpful if PR description mentioned the reason for adding a new flag and whether it's actually needed or just desired for some other reason.\r\n\r\nThe description currently states:\r\n\r\n> This loading is backwards compatible and uses a new non-required flag `WALLET_FLAG_GLOBAL_HD_KEY` to signal that the upgrade completed. The upgrade will search for an xpub that is shared by `pkh()`, `wpkh()`, and `sh(wpkh()` descriptors with the derivation pattern that we use. For new wallets, the xpub will be set during descriptor creation rather than trying to reverse engineer it. The flag will be set for all wallets, regardless of whether such an xpub was found or can even exist, in order to indicate that the upgrade will not need to be run in the future.\r\n\r\nBasically the point is to signal that the upgrade is done so we don't do it every time a wallet starts. An important point is that `ACTIVEHDKEY` does not need to exist after the upgrade was done.",

      "body": "Repeated my manual tests, all works.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I want to clarify is the downgrade + encrypt situation. So now the wallet loads and not \"corrupted\" but if the user would generate new descriptors (as proposed in future PRs) the wallet will use the pre-encryption HD key. The scenario seems pretty rare, but still slightly concerning as the pre-encryption HD key could've been compromised.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should consider only loading key from active descriptors? In this case the wallet will \"loose\" its HD key, but the behaviour is more safe.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to do the upgrade on every load, but that seems like a worse alternative to me given the scenario should be pretty rare.",

      "body": "> I've changed the approach in this PR to only store the active xpub. The private keys will instead be retrieved from the descriptors during loading and stored in memory in the wallet, so there is no longer `hdkey` or `hdckey` records.\r\n\r\nAs much as I don't like having to go through half the PR again, I do think this is a nice simplification.\r\n\r\n@furszy without key rotation* the only thing that can be done with older descriptor wallets is add the missing taproot descriptor (and future descriptor types). These would then use the old unencrypted master key, which is indeed not good.\r\n\r\nOne solution could be for the `createwalletdescriptor` (proposed in #26728) to explicitly check for this scenario. Before creating a descriptor it could check that at least one of the active descriptors derives from `activehdkey`.\r\n\r\nIf not, it could tell the user to run the wallet tool, where we could add a method that removes the `activehdkey` and redo the migration (atomically, so only if that actually works).\r\n\r\n`* =` in #26728 as it's currently proposed, using key rotation adds a wallet flag that prevents any downgrade.

Does it make sense for sethdseed RPC to be supported? ~Assume the answer to these is no, but I'm not clear on why.~ I think it probably would make sense to say in the migratewallet documentation how these things map over from legacy to descriptor wallets\r\n\r\nEDIT: `sethdseed` for descriptor wallets is actually implemented in #23544, so answer to that question is yes",

      "body": "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#discussion_r1419188377\r\n\r\n> Activeness of descriptors does not necessarily correlate to the hdkey. The user could have imported new active descriptors with different keys and the hdkey would not change.\r\n\r\nLooking at related PRs which will build on this one, this approach seems increasingly kludgy to me.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me wallet usability will be worse and behavior is more confusing if:\r\n\r\n- the active hd key (seed)\r\n- the active set of descriptors\r\n\r\nare separate things that are stored independently and are used for different purposes.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better not to introduce the concept of an \"active hd key\" at all, and instead follow an approach more like what apoelstra implemented in #27351 where a hd seed is just extra information associated with a descriptor, and different descriptors can have different seeds.\r\n\r\nI think it is useful to have a `gethdkey` method similar to the one added here that would return the hd key associated with various descriptors. But that could be implemented more simply without changing the database format, or adding a flag, or bringing in other complexity introduced in this PR.\r\n\r\nI also think the `sethdseed` RPC should be extended to work with descriptor wallets like in #29054 to make it easy to bring in seeds and work for applications like #27351. But I think the proposed `sethdseed` implementation in #29054 which adds an active hd seed that \"will only be used for new automatically generated descriptors\" going forward is unnecessarily confusing. It would seem more straightforward for the RPC to add the HD key to the wallet and optionally generate new descriptors as a one-time event, without setting an \"active\" seed which is independent from the active descriptors and could become irrelevant if new descriptors are imported.\r\n\r\nI also think the `createwalletdescriptor` RPC from #25907 should be added to make it easy to upgrade wallets when new address types are added. But this could work the same way as `gethdkey` and use the HD key already in the wallet, or allow one to be specified if there are multiple.\r\n\r\nI also think `importdescriptor` logic Sjors added in #23544 to support #24861 which builds on `GetActiveHDKey` from this PR seems very useful. But it seems unnecessarily fragile for it to be based on this. If you are trying to derive private keys associated with an imported descriptor, why should you care whether the seed is \"active\" or not? It seems like it would be more reliable just to work as whenever the seed is present.\r\n\r\nBasically in all these cases it seems like adding the concept of an \"active hd key\" makes using and understanding the wallet more complicated, and also makes the implementation more complicated than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nI have not been following discussion around these topics very long, and I'm probably mistaken about of lot of things, it just seems to me like we should be able to get all of the benefits of this PR without the complexity.",

      "body": "> I think it would be better not to introduce the concept of an \"active hd key\" at all, and instead follow an approach more like what apoelstra implemented in #27351 where a hd seed is just extra information associated with a descriptor, and different descriptors can have different seeds.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially what we do today, albeit with hd keys rather than hd seeds.\r\n\r\n> I think it is useful to have a `gethdkey` method similar to the one added here that would return the hd key associated with various descriptors. But that could be implemented more simply without changing the database format, or adding a flag, or bringing in other complexity introduced in this PR.\r\n\r\nWhat would the API for that look like?\r\n\r\n> I also think the `createwalletdescriptor` RPC from #25907 should be added to make it easy to upgrade wallets when new address types are added. But this could work the same way as `gethdkey` and use the HD key already in the wallet, or allow one to be specified if there are multiple.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the work in this PR is the product of different iterations of how to implement `createwalletdescriptor`. The main thing blocking that is the question of which key should be used in the new descriptors. I've tried a couple of different approaches, and they all have drawbacks in some form:\r\n\r\n* **Generate a new hd key and use that for the descriptor.** Feedback on this was essentially that it would be confusing to users since all other descriptors use the same hd key. It would also make a wallet made in the past inconsistent with the pattern for wallets made today.\r\n* **Have the user provide the hd key.** This really sucks for the user since they need to figure out how to get a hd key. The easiest way is to just pull it out from a descriptor in the same wallet, then we should be smart enough to figure that out for them.\r\n* **Have the user specify a descriptor.** This is basically providing the hd key but worse since descriptors are longer, and it would only work for single key descriptors.\r\n  * **Specify a descriptor id.** While shorter than specifying a full descriptor, it's still not a good UX. The user has to find a descriptor id, and we don't currently expose that info. The descriptor id is also completely opaque and we'd then have to settle on what an id even means.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to provide an answer for this question. Whenever there is more than one hd key, there is a UX problem in how the user is supposed to specify it. So this PR resolves that by picking only one key. Then there is the problem with upgrading. This PR solves that by being consistent with new wallets - new wallets have a master key that is automatically generated and used in all the automatically generated descriptors, so it tries to reverse engineer the hd key from the existing descriptors. Using the automatically generated key means that all wallets, both old and new, should behave consistently.\r\n\r\n> does it make sense for getwalletinfo to start returning an hdseedid value?\r\n\r\nWe can't do that since we're dealing with hd keys rather than hd seeds. The seed is hashed in order to become a master key, and descriptor wallets always throw that away once the master key is computed as it is no longer needed. We wouldn't be able to compute this for old wallets.",

      "body": "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1865160784\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#pullrequestreview-1791595622\r\n\r\n> This is essentially what we do today, albeit with hd keys rather than hd seeds.\r\n\r\nRight. It seems like we can add the features we want without making the wallet data model more complicated, so I think we should do that. If there are features that can't work under the current model, or would work worse under the current model, that would change things, but in all of the cases I've read about it actually looks like the features would work better and be less confusing in the current model compared to the new model.\r\n\r\n> > I think it is useful to have a `gethdkey` method similar to the one added here that would return the hd key associated with various descriptors. But that could be implemented more simply without changing the database format, or adding a flag, or bringing in other complexity introduced in this PR.\r\n> \r\n> What would the API for that look like?\r\n\r\nInstead of returning an object with \"xpub\" and \"xpriv\" fields, it would return a list of objects with \"xpub\", \"xpriv\", and \"descriptors\" fields. The \"descriptors\" field would contain a list of descriptors using the hd key.\r\n\r\nIt would also be good for the method to accept an \"active_only\" option, and only return hd keys associated with active descriptors by default.\r\n\r\nThis would make it easy to get the hd key, and easy to understand how the hd key is referenced by descriptors. In the typical case it would only return 1 hd key, and in more complicated cases it would be easier to understand than the `gethdmethod` in this PR, because it would give you all the information about hd keys, instead of just choosing one hd key and not telling you which descriptors it is associated with.\r\n\r\n> Ultimately, the work in this PR is the product of different iterations of how to implement `createwalletdescriptor`. The main thing blocking that is the question of which key should be used in the new descriptors. I've tried a couple of different approaches, and they all have drawbacks in some form: [...]\r\n\r\nThanks for describing all those approaches. It clarifies a lot, and I agree with all the drawbacks you mentioned for them. The approach I would suggest is making the hd key an optional parameter to `createwalletdescriptor`, and if it is not specified, using the same hd key as other active descriptors. Unless I am misunderstanding something, in normal cases we would expect there to be exactly one hd key. But in cases where there is more than one key, we could choose the active descriptor for the default output type (like `getnewaddress`), or be more conservative and raise an exception asking for an hd key to be specified to disambiguate.\r\n\r\nFor cases where the hd key is specified to `createwalletdescriptor`, I think we would want it to be flexible and accept multiple formats, but accepting \"xpub\" value from `gethdkey` would be an obvious start. It could also accept the xpriv value, or even the seed keys or bytes. If it accepted private keys or seeds, we could treat it as a generalized alternative to `sethdseed`, which would be great because it would simplify usage, and let us deprecate the `sethdseed` method instead of keeping both methods.\r\n\r\n> The goal of this PR is to provide an answer for this question. Whenever there is more than one hd key, there is a UX problem in how the user is supposed to specify it. So this PR resolves that by picking only one key. Then there is the problem with upgrading. This PR solves that by being consistent with new wallets - new wallets have a master key that is automatically generated and used in all the automatically generated descriptors, so it tries to reverse engineer the hd key from the existing descriptors. Using the automatically generated key means that all wallets, both old and new, should behave consistently.\r\n\r\nYeah I appreciate the cleverness of the implementation, and the fact that you actually found a way to add a new field to the database that depends on existing fields, and still allow the wallet to be opened by older software, and magically get the new software to detect whether the existing fields changed to update the new field.\r\n\r\nBut unless I'm missing something (which is possible and maybe likely), I don't actually see how this magic improves the UX. It seems like it only returns less information to the user and makes wallet behavior more opaque in the use-cases I've seen so far.\r\n\r\n> > does it make sense for getwalletinfo to start returning an hdseedid value?\r\n> \r\n> We can't do that since we're dealing with hd keys rather than hd seeds. The seed is hashed in order to become a master key, and descriptor wallets always throw that away once the master key is computed as it is no longer needed. We wouldn't be able to compute this for old wallets.\r\n\r\nWow yeah, I didn't realize descriptor wallets actually generate the seed but then throw it away only keeping the master key. I guess there are pros and cons to that, but it's another topic and mostly unrelated.",

      "body": "> Instead of returning an object with \"xpub\" and \"xpriv\" fields, it would return a list of objects with \"xpub\", \"xpriv\", and \"descriptors\" fields. The \"descriptors\" field would contain a list of descriptors using the hd key.\r\n> \r\n> It would also be good for the method to accept an \"active_only\" option, and only return hd keys associated with active descriptors by default.\r\n> \r\n> This would make it easy to get the hd key, and easy to understand how the hd key is referenced by descriptors. In the typical case it would only return 1 hd key, and in more complicated cases it would be easier to understand than the `gethdmethod` in this PR, because it would give you all the information about hd keys, instead of just choosing one hd key and not telling you which descriptors it is associated with.\r\n> \r\n> The approach I would suggest is making the hd key an optional parameter to `createwalletdescriptor`, and if it is not specified, using the same hd key as other active descriptors. Unless I am misunderstanding something, in normal cases we would expect there to be exactly one hd key. But in cases where there is more than one key, we could choose the active descriptor for the default output type (like `getnewaddress`), or be more conservative and raise an exception asking for an hd key to be specified to disambiguate.\r\n> \r\n> For cases where the hd key is specified to `createwalletdescriptor`, I think we would want it to be flexible and accept multiple formats, but accepting \"xpub\" value from `gethdkey` would be an obvious start. It could also accept the xpriv value, or even the seed keys or bytes. If it accepted private keys or seeds, we could treat it as a generalized alternative to `sethdseed`, which would be great because it would simplify usage, and let us deprecate the `sethdseed` method instead of keeping both methods.\r\n\r\nHmm. I suppose that could be a viable approach. I will experiment with it.\r\n\r\nI know that @Sjors has some ideas for `gethdkey`/`getxpub` but I'm not sure if those are compatible with this proposed approach. Otherwise, it does seem like it would cover the use cases targeted by this PR and it's descendant.",

      "body": "IIUC the approach proposed by @ryanofsky is to basically figure out the key on demand instead of storing it in the DB.\r\n\r\nSo this works for generating tr() descriptors for existing wallets, but it doesn't work that well for #24861. The desired flow is to have a wallet with HD key but without descriptors and then retrieve an xpub to construct multisig descriptor. How would it work if we don't have an HD key associated with the wallet?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, approach proposed in this PR resolves a regression we had with transition to descriptor wallets. In legacy we actually had a proper HD key residing in a wallet. And this is the same thing we want to bring back to descriptors. 1 wallet = 1 HD key. Yes, the matter is complicated by the fact that users can add any other keys they wish, but the model and the default flow are actually pretty straightforward. ",

Hardware wallets would typically derive those from the same master seed, though from our end that ~doesn't~ shouldn't matter; external signer wallets are watch-only. Well, except that we identify the physical device by the fingerprint of its master key.\r\n\r\n@s3rk wrote:\r\n\r\n> The desired flow is to have a wallet with HD key but without descriptors and then retrieve an xpub to construct multisig descriptor. How would it work if we don't have an HD key associated with the wallet?\r\n\r\nIndeed. There's different proposals out there of how to derive keys for a multisig wallet, but I'm mainly thinking of two approaches:\r\n\r\n1. Take an existing wallet with the usual descriptors, pick an unused derivation path (e.g. `m/48'/...`, based on [BIP 48](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0048.mediawiki)) and share that with the other participants. You then import the resulting multisig descriptor.\r\n\r\n2. Create a fresh wallet with only a seed / master key, and no descriptors. Pick any derivation... (same as 1)\r\n\r\nI prefer (2) because I think you shouldn't co-mingle multisig and single sig funds in the same wallet, for privacy reason and because it's potentially confusing. Multisig setups _always_ require a new backup, so if we need to generate a fresh master key that's not a big deal to me.  ",

      "body": "@Sjors and @S3RK, can you help me out by being specific about the flows you have in mind? Like in terms of what RPC calls users will make to do a particular operation? I'm trying to fill in the gaps myself, but in the cases I can think of, it seems like adding the concept of a sticky master key doesn't actually make things simpler, just more opaque and confusing.\r\n\r\nI understand that if you were designing a new wallet model and API, you would both prefer an approach that required all active descriptors to have a single master key, and would take advantage of having that master key to simplify certain things.\r\n\r\nBut I see real drawbacks to usability and code complexity if we are going to try to pretend that the wallet only has an single active hd key while not actually enforcing this. I think you if compare the API implemented in this PR and its followups to the API proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#pullrequestreview-1791999003 I think you would see the same problems and hopefully agree. To be specific:\r\n\r\n- The `gethdkey` method implemented in this PR currently picks one master key used by descriptors, and ignores others that may be present. The proposed `gethdkey` described in [#26728 (review) ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#pullrequestreview-1791999003) would return any hd key that is actively being used to generate addresses in the wallet by default (and would return inactive hd keys with an option) and also list descriptors associated with hd keys. This should be better and less confusing in every case compared to the implementation in this PR which just returns a single hd key with no descriptor information, with the key chosen in a complicated way that is sticky and can't be controlled by the user, even if they import new descriptors and set them to be active.\r\n\r\n- The `createwalletdescriptor` method implemented in [#25907](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25907) and `sethdseed` method added for descriptor wallets in [#29054](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29054) have overlapping functionality and confusing limitations that would be avoided by dropping `sethdseed` and making `createwalletdescriptor` more flexible as described [#26728 (review) ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#pullrequestreview-1791999003).\r\n\r\n- IIUC, the `importdescriptor` extension from [#23544](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23544/commits/7841583080e33f616422464142290f871c31a2e4) to allow importing descriptors with known xpubs seems like it would be more robust and less confusing if it just worked with any xpub in the wallet or any active xpub, instead of only working for the sticky master key and failing with an error about not having private keys which are actually present.\r\n\r\n- IIUC, the `importdescriptor` extension from [#27351](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27351) would also seem to work more smoothly with the suggested approach, because there would be no need for a separate `sethdseed` call, and the descriptor and master key would show up together in `gethdkey` output.\r\n\r\nFor external signing and multisig, I could believe in theory that there are cases that may be more complicated by not having a sticky hd key. But I haven't seen examples of that yet, and don't think it should be hard to come up with them if they exist. Also I wouldn't want to make the wallet model more complicated prematurely if it seems like all the improvements we want to make are possible without this.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1865817132\r\n\r\n> it doesn't work that well for #24861. The desired flow is to have a wallet with HD key but without descriptors and then retrieve an xpub to construct multisig descriptor. How would it work if we don't have an HD key associated with the wallet?\r\n\r\nThis flow actually sounds more complicated than what I would expect. If you have a blank wallet, why would you want creating a multisig desriptor and creating the hd key to be two separate steps, and require a separate `sethdseed` call before whatever call is used to add the multisig descriptor? Wouldn't the flow be simpler if you just made one call to `createwalletdescriptor` or `importdescriptor` and it did both things? (__EDIT__: Actually rereading this, I can see why this wouldn't work because when you have multiple wallets you need to generate all the seeds first before you can generate the descriptor. I'm still not sure that requires all the complexity in this PR, but it does suggest why it is there.)  In the case of a non-blank wallet, I also think not having a sticky hd key would be more transparent. Creating a multisig desciptor in that case could use the wallet's one hd key if there is one or require one to be specified if there are multiple.\r\n\r\n> In my opinion, approach proposed in this PR resolves a regression we had with transition to descriptor wallets. In legacy we actually had a proper HD key residing in a wallet.\r\n\r\nYes I can see the aspiration to do this, and I could imagine a different wallet model with a less flexible `importdescriptor` RPC that required all descriptor to have the same hd key, or required any descriptors with different hd keys to be inactive. But this is not the current wallet model we have, and it seems like at this point trying to bolt on the concept of a having one hd key when wallet doesn't actually enforce it just seems messy and possibly the worst of both worlds.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#issuecomment-1865915848\r\n\r\n> Something I still need to do, but waiting for this PR to land, is to enable adding a tr() to a external signer wallet. Hardware wallets would typically derive those from the same master seed, though from our end that doesn't shouldn't matter; external signer wallets are watch-only. Well, except that we identify the physical device by the fingerprint of its master key.\r\n\r\nI think I am probably missing the point and don't have enough context, but I don't see how the current PR helps with this. I don't see how the wallet having a sticky hd key would help working with an external signer or creating a tr() descriptor. Like in general I could see how the wallet storing more information could help it work with external signers, but I don't understand how storing this particular bit of information would help.\r\n\r\n> Indeed. There's different proposals out there of how to derive keys for a multisig wallet, but I'm mainly thinking of two approaches [...] I prefer (2)\r\n\r\nI see, but that suggests this PR is good because the limitations it adds will force users to choose approach (2). So if you have a wallet with default descriptors you can't import a multisig using the same hd key, and if you have a wallet with a multisig descriptor you can't create default descriptors with the same hd key. But it seems like the approach in this PR would only be enforcing that selectively, and the resulting behavior would probably just be confusing. Wouldn't it be simpler and clearer to just have explicit checks when adding descriptors for the combinations of descriptors you don't want to allow? Again here I think it would be helpful to be more concrete and think about the specific RPC methods that would be used for these flows.\r\n\r\nI definitely don't understand everything and there could be real reasons why the approach in this PR makes sense. Just so far I haven't seen what the benefits are, and the drawbacks seem unpleasant.",

Wouldn't the flow be simpler if you just made one call to `createwalletdescriptor` or `importdescriptor` and it did both things? (**EDIT**: Actually rereading this, I can see why this wouldn't work because when you have multiple wallets you need to generate all the seeds first before you can generate the descriptor. I'm still not sure that requires all the complexity in this PR, but it does suggest why it is there.)\r\n\r\nReplying to my own comment, since I had a realization after I posted it and made the edit above.\r\n\r\nI think neither the approach in this PR nor the suggested approach in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26728#pullrequestreview-1791999003 will support multisig well by themselves. But I think this PR's approach of deriving a master key from existing (non-multisig) descriptors, storing it separately, and adding new wallet code in followup PRs to rely on it puts us in a worse starting place for providing a good multisig UX than the suggested approach. Mostly because of the complexity it adds, but also because it does not assign a specific purpose to the HD key, so it could encourages uses that \"co-mingle multisig and single sig funds in the same wallet\" like Sjors was trying to avoid.\r\n\r\nI don't think the flow for how we support multisig has to be decided now, since it's beyond the scope of this PR. But I do want to spell out how I think things could work more simply without this PR. I think to support multisig  and other more complicated cases well we will want to give the wallet the ability to store an HD master key not associated with any descriptor, and which can be used later to create complicated descriptors. But this could be supported with a new wallet field holding a `CExtPubKey` that is only set temporarily between creating the master key and creating a descriptor that uses it. It would need to be accompanied by a wallet flag preventing older wallets from using the wallet while the field exists, but as soon as the first descriptor is created using the master key, the flag and temporary field could be deleted, and the wallet would be backward compatible again and stay within our current data model.\r\n\r\nThis would allow a simpler flow for creating multisig wallets without adding a permanent burden and increase in complexity after they are created.",

      "body": "achow101, S3RK, Sjors, and me talked about this on a call. I think the plan for now is that achow will make 2 independent PRs targeted at different use-cases:\r\n\r\n- First PR would add a `gethdkey` method like the one in this PR and a `createwalletdescriptor` method like the one in [#25907](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25907) that should both make reusing existing hd keys easier. Specifically these methods should be useful for adding new types of descriptors to existing wallets and upgrading existing wallets. Unlike the current PRs, this new PR would be fully backwards compatible and not change the database format.\r\n\r\n- Second PR would implement a `sethdseed` implementation for descriptor wallets like [#29054](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29054) or a similar method that generates standalone hd keys not (yet) associated with any descriptor. This would be useful for creating multisig descriptors. The new keys would need to be stored in a new database field, or possibly multiple fields, so this would change the database format, but in a simple way that should avoid upgrade/downgrade pitfalls encountered in previous iterations of this PR with `DBKeys::ACTIVEHDKEY`. If we are concerned with having more than one HD key per wallet, this could be conservative about when it allows creating standalone HD keys. \r\n\r\n~S3RK~ achow made a wiki page https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Wallet-Use-Cases where we can start to look at different use cases, and what RPC calls would look like under different flows and models. On the call S3RK made the point that a model where wallets have exactly one active hd key at a time would be more consistent with other wallet software and more naturally align with the BIPs. I think this is definitely true, and I think we should optimize wallet UX for the case where there is only one active hd key, but also not be broken or confusing in cases where there is more than one hd key. So far, I haven't seen specific cases where supporting more than one hd key seems to hurt the UX or implementation, so I'm still skeptical of the idea that there is something wrong or bad about our current wallet model, even if it is different. But I think things should become clearer as we add features, and I think the two PR's above will keep our options open.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate: replacement for this PR which adds `gethdkey` and #25907 which adds `createwalletdescriptor` is #29130 which adds both methods. Replacement for #29054 which adds `sethdseed` for descriptor wallets is #29136 which introduces an `addhdkey` method.",

Thinking about this more, I wonder if a more natural way of representing standalone keys in the wallet is just to treat them as a new [descriptor type](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md#reference), like `void(KEY)`, where the void descriptor would hold the key, but instead of [expanding](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4b1196a9855dcd188a24f393aa2fa21e2d61f061/src/script/descriptor.h#L98) to a scriptPubKey or set of scriptPubKeys like other descriptors it would expand to the empty set. \r\n\r\nWe could treat this as an internal implementation detail, just using `void(xpub....)` as a way for the wallet to reference unused hd keys. But there could be benefits to using the type externally. For example, if we included these in `listdescriptors` output, users could continue using `listdescriptors` as a form of wallet backup, or way to see all the wallet keys a wallet contains, without having to call a new RPC method like `gethdkey`.\r\n\r\nBut I think the main advantage of this approach would just be fitting better into the existing database format, keeping it clean and easy to reason about, and also having more backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe idea of naming the descriptor `void(KEY)` just comes the void operator in javascript, and void type in c/c++/java\r\nwhich consume values without returning returning or signify functions that don't return values.",

Note how some might no longer be active because the user imported another descriptor and made it active. There might also be more than one set matching this pattern due to toggling encryption, so we pick the most recent one.\r\n* drop the `tr()` bit; it's not necessary, and it could cause a mismatch if a user did something like manually importing only the receive descriptor\r\n* document the meaning of `WALLET_FLAG_GLOBAL_HD_KEY`. It means we support the feature, but does not guarantee presence of an HD key.\r\n* add (a TODO for) method to the wallet tool to re-run the helper functions; this would be for advanced users who somehow ended up with a wallet not matching this pattern, but have repented, added the right descriptors, and now want the global HD key field set",

We _could_ set this field when creating a legacy wallet, but we (gladly) choose not to. It wouldn't do anything useful and would suffer from the same downgrade->encrypt->upgrade incorrectness. So I think we also shouldn't set the flag.\r\n\r\nI do agree with setting the flag for watch-only. That seems future-proof, e.g. imagine a scenario where a `WALLET_FLAG_DISABLE_PRIVATE_KEYS` can be removed; such a change should take care of setting the master hdkey, and not (implicitly) rely on the migration code in ea7a61ca94cc0d59cfe25307cd60fcda2aedec5f.\r\n\r\nThat in turn insures that migration code should never have to updated to account for future features, as it's only ever run on wallets that were last loaded with <v27.0",

The user could have imported new active descriptors with different keys and the hdkey would not change.\r\n\r\nThis is counterintuitive and I think it would be really helpful if one of the explanations of the ACTIVEHDKEY field (in the LoadDescriptorWalletRecords comment, or the LoadActiveHDPubKey comment, or the gethdkey RPC documentation) said what the relationship is between the active hd key and active descriptors. Presumeably the active hd key will be used for one set of things, and the active descriptors will be used for another set of things, but I don't think it's obvious what those things are.",
