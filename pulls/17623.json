Here also, Windows might react differently.  \r\n\r\nWith **-debuglogfile=\\bad\\file** it creates a file named **ad**.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am exaggerating things here, because nobody *would want* to use such contrived names.

Type: _mkdir ~/.bitcoin/crash_\r\n2. Type:  _sudo chown root:root ~/.bitcoin/crash_\r\n3. Run _bitcoin-qt_\r\n4. Go to menu _\"File\"_ -> _\"Open Wallet\"_, wallet will crash immediately\r\n\r\nIt's fixed by adding \"ec\" parameter into fs::exists() function to handle any error correctly.\r\n\r\n**Infinite loop:**\r\nIf iterator is not able to increment because of access denied to next level of recursive scan it will stay on the same position indefinitely causing wallet to stop responding.\r\n\r\nReproduction steps on Windows platform:\r\n1. Create new folder into bitcoin data folder (for example: _%Appdata%\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\\Loop_)\r\n2. Deny access to newly created folder for current user\r\n3. Run _bitcoin-qt.exe_\r\n4. Go to menu \"File\" -> \"Open Wallet\", wallet will hang indefinitely\r\n\r\nIt's fixed by disabling recursion if iterator increment failed.

This does **not** change the current default behavior of `dumptxoutset`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks to the future `assumeutxo` feature (#15605), we now have a `dumptxoutset` RPC (#16899) which can write the whole UTXO set to disk. However, the current format, although compact, is not easily readable by standard tools (e.g. for someone who would like to study the UTXO set). Plus this binary format might change in the future AFAIK.\r\n\r\nProviding power users an easy way to have a human-readable dump of the UTXOs would be a useful feature. We would this way replace [3rd party hackish tools](https://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-utxo-dump) [with possible side effects](https://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-utxo-dump/issues/12).\r\n\r\nOn my machine (slow SSD):\r\n* dumping the whole original 4GB binary UTXO set takes around 1mn40\r\n* dumping the set in whole ASCII form takes less than 9GB and 3mn30 (ofc file size/time depends on which ASCII data you write to disk; you can select them via the `format` argument).\r\n\r\nThanks!",
