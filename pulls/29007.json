    "body": "An address is placed in a `[bucket,position]` in the addrman table (new table or tried table) using the `addpeeraddress` RPC. This `[bucket,position]` is calculated using `nKey`(and other metrics) for the addrman which is chosen randomly during every run.\r\n\r\nSupposing there are 2 addresses to be placed in an addrman table. During every test run, a different `[bucket,position]` would be calculated for each address.These calculated `[bucket,position]` could even be the same for the 2 addresses in some test runs and result in collisions in the addrman. We wouldn't be able to predict when the collisions are going to happen because we can't predict the `nKey` value which is chosen at random. This can cause flaky tests.\r\n\r\nBecause of these non deterministic collisions, we are limited in what we can do to test addrman functionality. Currently in our tests don't add a second address to prevent these collisions from happening - we only keep 1 address in the new table and 1 address in the tried table. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26988#discussion_r1091145647, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23084, [#22831(comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22831/files#r708302639). \r\n\r\nThis PR lets us create a deterministic addrman with fixed `nKey` so that we can know the `[bucket,position]` collisions beforehand, safely add more addresses in an addrman table and write more extensive tests.",

          "body": "When trying to add an address to the IP address manager tried table, it's first added to the new table and then moved to the tried table. Previously, adding a conflicting address to the address manager's tried table with test-only `addpeeraddress tried=true` RPC would return `{ \"success\": true }`. However, the address would not be added to the tried table, but would remain in the new table. This caused, e.g., issue #28964.\r\n\r\nThis is fixed by new returning `{ \"success\":  false, \"error\": \"...\" }` for failed tried table additions. Since the address remaining in the new table can't be removed (the address manager interface does not support removing addresses at the moment and adding this seems to be a bigger effort), an error message is returned. This indicates to a user why the RPC failed and allows accounting for the extra address in the new table. This is done in the functional test for the `getrawaddrman` RPC.\r\n\r\nFixes #28964 ",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [ ] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick)\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add mempool transactions in a topologically-invalid way.\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts. Is this a problem?",

      "body": "approach ACK. yay for finally having addrman determinism in the functional tests 🙌🏽\r\ncouple thoughts to consider-\r\n\r\n#### 1. clearer subtest addrman setup in `rpc_net.py`\r\n\r\n@0xB10C\r\n\r\n> I think it would be ideal if we could avoid the addpeeraddress test leaking into getaddrmaninfo and getrawaddrman tests.\r\n> \r\n\r\nagreed. right now, the 3 subtests (`test_addpeeraddress`, `test_getaddrmaninfo` & `test_getrawaddrman`) have a lot of implicit dependencies, making the overall test harder to understand & develop on.\r\n\r\nhere's a suggestion with the intention of making the addrman setup more clear in each subtest:\r\n\r\n- introduce a helper, eg. `seed_addrman` which uses `addpeeraddress` to add addresses from all the different networks to addrman.\r\n- in the beginning of `test_getaddrmaninfo` & `test_getrawaddrman`, get a clean addrman (by using either method mentioned by @0xB10C) and call `seed_addrman` to populate it in an expected way. then each subtest would check the results with the relevant RPC\r\n\r\n#### 2. remove `addrmantest` / `test=localaddr`\r\n\r\nI am not convinced that this test-only behavior is worth maintaining. the only thing that `p2p_node_network_limited.py` is testing is that 1. an addr message is received & 2. the expected services are advertised. # 1 is forced to true via the test-only codepath in `GetLocalAddrForPeer`, and the value of # 2 is nominal due to how easily the test-only code could diverge from the mainnet logic.\r\n\r\nMy vote is to remove this functionality & related code.

I think it would be ideal if we could avoid the `addpeeraddress` test _leaking_ into `getaddrmaninfo` and `getrawaddrman` tests. \r\n\r\nThis also becomes relevant in the context of #28998 where we might want to produce a tried table collision on purpose to have coverage of the `addpeeraddress` RPC failure path. The easiest way of producing a collision is by adding more and more addresses to the tried table (as we do in the [unit test](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2e8ec6b338a825a7155fff1be83993e3834ab655/src/test/addrman_tests.cpp#L352C4-L364)). This would leave us with quite a few additional addresses already in the tried table.\r\n\r\nI currently see two possibilities for clearing the addrman tables between tests:\r\n1. shutdown the node, delete `peers.dat`, and restart\r\n2. have a third node for this test that's only used for `getrawaddrman`.\r\n",
