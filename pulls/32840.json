    "body": "Added assertions to the GetTxSigOpCost test cases to verify that the witness of a coinbase transaction is not considered in the signature operation cost calculations.\r\n\r\nUsing spendingTx.vin[0].prevout.SetNull() we create a coinbase transaction that evaluates to true for IsCoinbase(). Doing this to transactions (spendingTx in this case) that evaluate to a non-zero sigop output, we more concretely test that the witness of a coinbase transaction is not taken into account for SigOp maths.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nIn my experimentation in mining software (mostly Stratum v2) I encountered the SigOps budget and began exploring the considerations as it applies to coinbase transactions. It was unclear how commitment-type addresses for coinbase were handled compared to bare script when it came to SigOp calculation. Upon further investigation, I saw that the test suite could have added vectors that clearly demonstrate that the witness for a coinbase transaction is not considered for `GetTransactionSigOpCost`. \r\n\r\nAdding these tests makes it more clear for someone in the future how SigOp maths work while exploring the intersection of SigOps and coinbase transactions.",

Doing this to transactions (spendingTx in this case) that evaluate to a non-zero sigop output, we more concretely test that the witness of a coinbase transaction is not taken into account for SigOp maths.",
