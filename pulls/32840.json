    "body": "Added assertions to the GetTxSigOpCost test cases to verify that the witness of a coinbase transaction is not considered in the signature operation cost calculations.\r\n\r\nUsing spendingTx.vin[0].prevout.SetNull() we create a coinbase transaction that evaluates to true for IsCoinbase(). Doing this to transactions (spendingTx in this case) that evaluate to a non-zero sigop output, we more concretely test that the witness of a coinbase transaction is not taken into account for SigOp maths.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nIn my experimentation in mining software (mostly Stratum v2) I encountered the SigOps budget and began exploring the considerations as it applies to coinbase transactions. It was unclear how commitment-type addresses for coinbase were handled compared to bare script when it came to SigOp calculation. Upon further investigation, I saw that the test suite could have added vectors that clearly demonstrate that the witness for a coinbase transaction is not considered for `GetTransactionSigOpCost`. \r\n\r\nAdding these tests makes it more clear for someone in the future how SigOp maths work while exploring the intersection of SigOps and coinbase transactions.",

The \"what\" is already in the code. The commit messages seem LLM generated, they don't add a lot of value this way.\r\n\r\nThe first commit still adds a test that claims we're testing the witness when in fact it's empty: [`a4376ab` (#32840)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32840/commits/a4376abd72aae5c0ea158db66440618cb1abfe5a#r2492179386)\r\nThe second commit adds dead code, only used in later commit - not a clean separation of features.\r\nThe third does random refactors - we can group these in a cleanup commit, preferably after the test cases are already split.\r\n\r\nI would make the test split the first commit, containing the smallest change that can allow us to untangle them, with the minimum helpers since we're already uindenting all lines, we shouldn't do anything else that isn't strictly necessary for the separation.\r\nThe second commit could do the cleanup, refactor only, low risk - BOOST helpers,  suffix removals, useless comments, brace inits, for loops, etc. We can even split the cleanup, but after the tests are separated this should be easy to review.\r\nAfter cleanups, the very last commit could be the one you're suggesting, done in clean environment for clarity and ease of review.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's any way I can help.",
