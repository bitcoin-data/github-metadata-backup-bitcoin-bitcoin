    "body": "Part of cluster mempool: #30289. Based on #30605.\r\n\r\nThis replaces the cluster linearization algorithm introduced in #30126 and #30286 (a combination of LIMO with candidate-set search), with a completely different algorithm: [spanning-forest linearization](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/spanning-forest-cluster-linearization/1419/1), which appears to have much better performance for hard clusters. See [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-to-linearize-your-cluster/303/68) for a comparison between various linearization algorithms, and [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-to-linearize-your-cluster/303/73) for benchmarks comparing them. Replaying historical mempool data on it shows that it can effectively linearize every observed cluster up to 64 transactions optimally within tens of microseconds, though pathological examples can be created which take longer.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is effectively a very specialized version of the [simplex algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm) to the problem of finding high-feerate topological subsets of clusters, but modified to find all consecutive such subsets concurrently rather than just the first one. See the post above for how it is related.\r\n\r\nIt represents the cluster as partitioned into a set of chunks, each with a spanning tree of its internal dependencies connecting the transactions. Randomized improvements are made by selecting dependencies to add and remove to these spanning trees, merging and splitting chunks, until no more improvements are possible. Like simplex, it does not necessarily make progress in every step, and thus has no upper bound on its runtime, but randomization makes long runtimes very unlikely, and additionally makes it hard to adversarially construct clusters in which the algorithm reliably makes bad choices.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@instagibbs  I believe the only cases that should be slower with SFL are either very small examples (where their time is irrelevant because its very low per tx compared to bigger clusters)  and ones with huge numbers of dependencies.   Beyond huge dependencies being generally unrepresentative they're also expensive to generate because every dependency needs a vin, they also tend to be so slow with both that I guess neither will run to completion in practice.\r\n\r\nA better way to compare across implementations might be some kind of optimization time vs amount of fee required to create a cluster with that dependency geometry (just assuming a 1s/vb feerate or something, not adding up the actual costs in the cluster because another cluster could exist with the same topology but different fees/size). like fee = 16\\*txn + 41\\*inputs_consumed + 9\\*outputs_consumed_within_cluster -- so I'd hope to find that SFL always beats the current exponential algorithm on this kind of metric (except for very small inputs).\r\n\r\nThe exponential algorithm gets faster with dependency rich clusters because the linearization essentially becomes topologically forced, so the current algorithm doesn't have many options to consider.  If it massive high dependency clusters became common on the network in the future it might make sense to bring back the exponential algorithm for  them.  :P  but I doubt that would happen.\r\n",

      "body": "@instagibbs @ismaelsadeeq @gmaxwell FWIW, I didn't include apples-to-apples comparison because the large-scale comparison [benchmarks](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-to-linearize-your-cluster/303/73) I did (especially, [this one](https://delvingbitcoin.org/uploads/default/original/2X/2/22ad16f71db37fcb8cadb8a8f73c4acfd3def203.png)) were just overwhelmingly in favor of SFL over the existing one. The benchmarks were mostly done to decide between SFL and another replacement algorithm, GGT, but see the reasons for choosing SFL [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-to-linearize-your-cluster/303/68).\r\n\r\nA fair apples-to-apples comparison I think needs to use a dataset large enough to encompass both good and bad cases for each of the algorithms, and not be specifically biased for one of them, which is hard in a benchmark I can include in the PR directly. If people are interested, I can try to clean up the branch I used to create the graphs above, however.",
