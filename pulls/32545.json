    "body": "Part of cluster mempool: #30289.\r\n\r\nThis replaces the cluster linearization algorithm introduced in #30126 and #30286 (a combination of LIMO with candidate-set search), with a completely different algorithm: [spanning-forest linearization](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/spanning-forest-cluster-linearization/1419/1), which appears to have much better performance for hard clusters. See [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-to-linearize-your-cluster/303/68) for a comparison between various linearization algorithms, and [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-to-linearize-your-cluster/303/73) for benchmarks comparing them. Replaying historical mempool data on it shows that it can effectively linearize every observed cluster up to 64 transactions optimally within tens of microseconds, though pathological examples can be created which take longer.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is effectively a very specialized version of the [simplex algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm) to the problem of finding high-feerate topological subsets of clusters, but modified to find all consecutive such subsets concurrently rather than just the first one. See the post above for how it is related.\r\n\r\nIt represents the cluster as partitioned into a set of chunks, each with a spanning tree of its internal dependencies connecting the transactions. Randomized improvements are made by selecting dependencies to add and remove to these spanning trees, merging and splitting chunks, until no more improvements are possible, or a computation budget is reached. Like simplex, it does not necessarily make progress in every step, and thus has no upper bound on its runtime to find optimal, but randomization makes long runtimes very unlikely, and additionally makes it hard to adversarially construct clusters in which the algorithm reliably makes bad choices.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@instagibbs  I believe the only cases that should be slower with SFL are either very small examples (where their time is irrelevant because its very low per tx compared to bigger clusters)  and ones with huge numbers of dependencies.   Beyond huge dependencies being generally unrepresentative they're also expensive to generate because every dependency needs a vin, they also tend to be so slow with both that I guess neither will run to completion in practice.\r\n\r\nA better way to compare across implementations might be some kind of optimization time vs amount of fee required to create a cluster with that dependency geometry (just assuming a 1s/vb feerate or something, not adding up the actual costs in the cluster because another cluster could exist with the same topology but different fees/size). like fee = 16\\*txn + 41\\*inputs_consumed + 9\\*outputs_consumed_within_cluster -- so I'd hope to find that SFL always beats the current exponential algorithm on this kind of metric (except for very small inputs).\r\n\r\nThe exponential algorithm gets faster with dependency rich clusters because the linearization essentially becomes topologically forced, so the current algorithm doesn't have many options to consider.  If it massive high dependency clusters became common on the network in the future it might make sense to bring back the exponential algorithm for  them.  :P  but I doubt that would happen.\r\n",

      "body": "@instagibbs @ismaelsadeeq @gmaxwell FWIW, I didn't include apples-to-apples comparison because the large-scale comparison [benchmarks](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-to-linearize-your-cluster/303/73) I did (especially, [this one](https://delvingbitcoin.org/uploads/default/original/2X/2/22ad16f71db37fcb8cadb8a8f73c4acfd3def203.png)) were just overwhelmingly in favor of SFL over the existing one. The benchmarks were mostly done to decide between SFL and another replacement algorithm, GGT, but see the reasons for choosing SFL [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-to-linearize-your-cluster/303/68).\r\n\r\nA fair apples-to-apples comparison I think needs to use a dataset large enough to encompass both good and bad cases for each of the algorithms, and not be specifically biased for one of them, which is hard in a benchmark I can include in the PR directly. If people are interested, I can try to clean up the branch I used to create the graphs above, however.",

The big advantage is that this approach also works when one already has a linearization which is not entirely topological already.\r\n\r\nAlso the following changes to the `cluster_linearize.h` code in general:\r\n* Using SFL gaining the ability to fix existing linearizations, replaced `FixLinearization` with just making this feature part of `Linearize`.\r\n* With the LIMO-based `Linearize`, and `MergeLinearizations` (see below), gone, there is no more need for the `LinearizationChunking` class.\r\n\r\nAnd as a result some changes in `TxGraph` are possible too:\r\n* Removed the need for `FixLinearization` by introducing `QualityLevel` states to represent \"may be non-topological\", which makes the next call to `Linearize()` do the fixing instead.\r\n* Removed `MergeLinearizations`, as it was never used.\r\n* As SFL, upon being fed an existing linearization, runs through an initialization procedure that is pretty much equivalent to `PostLinearize`, drop all calls to `PostLinearize()` *prior* to `Linearize()` calls.\r\n* Because the new algorithm randomizes output linearization order (within equal-chunk-feerate parts), undo some of the non-determinism that introduces by always calling `PostLinearize()` *after* `Linearize()` calls (before it would only do this if non-optimal).\r\n",

The new algorithm uses a fundamentally different approach based on maintaining spanning trees within chunks and performing split/merge operations.\n\n**Key Changes:**\n- Replaces search-based linearization with spanning-forest based approach\n- Simplifies quality level management by introducing `NEEDS_FIX` and `NEEDS_SPLIT_FIX` states\n- Updates the `ExtractTransactions` interface to use two separate visitor callbacks\n\n### Reviewed Changes\n\nCopilot reviewed 6 out of 7 changed files in this pull request and generated 2 comments.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Show a summary per file</summary>\n\n| File | Description |\r\n| ---- | ----------- |\r\n| src/txgraph.cpp | Implements quality level changes, updates transaction extraction to use two-pass visitors, modifies merging/splitting logic to work with new algorithm |\r\n| src/test/util/cluster_linearize.h | Adjusts test utilities for changed type parameters and updated iteration bounds |\r\n| src/test/fuzz/txgraph.cpp | Updates fuzz tests to use new chunking API |\r\n| src/test/fuzz/cluster_linearize.cpp | Removes tests for deprecated algorithm components, adds tests for new chunking functions |\r\n| src/cluster_linearize.h | Replaces entire linearization algorithm implementation with spanning-forest approach, adds `ChunkLinearizationInfo` function |\r\n| src/bench/cluster_linearize.cpp | Updates benchmarks to test new algorithm with historical and random cluster examples |\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Comments suppressed due to low confidence (1)</summary>\n\n**src/test/fuzz/cluster_linearize.cpp:1**\n* [nitpick] The variable name `done` changed from `TestBitSet` to `SetType`. While this makes the code more generic, verify that this change aligns with the intended test coverage, as the original code may have been explicitly testing with `TestBitSet` for specific reasons.\n```\n// Copyright (c) The Bitcoin Core developers\n```\n</details>\n\n\n\n---\n\n<sub>**Tip:** Customize your code reviews with copilot-instructions.md. <a href=\"/bitcoin/bitcoin/new/master/.github?filename=copilot-instructions.md\" class=\"Link--inTextBlock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Create the file</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot\" class=\"Link--inTextBlock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">learn how to get started</a>.</sub>",

Given a chunk c,\nan active dependency d in it, and the chunks (t, b) that c would split into\nif d were deactivated, the gain is defined as either (they are equivalent):\n\n  (feerate(t) - feerate(b)) * size(t) * size(b)\n  fee(t) * size(b) - fee(b) * size(t)\n\nIt happens to also be equal to these:\n\n  (feerate(t) - feerate(c)) * size(t) * size(c)\n  fee(t) * size(c) - fee(c) * size(t)\n\nIts relevance is that this metric is proportional to a lower bound on the area\nunder the fee-size diagram which would be gained IF a deactivation of d does not\nresult in a self-merge of t and b again.\n\nThis commit adds logic to find, within each chunk, the dependency with the highest\ngain.

Each\n+ * transaction may be in its own chunk (and thus 0 dependencies are active), or all transactions\n+ * may form a single chunk (and thus N-1 dependencies are active).\n+ *\n+ * Each chunk has a feerate: the total fee of all transactions in it divided by the total size of\n+ * all transactions in it. We say the spanning forest is topological whenever no inactive\n+ * dependencies exist from one chunk to another chunk with lower or equal feerate. The algorithm\n+ * can be stopped whenever the state is topological. In this case, the output linearization\n+ * consists of each of the chunks, from high to low feerate, each internally ordered in an\n+ * arbitrary but topologically-valid way. If the spanning forest is topological, then the output\n+ * linearization is also topological.\n+ *\n+ * At a high level, the algorithm works by performing a sequence of the following operations:\n+ * - Merging:\n+ *   - Whenever an inactive dependency exists from a chunk to another chunk which has lower or\n+ *     equal feerate, that dependency can be made active, merging the two chunks.\n+ *   - Merging is only possible in non-topological forests, and generally helps making it\n+ *     topological.\n+ * - Splitting:\n+ *   - Whenever an active dependency d exists, making it inactive will result in the chunk it is in\n+ *     splitting in two: a bottom chunk (which d is from) and a top chunk (which d is to). This is\n+ *     the case because no other active dependency between the top and bottom can exist; if it did,\n+ *     it would form a cycle together with d.\n+ *   - An active dependency can be deactivated whenever its would-be top chunk has strictly higher\n+ *     feerate than its would-be bottom chunk.\n+ *   - Splitting generally helps making a forest's output linearization better, but can result in\n+ *     it becoming non-topological, necessitating merging steps.\n+ *\n+ * A forest is said to be optimal when neither of these operations are applicable anymore. It can\n+ * be shown that the output linearization for an optimal spanning forest is optimal, and that at\n+ * least one optimal spanning forest exists for every cluster. Note that no proof exists that an\n+ * optimal state will always be reached.\n+ *\n+ * To make sure the algorithm can be interrupted quickly and get a valid linearization out, merging\n+ * will always be prioritized over splitting:\n+ *\n+ * - Construct an initial topological spanning forest for the graph.\n+ * - Loop until optimal or time runs out:\n+ *   - Perform a splitting step.\n+ *   - Loop until the forest is topological:\n+ *     - Perform a merging step.\n+ * - Output the chunks from high to low feerate, each internally sorted topologically.\n+ *\n+ * Merging is always done by maximal feerate difference. This guarantees that the sequence of a\n+ * single split followed by merges until topological never makes the output linearization worse.\n+ * In addition, this allows refining the algorithm flow into:\n+ *\n+ * - Construct an initial topological spanning forest for the graph:\n+ *   - Start with graph with all dependencies inactive (i.e., each transaction is a singleton\n+ *     chunk).\n+ *   - Make the graph topological by randomly picking chunks, and merging them (with their\n+ *     lowest-feerate dependency, or highest-feerate dependee) when possible, until no such chunks\n+ *     remain.\n+ * - Loop until optimal or time runs out:\n+ *   - Pick a dependency D to deactivate among those whose would-be top chunk has strictly higher\n+ *     feerate than its would-be bottom chunk.\n+ *   - Deactivate D, causing the chunk it is in to split into top T and bottom B.\n+ *   - Merge T with its lowest-feerate dependency, if any. Repeat the same with the merged result.\n+ *   - Merge B with its highest-feerate dependee, if any. Repeat the same with the merged result.\n+ * - Output the chunks from high to low feerate, each internally sorted topologically.\n+ *\n+ * Instead of starting with an empty graph and making it topological directly, it is possible to\n+ * bootstrap from an existing linearization:\n+ * - Start with an empty graph.\n+ * - For each transaction t in the existing linearization:\n+ *   - Add the transaction as a singleton chunk to the graph.\n+ *   - Merge the newly created chunk with its lowest-feerate dependency, if any. Repeat with the\n+ *     merged result.\n+ *\n+ * This guarantees an initial, topological, state whose output linearization is at least as good\n+ * (in the convexified feerate diagram sense) as the input existing linearization bootstrapped from.\n+ *\n+ * What remains to be specified are two heuristics:\n+ *\n+ * - How to decide what dependency to deactivate (when splitting chunks):\n+ *   - Define the gain of an active dependency as\n+ *     (feerate(top) - feerate(chunk)) * size(top) * size(chunk), also equal to:\n+ *     fee(top) * size(chunk) - fee(chunk) * size(top).\n+ *   - After every split, it is possible that the top and the bottom chunk merge with each other\n+ *     again in the merge sequence (through a top->bottom dependency, not through the deactivated\n+ *     one, which was bottom->top). Call this a self-merge. If a self-merge does not occur after\n+ *     a split, the resulting linearization is strictly improved (the area under the fee-size\n+ *     diagram increases by at least gain/2), while self-merges do not change it.\n+ *   - Keep track of how many consecutive self-merges a chunk undergoes: incremented upon\n+ *     self-merge, and reset to 0 in both top and bottom otherwise.\n+ *   - If the number of consecutive self-merges is 2 mod 3 (i.e., it is 2, 5, 8, 11, ...), a\n+ *     uniformly random dependency in the chunk among those with strictly positive gain is\n+ *     deactivated.\n+ *   - Otherwise (self-merges so far is not 2 mod 3), a uniformly random dependency within a chunk\n+ *     among those with maximal gain is deactivated, if any with strictly positive gain exist.\n+ *\n+ * - How to decide what dependency to activate (when merging chunks):\n+ *   - A uniformly random dependency between the two maximum-feerate-difference chunks is activated.\n+ *\n+ * If an optimal state is found by the above procedure, it is still possible that it contains\n+ * chunks that can be split further into equal-feerate chunks. To find these, a second stage is\n+ * added, which acts as if the feerates of transactions are perturbed slightly, to make\n+ * equal-feerate parts of chunks break apart. The idea is:\n+ * - If a transaction t is given slightly higher feerate than it really has, and an equal-feerate\n+ *   topological subset of the chunk exists with t in it, it will be found using the normal\n+ *   algorithm.\n+ * - If a transaction t is given slightly *lower* feerate than it really has, and an equal-feerate\n+ *   topological subset of the chunk exists with t *not* in it, it will be found using the normal\n+ *   algorithm.\n+ * Thus, by picking one transaction in a chunk, and trying both of the approaches above, then if a\n+ * split exists, it must be found, because the subset must either contain t or not contain it.\n+ *\n+ * Specifically, within each chunk:\n+ * - Pick an arbitrary pivot transaction t in the chunk.\n+ * - Loop:\n+ *   - Find a gain=0 dependency d in the chunk where t appears in its top.
