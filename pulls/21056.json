    "body": "Adds a new numeric `-rpcwaittimeout` that can be used to limit the\r\ntime we spend waiting on the RPC server to appear. This is used by\r\ndownstream projects to provide a bit of slack when `bitcoind`s RPC\r\ninterface is not available right away.\r\n\r\nThis makes the `-rpcwait` argument more useful, since we can now limit\r\nhow long we'll ultimately wait, before potentially giving up and reporting\r\nan error to the caller. It was discussed in the context of the BTCPayServer\r\nwanting to have c-lightning wait for the RPC interface to become available\r\nbut still have the option of giving up eventually ([4355]).\r\n\r\nI checked with laanwj whether this is already possible ([comment]), and\r\nwhether this would be a welcome change. Initially I intended to repurpose\r\nthe (optional) argument to `-rpcwait`, however I decided against it since it\r\nwould potentially break existing configurations, using things like `rpcwait=1`,\r\nor `rpcwait=true` (the former would have an unintended short timeout, when\r\nold behavior was to wait indefinitely).\r\n\r\n~Due to its simplicity I didn't implement a test for it yet, but if that's desired I\r\ncan provide one.~ Test was added during reviews.\r\n\r\n[4355]: https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/4355\r\n[comment]: https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/4355#issuecomment-768288261",

An alternative would be to specify attempt count.\r\n\r\nExcellent point/ The reason I went for the deadline approach was that in between sleeps we are actually attempting to connect over the network, which has its own timeout (`DEFAULT_HTTP_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`), which would cause drift if we were to just count the attempts instead of using the delta.\r\n\r\nEffectively the time we can wait in the worst case is `-rpcwaittimeout + DEFAULT_HTTP_CLIENT_TIMEOUT` if we happen to start an attempt right before the deadline gets triggered. If we were counting we'd have a maximum of `-rpcwaittimeout * (1s + DEFAULT_HTTP_CLIENT_TIMEOUT)` , which isn't really the interface I'd feel comfortable using.",

It's generally the more stable way, less moving parts, less potential ambiguity in input arguments. But it's an aside of course and off topic here.\n\nNot trying to make this a `lightningd` specific proposal, but since it was brought up I'll try to reconstruct the rationale at the time.\n\nIt was/is easier to call out to an existing program that includes the logic for authentication, error handling and timeouts than to implement it from scratch on top of out io library which doesn't have good http support (this is likely self-inflicted, but it's what we've got and it's working well for us so far). Authentication here being the big win, since if you have `bitcoin-cli` working you don't have to do anything to configure `lightningd` to be able to talk to `bitcoind` (no need to handle cookie auth, user/pass auth, binding and connecting, no need to implement TLS). If we had implemented all these things we'd likely have ended up replicating all the functionality `bitcoin-cli` already has, which didn't seem like a good investment of time given the already huge amount of work to be done.\n\nAre there downsides of calling out to `bitcoin-cli`? Sure. Will we eventually end up replacing it with an internal implementation? Maybe. Is it working well as it is now? I think so 😉\n\nThat being said, I'm sure we're not the only ones that could use a wait timeout (thinking primarily of scripts and operations).",

      "body": "> Are there downsides of calling out to bitcoin-cli? Sure. Will we eventually end up replacing it with an internal implementation? Maybe. Is it working well as it is now? I think so\r\n\r\nI guess it's mostly down to personal preference,  I prefer to use APIs directly, calling out to external programs reminds me of shell scripts which always are very environment-dependent. One concrete case is that bitcoin RPC might be forwarded from another container. Right now it's necessary to copy `bitcoin-cli` to the container hosting c-lightning. \r\n\r\nAlso as `bitcoin-cli` is aimed at human users, it has some client-side processing for arguments—some arguments are parsed as JSON others string-ized. Sending JSON directly is more \"pure\". Due to this added \"moving part\" I would personally prefer to avoid it from robust software.\r\n\r\nAlso accessing the API directly gives you full control over things such as timeouts. No need to wait for PRs to be merged here and then part of a release so that users have it :smile:  JSONRPC handling is straightforward if you already have JSON for your own APIs.\r\n\r\n> It was/is easier to call out to an existing program that includes the logic for authentication\r\n\r\nFor authentication—I'd somewhat agree, but we don't do anything complex such as HMAC or challenge/response. The only available authentication mechanism is HTTP basic authentication with a)  send `$DATADIR/.cookie` as user/password or b) manually provide user/password.\r\n\r\n> no need to implement TLS\r\n\r\nThere hasn't been TLS support in `bitcoin-cli` for years.\r\n\r\nSorry for derailing this further. Again, this is not meant as criticism on this change nor on `lightningd` (and I'm not volunteering to make a patch to change this). As you say, it works  :woman_shrugging: ",

      "body": "Reworded the release notes as proposed by @jonatack, and rebased on top of `master`.\r\n\r\nOpen questions are:\r\n\r\n - Add a specific error message pointing towards a timeout if we get something like `RPC warmup`\r\n   - Pointed out [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21056#discussion_r576924237)\r\n   - I think passing through the error is correct here, and not amend it since the timeout is merely retrying a failing attempt and eventually we give up passing through the cause. If we were to customize the error we could end up hiding the underlying cause for the failure (timeout ok, but what caused the timeout to fail ultimately?)\r\n - Instead of adding a new command line option in the form of `-rpcwaittimeout`, merge it instead with `-rpcwait`, redefining the semantics of the value. See above for discussion but here's a summary:\r\n   - Pro: merging avoids adding a new option, making the expression more concise\r\n   - Con: users may have scripts and utilities that use `-rpcwait=1` to opt into the waiting, but with the new semantics we'd just wait for 1 second. Also suddenly things like `-rpcwait=true` would be invalid or we'd require workarounds mapping `true`, `on` etc to `0`.\r\n\r\nAnything I'm missing?",

          "body": "# Overview\r\n**Description** This PR changes the return format of `-getinfo`\r\n\r\n**Rationale**  \r\n- make `-getinfo` more user-friendly\r\n- uses less vertical screen space.\r\n\r\nFixes: Issue 17314(Not linking issue to prevent it from closing)\r\n> Alternative, more human-friendly, format besides JSON? Colors, progress bars\r\n\r\n### Return Format\r\n```bash\r\n// Data from getblockchaininfo\r\nChain: [getblockchaininfo.chain] \r\nBlocks: [getblockchaininfo.blocks]\r\nHeaders: [getblockchaininfo.headers]\r\nVerification progress: [getblockchaininfo.verificationprogress]\r\nDifficulty: [getblockchaininfo.difficulty]\r\n\r\n# Data from getnetworkinfo\r\nNetwork: in [getnetworkinfo.connections_in], out [getnetworkinfo.connections_out], total [getnetworkinfo.connections]\r\nVersion: [getnetworkinfo.version]\r\nTime offset (s): [getnetworkinfo.timeoffset]\r\nProxy: [getnetworkinfo.proxy] // \"N/A\" if no proxy\r\nMin tx relay fee rate (BTC/kvB): [getnetworkinfo.relayfee]\r\n\r\n# Data from getwalletinfo. Will only be present when a single wallet is loaded\r\nWallet: [getnetworkinfo.walletname] // \"\" if walletname is empty(default wallet)\r\nKeypool size: [getnetworkinfo.keypoolsize]\r\nUnlocked until: [getnetworkinfo.unlocked_until]\r\nTransaction fee rate (-paytxfee) (BTC/kvB): [getnetworkinfo.paytxfee]\r\n\r\n# Data from getbalances. Will only be present when a single wallet is loaded\r\nBalance: [getbalances.mine.trusted]\r\n\r\n# Data from listwallets then getbalances for each wallet. Will only be present for multiple wallets loaded\r\nBalances\r\n[getbalances.mine.trusted] [listwallets[i]] // Right justify on balance\r\n\r\nWarnings: [getnetworkinfo.warnings]\r\n```\r\n#### Coloring\r\nThe following lines would be colored to better show the differences between the various `-getinfo` components. However, this will not apply for `WIN32`(ANSI code not supported) and users that connect the `stdout` to a non-terminal process.\r\n- `Chain: ...`:  BLUE(`\\x1B[34m`)\r\n- `Network: ...`: GREEN(`\\x1B[32m`)\r\n- `Wallet: ...`: MAGENTA(`\\x1B[35m`)\r\n- `Balance: ...` CYAN(`\\x1B[36m`)\r\n- `Balances: ...` CYAN(`\\x1B[36m`)\r\n- `Warnings: ...` Yellow(`\\x1B[33m`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n*No wallet loaded:*\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49265907/121794631-94b62080-cc3c-11eb-8627-d0d1c25f0878.png)\r\n\r\n*Single wallet loaded*\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49265907/121794619-6df7ea00-cc3c-11eb-8420-d0c18236b188.png)\r\n\r\n*Multi wallet loaded*\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49265907/121794626-810aba00-cc3c-11eb-8cd7-c15ede1918ac.png)\r\n\r\n# Reviewing Notes\r\n\r\n## Testing Scenarios\r\n\r\n**1. No wallet loaded**\r\n- When there no wallets are loaded(Unload wallet with `./src/bitcoin-cli unloadwallet \"YOUR_WALLETNAME\"`\r\n-  Test with `./src/bitcoin-cli -getinfo`.\r\n- Should only display `chain` and `network` segment\r\n\r\n**2. Single wallet loaded**\r\n- When only a single wallet loaded or `-rpcwallet` is set(Load wallet with `./src/bitcoin-cli loadwallet \"YOUR_WALLETNAME\"`)\r\n- Test with `./src/bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=\"YOUR_WALLETNAME\" -getinfo`(Load wallet with `./src/bitcoin-cli loadwallet \"YOUR_WALLETNAME\"`)\r\n- Should only display `chain`, `network`, `wallet` and `balance` segment\r\n\r\n**3. Multiple wallet loaded**\r\n- When there are multiple wallets loaded(Load wallet with `./src/bitcoin-cli loadwallet \"YOUR_WALLETNAME\"`)\r\n- Test with `./src/bitcoin-cli -getinfo`\r\n- Should only display `chain`, `network` and `balances` segment\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n**Current Flow**\r\n1. `GetinfoRequestHandler` is instantiated\r\n2. `ConnectAndCallRPC` is called with `GetinfoRequestHandler`. It returns `UniValue::VOBJ result`\r\n3. If `-rpcwallet` wallet is not set, `GetWalletBalances` is called with a pointer to `result` as a parameter. It adds the balances for all the wallets to `result`\r\n\r\n**New Flow**\r\n1. `GetinfoRequestHandler` is instantiated\r\n2. `ConnectAndCallRPC` is called with `GetinfoRequestHandler`. It returns `UniValue::VOBJ result`\r\n3. If `-rpcwallet` wallet is not set, `GetWalletBalances` is called with a pointer to `result` as a parameter. It adds the balances for all the wallets to `result`\r\n4. **New** `ParseGetInfoResult` is called with `result` as parameter. It converts results type from `UniValue::VOBJ` to `UniValue::VSTR` according to the format stated above. ",

          "body": "Bitcoin merged this feature in June (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21056):\r\n> Adds a new numeric `-rpcwaittimeout` that can be used to limit the\r\ntime we spend waiting on the RPC server to appear. This is used by\r\ndownstream projects to provide a bit of slack when `bitcoind`s RPC\r\ninterface is not available right away.\r\n>\r\n> This makes the `-rpcwait` argument more useful, since we can now limit\r\nhow long we'll ultimately wait, before potentially giving up and reporting\r\nan error to the caller. \r\n\r\nI think it would be a welcome addition to the Gridcoin wallet.  The caveat, however, is that in order to implement the above feature we also need upstream's `rpcwait` parameter.  Reference https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3283.\r\nBoth of these will likely need to be ported together.",
