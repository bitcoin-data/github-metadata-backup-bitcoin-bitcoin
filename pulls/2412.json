The first commit adds this feature to the core, accessed through SetNetworkActive().\n\nSecond commit adds an RPC command \"togglenetwork\" to toggle on/off.\n\nThird commit adds further connections to the gui. When the network activity is disabled the status bar and the debug window will show this. In addition the commit adds a button to the debug window to toggle network activity.\n\n![bitcoin-network-activity](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/420734/301091/75019bd4-95bd-11e2-91f2-c37c05891b31.png)\n\nOpen issues:\n- Should the core close the listening socket or is it enough to just disregard incoming connections by closing them immediately?\n- Should SetNetworkActive() return an error code or can it throw exceptions?\n",

Are you suggesting a row in the debug window showing for example \"Network state:  <state>\"?\n\nI think double clicking on the connection symbol could also be a solution. I'm wondering though if the feature will be too hard to discover in that case, since it is not apparent that the symbol can be clicked. Also, if somebody clicked it by accident (maybe not likely?) they would not know how to get connected again.\n",

This may be acceptable for the user most of the time, but in some cases the user temporarily needs a low latency connection. In this case the only option currently is to close the client and reopen it later, which can take quite a while and create a lot of disk activity when the block chain is reloaded. Being able to temporarily close all connections provides a solution for this.\n",
