    "body": "See #27463 for full project tracking.\r\n\r\nThis contains the first few commits of #30110, which require some thinking about thread safety in review.\r\n- Introduce a new `m_tx_download_mutex` which guards the transaction download data structures including `m_txrequest`, the rolling bloom filters, and `m_orphanage`. Later this should become the mutex guarding `TxDownloadManager`.\r\n  - `m_txrequest` doesn't need to be guarded using `cs_main` anymore\r\n  - `m_recent_confirmed_transactions` doesn't need its own lock anymore\r\n  - `m_orphanage` doesn't need its own lock anymore\r\n- Adds a new `ValidationInterface` event, `ActiveTipChanged`, which is a synchronous callback whenever the tip of the active chainstate changes.\r\n- Flush `m_recent_rejects` and `m_recent_rejects_reconsiderable` on `ActiveTipChanged` just once instead of checking the tip every time `AlreadyHaveTx` is called. This should speed up calls to that function (no longer comparing a block hash each time) and removes the need to lock `cs_main` every time it is called.\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n- These data structures need synchronization. While we are holding `m_tx_download_mutex`, these should hold:\r\n  - a tx hash in `m_txrequest` is not also in `m_orphanage`\r\n  - a tx hash in `m_txrequest` is not also in `m_recent_rejects` or `m_recent_confirmed_transactions`\r\n  - In the future, orphan resolution tracking should also be synchronized. If a tx has an entry in the orphan resolution tracker, it is also in `m_orphanage`, and not in `m_txrequest`, etc.\r\n- Currently, `cs_main` is used to e.g. sync accesses to `m_txrequest`. We should not broaden the scope of things it locks.\r\n- Currently, we need to know the current chainstate every time we call `AlreadyHaveTx` so we can decide whether we should update it. Every call compares the current tip hash with `hashRecentRejectsChainTip`. It is more efficient to have a validation interface callback that updates the rejection filters whenever the chain tip changes.",

That's also why we can only fire `ActiveTipChanged` after releasing the mempool mutex. Later code added to `TxDownloadManager` will call `CTxMemPool` functions that take the mempool lock (see e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30110/files#diff-5d7e42fb1e904f54956c0975a9307c58d8d36d77ad9da8bcd8989437356e3229R264 or grep `exists` within txdownload_impl).",
