    "body": "This addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12754.\r\n\r\nThese changes enable node operators to address the silent dropping (by network middle boxes) of long-lived low-activity ZMQ TCP connections via further operating system level TCP keepalive configuration. For example, ZMQ sockets that publish block hashes can be affected in this way due to the length of time it sometimes takes between finding blocks (e.g.- sometimes more than an hour).\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch, operating system level TCP keepalive configurations would not take effect since the SO_KEEPALIVE option was not enabled on the underlying socket.\r\n\r\nThere are additional ZMQ socket options related to TCP keepalive that can be set. However, I decided not to implement those options in this changeset because doing so would require adding additional bitcoin node configuration options, and would not yield a better outcome. I preferred a small, easily reviewable patch that doesn't add a bunch of new config options, with the tradeoff that the fine tuning would have to be done via well-documented operating system specific configurations.\r\n\r\nI tested this patch by running a node with:\r\n`./src/qt/bitcoin-qt -regtest -txindex -datadir=/tmp/node -zmqpubhashblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332 &`\r\nand connecting to it with:\r\n`python3 ./contrib/zmq/zmq_sub.py`\r\n\r\nWithout these changes, `ss -panto | grep 28332 | grep ESTAB | grep bitcoin` will report no keepalive timer information. With these changes, the output from the prior command will show keepalive timer information consistent with the configuration at the time of connection establishment, e.g.-: `timer:(keepalive,119min,0)`.\r\n\r\nI also tested with a non-TCP transport and did not witness any adverse effects:\r\n`./src/qt/bitcoin-qt -regtest -txindex -datadir=/tmp/node -zmqpubhashblock=ipc:///tmp/bitcoin.block &`\r\n",

Therefore the status of `synced_to_chain` in lnd switched to `false`.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this problem I included this patch into `zmqpublishnotifier.cpp` on top of bitcoind 0.17.1 *and* lowered the tcp_keepalive_time (`sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=60`). Since restarting the patched bitcoind, the connection is stable. \r\n\r\nCrosscheck: I switched to the unpatched 0.18.0rc1 yesterday and after a few minutes bitcoind dropped the zmq connection again. I returned to the patched 0.17.1 and the connection is since stable again.",

      "body": "Just adding some notes from my testing with Windows 10 Home Version 1909 OS build 18363.418 that was downloaded from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO\r\n\r\n```\r\nsha256sum Win10_1909_English_x64.iso\r\n01bf1eb643f7e50d0438f4f74fb91468d35cde2c82b07abc1390d47fc6a356be Win10_1909_English_x64.iso\r\n```\r\n\r\nI cross-compiled using the directions at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn summary, these changes do not affect the Windows 10 regtest Bitcoin node (i.e.- where the Windows Bitcoin node is the ZMQ publisher). I think the reason why is because the libzmq code does not call `setsockopt` with `SO_KEEPALIVE` due to [an old commit in the libzmq repo for Windows](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/797/files). I think that commit should have set the `SIO_KEEPALIVE_VALS` in addition to, not instead of, calling `setsockopt`. I verified that the keep alive packets are not sent when the Windows node has ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE by `tcpdump`ing on a Linux system that was connected to the Windows node as a ZMQ subscriber.\r\n\r\nThese changes are still good for Linux systems. These notes just document how Windows is not affected by this PR because of a bug in the ZMQ library.\r\n\r\nAdditonally, I verified that setting ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE on the subscriber side does work to keep the connections alive and working. Doing that is an alternative to this PR (which sets ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE on the publisher side). The goal is to keep packets going through whatever intermediary has the idle timeout that silently drops the connection. Therefore, the keep alive can be set on either side of the TCP connection to be effective.\r\n\r\nHelpful related links:\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/so-keepalive\r\n- https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/blob/2cb1240db64ce1ea299e00474c646a2453a8435b/src/tcp.cpp#L112-L137\r\n- https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/blob/2cb1240db64ce1ea299e00474c646a2453a8435b/builds/gyp/platform.hpp#L45-L74 (look for ZMQ_HAVE_SO_KEEPALIVE)\r\n- https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/enabling-tcpip-keepalive-windows\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTesting note: the following commands were useful to setup the subscriber side Linux system so that it's firewall would silently drop the connection after 30 seconds of being idle (when ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE was not set [or having the desired effect]).\r\n\r\n```\r\n# set the keep alive packets to go out every second if the sockets are configured to use keep alive\r\nsudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=1\r\nsudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl=1\r\n# setup iptables to drop non-loopback packets that are not in conntrack as being established\r\nsudo /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\r\nsudo /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\r\nsudo /sbin/iptables -P INPUT DROP\r\n# make conntrack forget idle TCP connections after 30 seconds of inactivity\r\n# be sure to run the next command AFTER configuring conntrack in iptables, otherwise the files may not already exist under /proc/sys.\r\nsudo sysctl -w net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_established=30\r\n```\r\n",

This does assume that you're not making these ZMQ connections to a bunch of other external-party system environments where per socket config could be useful. I think this assumption is valid though because I perceive the ZMQ stuff to be for data distribution within one's own (internal) environment. Third parties would be running their own nodes and distributing data from those nodes within their own envs. Make sense?",
