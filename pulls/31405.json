    "body": "Some fields in validation are set opportunistically by \"best effort\":\r\n- The `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` status (which means that the block index has an invalid predecessor)\r\n- `m_best_header` (the most-work header not known to be invalid).\r\n\r\nThis means that there are known situations in which these fields are not set when they should be, or set to wrong values. This is tolerated because the fields are not used for anything consensus-critical and triggering these situations involved creating invalid blocks with valid PoW header, so would have a cost attached. Also, having stricter guarantees for these fields requires iterating over the entire block index, which has some DoS potential, especially with any header above the checkpoint being accepted int he past (see e.g. #11531). \r\n\r\nHowever, there are reasons to change this now:\r\n- RPCs use these fields and can report wrong results\r\n- There is the constant possibility that someone could add code that expects these fields to be correct, especially because it is not well documented that these fields cannot always be relied upon.\r\n- DoS concerns have become less of an issue after #25717 - now an attacker would need to invest much more work because they can't fork off the last checkpoint anymore\r\n\r\nThis PR continues the work from #30666 to ensure that `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` status and `m_best_header` are always correct:\r\n- it adds a call to `InvalidChainFound()` in `AcceptBlock()`.\r\n- it adds checks for `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` and `m_best_header`  to `CheckBlockIndex()`. In order to be able to do this, two more caches were added to the RPC-only `InvalidateBlock()` similar to the existing `candidate_blocks_by_work` for `setBlockIndexCandidates`. These are performance optimizations with the goal of avoiding having a call of `InvalidChainFound()` / looping over the block index after each disconnected block.\r\nI also wrote a fuzz test to find possible edge cases violating `CheckBlockIndex`, which I will PR separately soon.\r\n- it removes the `m_failed_blocks` set, which was a heuristic necessary when we couldn't be sure if a given block index had an invalid predecessor or not. Now that we have that guarantee, the set is no longer needed.",
