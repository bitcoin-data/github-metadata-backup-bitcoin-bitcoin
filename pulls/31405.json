    "body": "Some fields in validation are set opportunistically by \"best effort\":\r\n- The `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` status (which means that the block index has an invalid predecessor)\r\n- `m_best_header` (the most-work header not known to be invalid).\r\n\r\nThis means that there are known situations in which these fields are not set when they should be, or set to wrong values. This is tolerated because the fields are not used for anything consensus-critical and triggering these situations involved creating invalid blocks with valid PoW header, so would have a cost attached. Also, having stricter guarantees for these fields requires iterating over the entire block index, which has some DoS potential, especially with any header above the checkpoint being accepted int he past (see e.g. #11531). \r\n\r\nHowever, there are reasons to change this now:\r\n- RPCs use these fields and can report wrong results\r\n- There is the constant possibility that someone could add code that expects these fields to be correct, especially because it is not well documented that these fields cannot always be relied upon.\r\n- DoS concerns have become less of an issue after #25717 - now an attacker would need to invest much more work because they can't fork off the last checkpoint anymore\r\n\r\nThis PR continues the work from #30666 to ensure that `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` status and `m_best_header` are always correct:\r\n- it adds a call to `InvalidChainFound()` in `AcceptBlock()`.\r\n- it adds checks for `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` and `m_best_header`  to `CheckBlockIndex()`. In order to be able to do this, two more caches were added to the RPC-only `InvalidateBlock()` similar to the existing `candidate_blocks_by_work` for `setBlockIndexCandidates`. These are performance optimizations with the goal of avoiding having a call of `InvalidChainFound()` / looping over the block index after each disconnected block.\r\nI also wrote a fuzz test to find possible edge cases violating `CheckBlockIndex`, which I will PR separately soon.\r\n- it removes the `m_failed_blocks` set, which was a heuristic necessary when we couldn't be sure if a given block index had an invalid predecessor or not. Now that we have that guarantee, the set is no longer needed.",

      "body": "Concept ACK.\r\n\r\nI wrote two test cases to understand the general behavior of `InvalidateBlock`, not specifically to test this PR's changes:\r\n```\r\nA->B->C->D->E->F (main chain)\r\nA->B->C->G (fork 1)\r\nA->B->H->I->J (fork 2)\r\nA->B->H->K (fork 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the [first test](https://github.com/stringintech/bitcoin/blob/1b36dd6a66a44e8756d92e71baa7676646b5f1ce/src/test/validation_block_tests.cpp#L455), I invalidate block C (on active chain) which should invalidate C, D, E, F, and G. The [second test](https://github.com/stringintech/bitcoin/blob/1b36dd6a66a44e8756d92e71baa7676646b5f1ce/src/test/validation_block_tests.cpp#L509) invalidates H (on a fork) which should invalidate H, I, J, and K.\r\n\r\nBoth tests behave the same on the master and PR branches. The first test fails on both because D, E, and F are not marked as `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD`, which I did not expect.\r\n\r\nI have two questions:\r\n\r\n1 )\r\nI found what appears to be a bug in `InvalidateBlock`:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4637cb1eec48d1af8d23eeae1bb4c6f8de55eed9/src/validation.cpp#L3750\r\n\r\nThe first part of the condition seems incorrect and should probably be:\r\n```cpp\r\nif (to_mark_failed->pprev == invalid_walk_tip ...) {\r\n```\r\nThe assertions that fail in the first test are for blocks D, E, and F which were all part of the best chain before invalidation, which led me to this part of the code. I'm not sure if fixing this is in scope for this PR.\r\n\r\n_Update: Just saw the PR #31835 which fixes this issue. :)_\r\n\r\n2 )\r\nTo validate my understanding: Since both branches behave similarly (even on master the `m_best_header` and `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` statuses are set correctly because of the final call to `InvalidChainFound` - except for the ones not set as `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` because of the potential bug), is it correct that the main goal of changes applied in `InvalidateBlock` is to maintain proper block statuses and best header between tip disconnections by marking children as invalid right away and recalculating the best header immediately rather than doing it later?",

The main goal of this PR to add these assumptions to `CheckBlockIndex()` - this means they should always be true when `cs_main` is not held. Since `InvalidateBlock` will release `cs_main` and call `CheckBlockIndex()` after each step, some tests would fail without the changes to `InvalidateBlock()`  - even if the final `InvalidChainFound()` in that function will eventually correct it!",
