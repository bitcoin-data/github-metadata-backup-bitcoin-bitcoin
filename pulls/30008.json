    "body": "The [DNS seeder](https://github.com/achow101/dnsseedrs) that I wrote collects statistics on node reliability in the same way that sipa's seeder does, and also outputs this information in the same file format. Thus it can also be used in our fixed seeds update scripts. My seeder additionally crawls onion v3, i2p, and cjdns, so will now be able to set those fixed seeds automatically rather than curating manual lists.\r\n\r\nIn doing this update, I've found that `makeseeds.py` is missing newer versions from the regex as well as cjdns support; both of these have been updated.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the testnet fixed seeds are all manually curated and sipa's seeder does not appear to publish any testnet data. Since I am also running the seeder for testnet, I've added the commands to generate testnet fixed seeds from my seeder's data too.\r\n\r\nLastly, I've updated all of the fixed seeds. However, since my seeder has not found any cjdns nodes that met the reliability criteria (possibly due to connectivity issues present in those networks), I've left the previous manual seeds for that network.",
