    "body": "This is a first draft implementation of the `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` (`CCV`) opcode.\r\n\r\n`CCV` enables to build Script-based state machines that span across multiple transactions, by providing an ergonomic tool to commit to - and introspect - the Script and possibly some _data_ that is committed inside inputs or outputs.\r\n\r\nRelated to this PR:\r\n- [Draft BIP specifications](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1793).\r\n- [Post on delving bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/op-checkcontractverify-and-its-amount-semantic/1527) focusing on the amount logic of the opcode.\r\n\r\n`CCV` is a general purpose opcode to build state machines based on UTXO; therefore it is not strictly tied to any specific application.\r\n\r\nHowever, as vaults are probably the simplest application of such state machines, the PR also includes a functional test for a very simple (but practical) vault construction, only using `CCV`. More feature-complete vaults are achievable in combinations with other opcodes.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not contain activation logic, and can't be merged as-is, since it would make the opcode immediately active.\r\n\r\nI'd like encourage limiting discussions to the implementation, while specs can be discussed in the BIP draft PR and external places like Delving Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n## Challenges with the cross-input amount logic\r\n\r\nA challenge in implementing `CCV` is the cross-input amount semantic: the opcode adds restrictions on the output amounts that are inherently transaction-wide.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty seems to be common to other possible changes in the working of the Script interpreter (including without new soft forks):\r\n- adding batch validation for Schnorr signatures seems to required a similar shared state, like the `BatchSchnorrVerifier` class using a mutex in this [experimental PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29491). Cross-Input Signature Aggregation would also have the same nature.\r\n- [OP_TXHASH](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/51) used a transaction-wide `TxHashCache`, guarded by a mutex.\r\n- [OP_VAULT](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26857) also has some _deferred checks_ based on information that accumulated during the inputs' Script evaluation.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I added a general purpose `TransactionExecutionData` struct to contain persisting data that is accessible during Script evaluation. This allows the interpreter to cause a failure if either:\r\n- an output's amount is insufficient as per the `CCV` checks across inputs;\r\n- an output is used as a target of two `CCV` checks with incompatible amount semantic.\r\nBy the monotonic nature of these checks, it is impossible that a transaction validity is affected by the order of evaluation of the input Scripts. This is an important property for any usage of the struct in the Script interpreter.\r\n\r\nAs the operations done while the mutex is locked in `CCV` are trivial, it should have a negligible impact on validation. This should, however, be validated with the appropriate benchmarks.\r\n\r\nAlternative approaches to the implementation could be:\r\n- a _deferred checks framework_ like in the OP_VAULT implementation. This is functionally equivalent, but I found the approach slightly harder to implement, and requiring more boilerplate code overall.\r\n- making the Script validation sequential for the inputs of the same transaction (that is, distributing transactions to different worker threads instead of individual inputs). This would make any present and future tx-wide semantic easier and avoid mutexes. However, this refactoring might require bigger changes to the interpreter, and should carefully be benchmarked as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a possibility that changing the semantic of `CCV` somehow might make it possible to implement semantically (or practically) equivalent checks, without requiring explicit sinchronization during input execution. Here's a [gist from darosior](https://gist.github.com/darosior/ae2108ac0bedd3b68ae047af171b2d44) with some early ideas about using the taproot annex for this purpose. At this time, I'm not convinced that this direction is possible without significant tradeoffs - but I have no proof of this, and look forward to your ideas.\r\n\r\n# Related links\r\n\r\n- https://merkle.fun - entry point for the resources under the umbrella of MATT (Merkleize All The Things).\r\n- https://github.com/Merkleize/pymatt - Python framework to explore constructions using `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` (with or without other opcodes).\r\n",
