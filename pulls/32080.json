    "body": "This is a first draft implementation of the `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` (`CCV`) opcode.\r\n\r\n`CCV` enables to build Script-based state machines that span across multiple transactions, by providing an ergonomic tool to commit to - and introspect - the Script and possibly some _data_ that is committed inside inputs or outputs.\r\n\r\nRelated to this PR:\r\n- [Draft BIP specifications](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1793).\r\n- [Post on delving bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/op-checkcontractverify-and-its-amount-semantic/1527) focusing on the amount logic of the opcode.\r\n\r\n`CCV` is a general purpose opcode to build state machines based on UTXO; therefore it is not strictly tied to any specific application.\r\n\r\nHowever, as vaults are probably the simplest application of such state machines, the PR also includes a functional test for a very simple (but practical) vault construction, only using `CCV`. More feature-complete vaults are achievable in combinations with other opcodes.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not contain activation logic, and can't be merged as-is, since it would make the opcode immediately active.\r\n\r\nI'd like encourage limiting discussions to the implementation, while specs can be discussed in the BIP draft PR and external places like Delving Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n## Challenges with the cross-input amount logic\r\n\r\nA challenge in implementing `CCV` is the cross-input amount semantic: the opcode adds restrictions on the output amounts that are inherently transaction-wide.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty seems to be common to other possible changes in the working of the Script interpreter (including without new soft forks):\r\n- adding batch validation for Schnorr signatures seems to require a similar shared state, like the `BatchSchnorrVerifier` class using a mutex in this [experimental PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29491). Cross-Input Signature Aggregation would also have the same nature.\r\n- [OP_TXHASH](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/51) used a transaction-wide `TxHashCache`, guarded by a mutex.\r\n- [OP_VAULT](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26857) also has some _deferred checks_ based on information that accumulated during the inputs' Script evaluation.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I added a general purpose `TransactionExecutionData` struct to contain persisting data that is accessible during Script evaluation. This allows the interpreter to cause a failure if either:\r\n- an output's amount is insufficient as per the `CCV` checks across inputs;\r\n- an output is used as a target of two `CCV` checks with incompatible amount semantic.\r\n\r\nBy the monotonic nature of these checks, it is impossible that a transaction validity is affected by the order of evaluation of the input Scripts. This is an important property for any usage of the struct in the Script interpreter.\r\n\r\nAs the operations done while the mutex is locked in `CCV` are trivial, it should have a negligible impact on validation. This should, however, be validated with the appropriate benchmarks.\r\n\r\nAlternative approaches to the implementation could be:\r\n- a _deferred checks framework_ like in the OP_VAULT implementation. This is functionally equivalent, but I found the approach slightly harder to implement, and requiring more boilerplate code overall.\r\n- making the Script validation sequential for the inputs of the same transaction (that is, distributing transactions to different worker threads instead of individual inputs). This would make any present and future tx-wide semantic easier and avoid mutexes. However, this refactoring might require bigger changes to the interpreter, and should carefully be benchmarked as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a possibility that changing the semantic of `CCV` somehow might make it possible to implement semantically (or practically) equivalent checks, without requiring explicit sinchronization during input execution. Here's a [gist from darosior](https://gist.github.com/darosior/ae2108ac0bedd3b68ae047af171b2d44) with some early ideas about using the taproot annex for this purpose. At this time, I'm not convinced that this direction is possible without significant tradeoffs - but I have no proof of this, and look forward to your ideas.\r\n\r\n# Related links\r\n\r\n- https://merkle.fun - entry point for the resources under the umbrella of MATT (Merkleize All The Things).\r\n- https://github.com/Merkleize/pymatt - Python framework to explore constructions using `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` (with or without other opcodes).\r\n",

That way there's only two key sets needed for a vault: one hot, one cold. And you're avoiding the use of a NUMS point.\r\n\r\nBIP 345 (`OP_VAULT`) says:\r\n\r\n> the recovery key can include a number of spending conditions, e.g. a time-delayed fallback to an \"easier\" recovery method, in case the highly secure key winds up being too highly secure.\r\n\r\nIn your scheme you can have those recovery options in the main taptree. That allows for recovery without an initial trigger transaction / unvaulting, i.e. even if you lost the hot key (I think BIP 345 allows that too?).",

Maybe to provide an example of having two `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` codes in a single leaf?  The `trigger_and_revault` leaf already does that.\r\n\r\nIt could still make sense to have an example of a more advanced vault, but it should be seperate. The simplest possible vault is a good way to learn how this opcode works.",

      "body": "Thanks for checking out the demo!\r\nFor the naming, I tried to use names similar to BIP-345, except that I name the \"Vault\" and \"Unvaulting\" state of the FSM which seems more natural in CCV-lingo (where you define the multi-utxo contract as a finite-state-machine).\r\n\r\n> Can `alternate_pk` and `recover_pk` just be the same? That way there's only two key sets needed for a vault: one hot, one cold. And you're avoiding the use of a NUMS point.\r\n\r\nYou could, but I don't think that makes a lot of sense in practice, as the `alternate_pk` has no covenant restriction. I think in simple vaults it doesn't make sense to use the `alternate_pk`; you could only make sense to use it for deep cold storage (e.g. a musig of cold keys, that is: \"you can override the 2-step withdrawal process, but you have to go through the hassle of using multiple cold keys\").\r\nNote that using the alternate pubkey makes the default spending paths more expensive, since NUMS has the special encoding `0` in CCV - so one might still prefer to use a NUMS in the keypath and put a `pk(alternate_pk)` in a tapleaf.\r\n\r\nIn general, I don't think the `alternate_pk` is very interesting for a vault, but it comes natural to define it because of how taproot works.\r\n\r\nThe keypath is certainly more interesting in multi-party contracts, where the parties can cooperatively agree to sign the transaction with a musig taproot keypath, instead of putting the covenant on-chain.\r\n\r\n> In your scheme you can have those recovery options in the main taptree. That allows for recovery without an initial trigger transaction / unvaulting, i.e. even if you lost the hot key (I think BIP 345 allows that too?).\r\n\r\nYes, in the demo I made a simple recovery mechanism that sends to a predetermined address, but you can of course get arbitrarily more creative if you wish!\r\n\r\n\r\n> I tried to be smart and also use `-1` instead of `cold_pk` in `recover_leaf`, but that doesn't work. Not sure why.\r\n\r\nPutting `-1` means in the `pk` argument means that you reuse the taproot internal key for your output, which you probably only want to do in a recursive contract (but then like you probably also want to put `-1` for the taptree, like the first `CCV` in the `trigger_and_revault` leaf, that recycles both the internal key and the taptree in order to 'send back to yourself').",

      "body": "The 'trigger' transaction moves from the Vault state to the Unvaulting state.\r\n- a Vault UTXO has no embedded data, so the internal key equals what I called the _naked key_ (which is the `alternate_pk` in this case).\r\n- an Unvaulting UTXO has some data embedded (the withdrawal_pk), so the internal key is something like `tweak(alternate_pk, SHA256(alternate_pk || data))`. So if you put `-1` to send to an output with the \"same public key as the input's internal key\", you'd have the tweaked key as the output. Which is still spendable if you control `alternate_pk`, but probably not what you wanted.\r\n\r\nIf you _really_ wanted to \"send to an output with the same naked key as the input you're spending, you could pass _naked key_, _data_ and _taptree_, then do a CCV check on the input (with `CCV_FLAG_CHECK_INPUT`) to check it matches what's on the stack, then do a CCV on the output (now that you have the naked key on the stack). But I think you don't want to do this.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, working with directed acyclic graphs (meaning, the construction always moves forward, and introspection on the input is only used to get the input's data on the stack), so far, seems to be enough to do anything interesting.\r\n\r\nRecursive contracts are the exception, where you send to _exactly_ the same `(naked_key, taptree)` pair as the input, either with no data (like in vaults), or after updating the data with some new data (this will be useful in shared UTXOs, sidechains, etc.).",
