See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

      "message": "Add txids with non-standard inputs to reject filter\n\nOur policy checks for non-standard inputs depend only on the non-witness\nportion of a transaction: we look up the scriptPubKey of the input being\nspent from our UTXO set (which is covered by the input txid), and the p2sh\nchecks only rely on the scriptSig portion of the input.\n\nConsequently it's safe to add txids of transactions that fail these checks to\nthe reject filter, as the witness is irrelevant to the failure. This is helpful\nfor any situation where we might request the transaction again via txid (either\nfrom txid-relay peers, or if we might fetch the transaction via txid due to\nparent-fetching of orphans).\n\nFurther, in preparation for future witness versions being deployed on the\nnetwork, ensure that WITNESS_UNKNOWN transactions are rejected in\nAreInputsStandard(), so that transactions spending v1 (or greater) witness\noutputs will fall into this category of having their txid added to the reject\nfilter.\n\nGithub-Pull: #19620\nRebased-From: 7989901c7eb62ca28b3d1e5d5831041a7267e495",
