    "body": "I worked with Travis to get the cache flag on my personal repo for testing, and I'm happy to report that all works great (after a day of churning builds).\n\nFor some background: Travis has enabled caching for their new infrastructure, but the feature is brand new and not yet generally available. For now it requires a special flag (set on their end) on your repo. Once they're satisfied with its stability, the flag will be granted to everyone. Note that the flag comes with the caveat of invalidating all current caches. That's not a problem for us, other than slowing things down for a few hours. I was primarily worried about unintended side-effects of opting in, so I added it on my own repo for testing before requesting it here.\n\nIf there's no reason to delay our move, I'll request the flag for this repo tomorrow (4/21). \n\nOnce that's take care of, we can merge this for Trusty goodness. On the day that Xenial is scheduled to be released :p.\n\nNext step is c++11, which should be painless to enable now.\n\nNote that this includes #7792, otherwise the OSX build fails. @laanwj I'm happy to rebase if you'd prefer to merge that first.\n",

      "body": "@MarcoFalke Just for the sake of being future-proof. It only uses the python2 one at the moment, but I believe the (your?) intention is to move the rpc tests to python3. Just doing python2 for now is fine by me if that's what you'd prefer. I was just saving some future head-scratching when builds fail after the switch.\n\nEdit: Looking at the diff, I now see why you asked. Python was a headache when testing the migration from precise->trusty. I had a theory at one point that python3 was being forced for the rpc tests, which obviously turned out to not be the case. But I left it there since that's where we're headed.\n",

In theory, precise caches will be regenerated for subsequent PRs, but I'm nervous about that actually happening seamlessly on the deprecated platform.\n\nEven if it does work without issue, PRs will be slow until _something_ is pushed into master. When a PR is created, the build cache is taken from its source branch (master), and copied into the PR. From there, the PR updates its own cache with each update.\n\nRight now we have no master cache, and no PR caches. So until there's something to pull from master, each PR will be rebuilding from scratch. Also, once we _do_ pull the trigger on this, it will essentially invalidate all caches again, because all dependencies will be rebuilt for the new toolchains.\n\ntl;dr: Need to push _something_ into master asap to avoid slow builds all day. May as well push this one, to avoid a repeat.\n",
