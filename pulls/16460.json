Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n",

While it's correct, it's at least a code smell because the code clears the memory twice on MSVC.

Is wallet being used by another process?\" if the wallet file permissions are read-only.\n\n  Goals:\n\n  1. Reproduce the reported issue, define the current unexpected behavior, and add test coverage to guide a future fix. Add debug-level logging for sanity checking and commented-out assertions to be uncommented when fixing the issue. Add the same coverage to the wallet tool create test and the getwalletinfo test as regression tests while fixing the issue.\n\n  2.

Is wallet being used by another process?\" if the wallet file permissions are read-only.\n\n  Goals:\n\n  1. Reproduce the reported issue, define the current unexpected behavior, and add test coverage to guide a future fix. Add debug-level logging for sanity checking and commented-out assertions to be uncommented when fixing the issue. Add the same coverage to the wallet tool create test and the getwalletinfo test as regression tests while fixing the issue.\n\n  2. Add info log messages as there are currently none in the test file.\n\n  3. Split the tests out to separate functions as per review feedback.\n\n  Thanks to Marco Falke for pointing me in the right direction.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  laanwj:\n    code review ACK 7195fa792fcc19e9c064c4e38814c3b46a210b34\n\nTree-SHA512: 16a41cce989c8f819cf5b02c6cf8ea84653ede2738fb402f6c36cf4dc075b424dff3e2c73a1cfa1ec9c75f614675baecc71e588845a2596db06ba0957db2df7b",

Use this [latest update link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-497303718) to see what's new.**~~\n\n  Please read the `README.md`.\n\n  -----\n\n  ### Guix Introduction\n\n  This PR enables building bitcoin in Guix containers. [Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Features.html) is a transactional package manager much like Nix, but unlike Nix, it has more of a focus on [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html) and [reproducibility](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/blog/tags/reproducible-builds/) which are attractive for security-sensitive projects like bitcoin.\n\n  ### Guix Build Walkthrough\n\n  Please read the `README.md`.\n\n  [Old instructions no. 4](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-497303718)\n\n  [Old instructions no. 3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-493827011)\n\n  [Old instructions no. 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-471658439)\n\n  <details>\n  <summary>Old instructions no. 1</summary>\n  In this PR, we define a Guix [manifest](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-package.html#profile_002dmanifest) in `contrib/guix/manifest.scm`, which declares what packages we want in our environment.\n\n  We can then invoke\n  ```\n  guix environment --manifest=contrib/guix/manifest.scm --container --pure --no-grafts --no-substitutes\n  ```\n  To have Guix:\n  1. Build an environment containing the packages we defined in our `contrib/guix/manifest.scm` manifest from the Guix bootstrap binaries (see [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html) for more details).\n  2. Start a container with that environment that has no network access, and no access to the host's filesystem except to the `pwd` that it was started in.\n  3. Drop you into a shell in that container.\n\n  > Note: if you don't want to wait hours for Guix to build the entire world from scratch, you can eliminate the `--no-substitutes` option to have Guix download from available binary sources. Note that this convenience doesn't necessarily compromise your security, as you can check that a package was built correctly after the fact using `guix build --check <packagename>`\n\n  Therefore, we can perform a build of bitcoin much like in Gitian by invoking the following:\n\n  ```\n  make -C depends -j\"$(nproc)\" download && \\\n      cat contrib/guix/build.sh | guix environment --manifest=contrib/guix/manifest.scm --container --pure --no-grafts --no-substitutes\n  ```\n\n  We don't include `make -C depends -j\"$(nproc)\" download` inside `contrib/guix/build.sh` because `contrib/guix/build.sh` is run inside the container, which has no network access (which is a good thing).\n  </details>\n\n  ### Rationale\n\n  I believe that this represents a substantial improvement for the \"supply chain security\" of bitcoin because:\n\n  1. We no longer have to rely on Ubuntu for our build environment for our releases ([oh the horror](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/72bd4ab867e3be0d8410403d9641c08288d343e3/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml#L10)), because Guix builds everything about the container, we can perform this on almost any Linux distro/system.\n  2. It is now much easier to determine what trusted binaries are in our supply chain, and even make a nice visualization! (see [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html)).\n  3. There is active effort among Guix folks to minimize the number of trusted binaries even further. OriansJ's [stage0](https://github.com/oriansj/stage0), and janneke's [Mes](https://www.gnu.org/software/mes/) all aim to achieve [reduced binary boostrap](http://joyofsource.com/reduced-binary-seed-bootstrap.html) for Guix. In fact, I believe if OriansJ gets his way, we will end up some day with only a single trusted binary: hex0 (a ~500 byte self-hosting hex assembler).\n\n  ### Steps to Completion\n\n  - [x] Successfully build bitcoin inside the Guix environment\n  - [x] Make `check-symbols` pass\n  - [x] Do the above but without nasty hacks\n  - [x] Solve some of the more innocuous hacks\n  - [ ] Make it cross-compile (HELP WANTED HERE)\n    - [x] Linux\n      - [x] x86_64-linux-gnu\n      - [x] i686-linux-gnu\n      - [x] aarch64-linux-gnu\n      - [x] arm-linux-gnueabihf\n      - [x] riscv64-linux-gnu\n    - [ ] OS X\n      - [ ] x86_64-apple-darwin14\n    - [ ] Windows\n      - [ ] x86_64-w64-mingw32\n  - [ ] Maybe make importer for depends syntax\n  - [ ] Document build process for future releases\n  - [ ] Extra: Pin the revision of Guix that we build with with Guix [inferiors](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Inferiors.html)\n\n  ### Help Wanted\n\n  [Old content no. 3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-483318210)\n\n  [Old content no. 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-471658439)\n\n  <details>\n  <summary>Old content no. 1</summary>\n  As of now, the command described above to perform a build of bitcoin a lot like Gitian works, but fails at the `check-symbols` stage. This is because a few dynamic libraries are linked in that shouldn't be.\n\n  Here's what `ldd src/bitcoind` looks like when built in a Guix container:\n  ```\n  \tlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcc2d90000)\n  \tlibdl.so.2 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fb7eda09000)\n  \tlibrt.so.1 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007fb7ed9ff000)\n  \tlibstdc++.so.6 => /gnu/store/4sqps8dczv3g7rwbdibfz6rf5jlk7w90-gcc-5.5.0-lib/lib/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007fb7ed87c000)\n  \tlibpthread.so.0 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fb7ed85b000)\n  \tlibm.so.6 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007fb7ed6da000)\n  \tlibgcc_s.so.1 => /gnu/store/4sqps8dczv3g7rwbdibfz6rf5jlk7w90-gcc-5.5.0-lib/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fb7ed6bf000)\n  \tlibc.so.6 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb7ed506000)\n  \t/gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb7ee3a0000)\n  ```\n\n  And here's what it looks in one of our releases:\n  ```\n  \tlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffff52cd000)\n  \tlibpthread.so.0 => /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f87726b4000)\n  \tlibrt.so.1 => /usr/lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007f87726aa000)\n  \tlibm.so.6 => /usr/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007f8772525000)\n  \tlibgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f877250b000)\n  \tlibc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f8772347000)\n  \t/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f8773392000)\n  ```\n\n  ~~I suspect it is because my script does not apply the gitian-input patches [described in the release process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-process.md#fetch-and-create-inputs-first-time-or-when-dependency-versions-change) but there is no description as to how these patches are applied.~~ It might also be something else entirely.\n\n  Edit: It is something else. It appears that the gitian inputs are only used by [`gitian-win-signer.yml`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d6e700e40f861ddd6743f4d13f0d6f6bc19093c2/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml#L14)\n  </details>\n\n  ### How to Help\n\n  1. Install Guix on your distro either [from source](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) or perform a [binary installation](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html#Binary-Installation)\n  2.

Use this [latest update link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-497303718) to see what's new.**~~\n\n  Please read the `README.md`.\n\n  -----\n\n  ### Guix Introduction\n\n  This PR enables building bitcoin in Guix containers. [Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Features.html) is a transactional package manager much like Nix, but unlike Nix, it has more of a focus on [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html) and [reproducibility](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/blog/tags/reproducible-builds/) which are attractive for security-sensitive projects like bitcoin.\n\n  ### Guix Build Walkthrough\n\n  Please read the `README.md`.\n\n  [Old instructions no. 4](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-497303718)\n\n  [Old instructions no. 3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-493827011)\n\n  [Old instructions no. 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-471658439)\n\n  <details>\n  <summary>Old instructions no. 1</summary>\n  In this PR, we define a Guix [manifest](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-package.html#profile_002dmanifest) in `contrib/guix/manifest.scm`, which declares what packages we want in our environment.\n\n  We can then invoke\n  ```\n  guix environment --manifest=contrib/guix/manifest.scm --container --pure --no-grafts --no-substitutes\n  ```\n  To have Guix:\n  1. Build an environment containing the packages we defined in our `contrib/guix/manifest.scm` manifest from the Guix bootstrap binaries (see [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html) for more details).\n  2. Start a container with that environment that has no network access, and no access to the host's filesystem except to the `pwd` that it was started in.\n  3. Drop you into a shell in that container.\n\n  > Note: if you don't want to wait hours for Guix to build the entire world from scratch, you can eliminate the `--no-substitutes` option to have Guix download from available binary sources. Note that this convenience doesn't necessarily compromise your security, as you can check that a package was built correctly after the fact using `guix build --check <packagename>`\n\n  Therefore, we can perform a build of bitcoin much like in Gitian by invoking the following:\n\n  ```\n  make -C depends -j\"$(nproc)\" download && \\\n      cat contrib/guix/build.sh | guix environment --manifest=contrib/guix/manifest.scm --container --pure --no-grafts --no-substitutes\n  ```\n\n  We don't include `make -C depends -j\"$(nproc)\" download` inside `contrib/guix/build.sh` because `contrib/guix/build.sh` is run inside the container, which has no network access (which is a good thing).\n  </details>\n\n  ### Rationale\n\n  I believe that this represents a substantial improvement for the \"supply chain security\" of bitcoin because:\n\n  1. We no longer have to rely on Ubuntu for our build environment for our releases ([oh the horror](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/72bd4ab867e3be0d8410403d9641c08288d343e3/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml#L10)), because Guix builds everything about the container, we can perform this on almost any Linux distro/system.\n  2. It is now much easier to determine what trusted binaries are in our supply chain, and even make a nice visualization! (see [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html)).\n  3. There is active effort among Guix folks to minimize the number of trusted binaries even further. OriansJ's [stage0](https://github.com/oriansj/stage0), and janneke's [Mes](https://www.gnu.org/software/mes/) all aim to achieve [reduced binary boostrap](http://joyofsource.com/reduced-binary-seed-bootstrap.html) for Guix. In fact, I believe if OriansJ gets his way, we will end up some day with only a single trusted binary: hex0 (a ~500 byte self-hosting hex assembler).\n\n  ### Steps to Completion\n\n  - [x] Successfully build bitcoin inside the Guix environment\n  - [x] Make `check-symbols` pass\n  - [x] Do the above but without nasty hacks\n  - [x] Solve some of the more innocuous hacks\n  - [ ] Make it cross-compile (HELP WANTED HERE)\n    - [x] Linux\n      - [x] x86_64-linux-gnu\n      - [x] i686-linux-gnu\n      - [x] aarch64-linux-gnu\n      - [x] arm-linux-gnueabihf\n      - [x] riscv64-linux-gnu\n    - [ ] OS X\n      - [ ] x86_64-apple-darwin14\n    - [ ] Windows\n      - [ ] x86_64-w64-mingw32\n  - [ ] Maybe make importer for depends syntax\n  - [ ] Document build process for future releases\n  - [ ] Extra: Pin the revision of Guix that we build with with Guix [inferiors](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Inferiors.html)\n\n  ### Help Wanted\n\n  [Old content no. 3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-483318210)\n\n  [Old content no. 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-471658439)\n\n  <details>\n  <summary>Old content no. 1</summary>\n  As of now, the command described above to perform a build of bitcoin a lot like Gitian works, but fails at the `check-symbols` stage. This is because a few dynamic libraries are linked in that shouldn't be.\n\n  Here's what `ldd src/bitcoind` looks like when built in a Guix container:\n  ```\n  \tlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcc2d90000)\n  \tlibdl.so.2 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fb7eda09000)\n  \tlibrt.so.1 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007fb7ed9ff000)\n  \tlibstdc++.so.6 => /gnu/store/4sqps8dczv3g7rwbdibfz6rf5jlk7w90-gcc-5.5.0-lib/lib/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007fb7ed87c000)\n  \tlibpthread.so.0 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fb7ed85b000)\n  \tlibm.so.6 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007fb7ed6da000)\n  \tlibgcc_s.so.1 => /gnu/store/4sqps8dczv3g7rwbdibfz6rf5jlk7w90-gcc-5.5.0-lib/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fb7ed6bf000)\n  \tlibc.so.6 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb7ed506000)\n  \t/gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb7ee3a0000)\n  ```\n\n  And here's what it looks in one of our releases:\n  ```\n  \tlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffff52cd000)\n  \tlibpthread.so.0 => /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f87726b4000)\n  \tlibrt.so.1 => /usr/lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007f87726aa000)\n  \tlibm.so.6 => /usr/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007f8772525000)\n  \tlibgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f877250b000)\n  \tlibc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f8772347000)\n  \t/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f8773392000)\n  ```\n\n  ~~I suspect it is because my script does not apply the gitian-input patches [described in the release process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-process.md#fetch-and-create-inputs-first-time-or-when-dependency-versions-change) but there is no description as to how these patches are applied.~~ It might also be something else entirely.\n\n  Edit: It is something else. It appears that the gitian inputs are only used by [`gitian-win-signer.yml`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d6e700e40f861ddd6743f4d13f0d6f6bc19093c2/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml#L14)\n  </details>\n\n  ### How to Help\n\n  1. Install Guix on your distro either [from source](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) or perform a [binary installation](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html#Binary-Installation)\n  2. Try out my branch and the command described above!\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  MarcoFalke:\n    Thanks for the replies.

This behavior is analogous to the \"break;\" statement.\n\n  This can be tested by running the following with and without this change:\n  ```sh\n  bitcoind -- -regtest -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -listen=1 -bind=127.0.0.1 -whitebind=127.0.0.1:0\n  ```\n\n  Fixes #16376.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  laanwj:\n    code review ACK a981e749e6553487cd48eda28e590f769e81c85c\n  fanquake:\n    ACK a981e749e6553487cd48eda28e590f769e81c85c\n\nTree-SHA512: 328fe71366404d5be8177d7081d5b4868cee73412df631a1865d24fb1c153427210762738109e06b737f037f4c68966812fba041831bb9e8129861f19ce61a63",

(Matt Corallo)\n\nPull request description:\n\n  BIP 37 bloom filters have been well-known to be a significant DoS\n  target for some time. However, in order to provide continuity for\n  SPV clients relying on it, the NODE_BLOOM service flag was added,\n  and left as a default, to ensure sufficient nodes exist with such a\n  flag.\n\n  NODE_BLOOM is, at this point, well-established and, as long as\n  there exist 0.18 nodes with default config (which I'd anticipate\n  will be true for many years), will be available from some peers. By\n  that time, the continued slowdown of BIP 37-based filtering will\n  likely have rendered it useless (though this is already largely the\n  case). Further, BIP 37 was deliberately never updated to support\n  witness-based filtering as newer wallets are expected to migrate to\n  some yet-to-be-network-exposed filters.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  jnewbery:\n    ACK bead32e31e399090af30b2ee3539995d4105a66d\n  kallewoof:\n    ACK bead32e31e399090af30b2ee3539995d4105a66d\n\nTree-SHA512: ecd901898e8efe1a7c82b471af0acc2373c2282ac633eb58d9aae7c35deda1999d0f79fb0485e6cecbda7246aeda00206cd82c7fa36866e2ac64705ba93f9390\n",

Didn't bother to review the test in detail, it looked fine. Debated whether invalidateblock should ever crash the node, but *not* crashing in the case of hitting a pruned block (which is the only change here) is clearly better, even if there are other cases I'd argue we should crash in.\n  ryanofsky:\n    utACK a47df13471e3168e2e02023fb20cdf2414141b36. Only change since last review is new comment.\n  promag:\n    ACK a47df1347, it takes awhile to quit (RPC connection timeouts) but that's unrelated - hope to fix that soon.\n  fanquake:\n    ACK a47df13471e3168e2e02023fb20cdf2414141b36\n\nTree-SHA512: 4dec8cef6e7dbbe513c138fc5821a7ceab855e603ece3c16185b51a3830ab7ebbc844a28827bf64e75326f45325991dcb672f13bd7baede53304f27289c4af8d",
