    "body": "This PR introduces the ability to import BIP32 master seeds alongside xpubs. It currently expects seeds to be provided in [BIP 93/codex32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0093.mediawiki) either as a single seed or as a list of shares which can be assembled via Shamir Secret Sharing.\r\n\r\nIt could be generalized to other seed formats, e.g. a hex-encoding or the old `sethdseeds` WIF format, easily enough by just attempting to parse the input in those formats and retrying until we find one that works. (Though we must be extremely careful that these formats are unambiguous! If the user imports a seed they don't expect, which fails to match the one they've backed up, the result could be coin loss. For formats with no prefix or checksum, e.g. hex-encoded bytes, we may need to require the user provide a prefix or a separate flag.)\r\n\r\nThe motivation here is that users who are importing their coins from another wallet likely have them in the form of a public descriptor (probably one of the standard `pkh(BIP44/48/84/whatever)` ones) along with a master seed (probably in some seed word format, but this is easy enough to convert to a straight BIP32 seed with an external tool). The seed, presumably, they want to minimize handling of, while the descriptor they are likely to be copy/pasting from somewhere and generally being less careful with.\r\n\r\nTo import this into Core, they currently need to construct a version of their descriptor in which xpubs are replaced by xprivs, and import that. This is cumbersome and potentially dangerous. With this extra RPC flag they are able to separately tweak their descriptor however they need, and then adding their seed data, unmodified, at the last minute in one place.\r\n\r\nMy specific use case is: I have an estate planning document which contains careful instructions for reconstructing seed data from shares which are stored separately and externally to the planning document. Meanwhile, the document itself contains a public descriptor, with checksum already computed, which is stored in several locations accessible by an open-ended set of people. If I were forced to mix the secret data with the public data, it would increase the risk of leaking the secrets as well as the risk of losing the public part.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Other approaches, that I considered but chose not to take:\r\n\r\n* Extend the existing `sethdseed` RPC. This RPC is legacy-only and not supported by descriptor wallets, because it depends on the legacy \"bag of keys\" model where you could stick keys into the wallet and it'd \"just work\", often in surprising ways.\r\n* Add a new descriptor-wallet-based `importseed` RPC or something. This doesn't work for more-or-less the same reason; the descriptor wallet associates all its keys with `ScriptPubKeyManager`s, so we would need to add support for \"global keys\" somehow. This is a lot of work, lots of room for bikeshedding, and I worry that @achow101 will NACK anything that looks too much like a \"bag of keys\" model. (The situation would be much less bad than the legacy one, where 3rd parties could do stuff like mapping p2wpkh addresses to p2pkh ones and the wallet would just accept it ... but it would still potentially lead to user confusion about what exact conditions the wallet could sign for what descriptors, and it may constrain future wallet changes.)\r\n* Adding a `codex32(...)/1/2/3` xpriv format to the descriptor import format. This was suggested to me by @sipa and has the benefit that very closely matches the existing import model.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't like the latter\r\n* for the reasons stated in the PR description -- I like my descriptors to be public, and my secret data to be limited to 16 bytes, and I think this is a common mode of operation for people coming from other wallets\r\n* ...and maybe worse, a common model for other wallet authors, who would refuse to nicely interoperate with this);\r\n* because it felt like enough of a change to deserve a change to one of the descriptor BIPs, but those are big enough already and it's hard to get tiny changes to propagate to all implementors of standards. Plus it felt wrong to couple codex32 with descriptors like this.i\r\n* because if you have multiple descirptors that use the same seed, it would force you to copy the seed multiple times, which is dangerous. (In some cases [BIP 389](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1354) will make this better, but it doesn't cover everything and anyway is not accepted or implemented yet. One thing at a time :))\r\n\r\nBut what cinched it, and made me switch to the approach in the PR, was that @roconnor-blockstream pointed out to me that the codex32 model means that you can't predict, at writing-down-the-descriptor time, exactly what shares you'll be inputting. And because descriptors have a checksum which covers their entire string encoding, this means that you can't predict ahead-of-timei what will go into the `codex32(...)` slot and therefore what the total checksum ought to be. And this means that either (a) you lose the descriptor checksum, which is a Bad Idea and also inconvenient for importers who' will have to construct a checksum with `getdescriptorinfo` to get `importdescriptors` to accept it, even though said checksum had never been used to protect data in storage; or (b) you modify the descriptor checksum algorithm to be aware of `codex(...)` and to skip checksumming the data inside of that. This means even more implementation complexity that other wallets are unlikely to bring in, plus the result generalizes less easily to other seed formats (e.g. hex) which don't have checksums of their own.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> This RPC (`sethdseed`) is legacy-only and not supported by descriptor wallets\r\n\r\nGreat point, I had forgotten about this\r\n\r\n> for the reasons stated in the PR description -- I like my descriptors to be public, and my secret data to be limited to 16 bytes, and I think this is a common mode of operation for people coming from other wallets\r\n\r\nThis is a very compelling argument, and your approach seems like the path of least resistance towards supporting this use case.\r\n\r\n> the descriptor wallet associates all its keys with ScriptPubKeyManagers, so we would need to add support for \"global keys\" somehow. This is a lot of work, lots of room for bikeshedding\r\n\r\nLongterm, I think it would be great to look into a more comprehensive solution which addresses the above\r\n\r\nEDIT: I'd suggest adding your comment to the description; it really helps in understanding why you're taking this approach",

      "body": "Concept ACK. I think we should definitely support the described use case.\r\n\r\nFor the approach, I think we already have some implementation ready for the second alternative you mentioned. #26728 adds support for a wallet master key (I think this is what you meant by \"global keys\"). And #23544 by @Sjors, built on top of it, adds a RPC for descriptor wallets similar to `sethdseed`.\r\n\r\nI like the alternative better because it support more use cases:\r\n\r\n1. storing wallet master key allows you to generate new descriptors for the existing master key, e.g. to add `tr` descriptors to existing wallet\r\n2. better support for multisig between core and a hardware wallet (described in #23544)",

We may even want both, since the functionality here is slightly different (rather than importing global seeds, it allows importing a specific set of descriptors which share one seed, without affecting others).",

Then, deprecate the latter fields, which represent all the remaining RPC `warning` fields.\r\n\r\nThe first commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27279/commits/f73782a9032a462a71569e9424db9bf9eeababf3 implements https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27138#issuecomment-1474789198 as an alternative to #27138.

          "body": "UPDATE: In an attempt to make reviewing a bit more sane, I'm breaking this up into a few smaller PRs, but will keep this one open as the parent PR and keep it rebased on the child PRs.\r\n\r\nMarking as a draft for now. The main purpose of having this PR is to track progress on child PRs and also have an easy way to compile `bitcoind` with both send and receive support for testing. Additionally, I'll be adding more functional tests to this PR since its much easier to test when `bitcoind` can both send and receive.\r\n\r\n## Milestones\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122 implements the BIP logic and unit tests, ready for review\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201 implements sending in the Bitcoin Core wallet\r\n  - depends on #28122\r\n  - Ready for review, but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28202 implements receiving in the Bitcoin Core wallet\r\n  - depends on #28122\r\n  - Ready for review but marked as a draft until dependencies are merged\r\n\r\n## This PR\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the basic silent payments scheme. In particular:\r\n\r\n* Adds support for existing wallets to send to silent payment addresses\r\n* Adds support to the Bitcoin Core wallet for receiving silent payments\r\n\r\nThe following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Creating multiple outputs for the same silent payment address when sending\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `send` is covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to an indexer, such as electrum server)\r\n* Add benchmarks to validate that there are no DoS concerns for doing silent payment verification for transactions in the mempool\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897, where most of the follow-ups I mention above have already been fully or partially implemented.\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458\r\n\r\n## Notes for the reviewers\r\n\r\nThere are a few parts of this PR that need re-working but are implementation details and not specific to how silent payments work. I decided to open the PR as-is so that folks reviewing the BIP have an implementation to look at and to get some suggestions on how to better implement this in the wallet. Specifically, I'm looking for feedback on how to improve the following:\r\n\r\n* The `sp()` descriptor should be updated to implement the BIP and independently derive the scan key (currently it's just a hash of the spend key)\r\n* Both the spend and scan key are kept in their own object, it would be nice to have them only accessed through the descriptor. Another idea would be allow scanning even if the wallet is encrypted, so that the spend key is not accessible unless spending\r\n* Each silent payment output found is added to the wallet as a `rawtr` descriptor. Ideally, we have a new descriptor that takes the spend key and then stores the auxiliary data needed to construct the private key (e.g `sp(spend_key, <one of hash(ecdh_shared_secret>)`\r\n* Some of the methods could probably be better organized (e.g implemented on the SPKMan, when it could be a wallet method)",

For the full PR with wallet logic, take a look at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27827 .\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",
