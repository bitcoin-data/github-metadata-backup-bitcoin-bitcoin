    "body": "Previously the `utxoupdatepsbt` RPC, added in #13932, only updated the inputs spending segwit outputs with the `witness_utxo`, because the full transaction is needed for legacy inputs. Before this RPC looked for just the utxos in the utxo set and the mempool. This PR makes it so that if the user has txindex enabled, then the full transaction is looked for there for all inputs. If it is not found in the txindex or  txindex isn't enabled, then the mempool is checked for the full transaction. If the transaction an input is spending from is still not found at that point, then the utxo set is searched and the inputs spending segwit outputs are updated with just the utxo.",

When I was reviewing this, I was first trying to find out what `non_witness_utxos` and `witness_utxos` were, when we needed them, and finally learned per the previous PR when we could drop them. My understanding is that we can only drop `non_witness_utxos` when all inputs are segwit v1.\r\n\r\nI would suspect that we might also be able to drop `witness_utxos` on non-segwit inputs when we do have the corresponding `non_witness_utxos`, and vice versa, drop the `non_witness_utxos` on segwit inputs, if we do have the `witness_utxos` for them. Is that accurate?\r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\n/** Reduces the size of the PSBT by dropping unnecessary `non_witness_utxos` (i.e. previous transactions) from a psbt when all inputs are segwit v1. */\r\n```",

Even if this is not the case, changing this behavior would be out of the scope of this PR. ",
