Ive looked at it in valgrind and gprofile and tried changing some possible culprits and havent had any luck tracking it down.  _If anyone tracks it down, Ill owe you big time._~~\n**Additionally, please mind the removal of cs_main around stuff thats not in main.cpp (esp rpc) and tell me Im wrong to do that.**\n",

While I was benchmarking bitcoin built in debug vs release (for gitian stuff), I noticed there was a bit of a performance decrease when built in debug mode.  As it turns out, I had always been benchmarking CBlockStore in debug mode.  When ff66202 is removed and CBlockStore is benchmarked, it has the slight performance improvement over master that would be expected.\n",
