    "body": "This is the full version with all debug added. It should help to make debug.log more concise and enable certain areas of interest to be {,de}activated.\n\nThis should help developers who need to enable debugging to determine what is happening allowing block and tx to be debugged individually.\n\nIt also could be of value to non-developers who simply want to get a better idea of what their full-node is doing - there have been a number of posts by non-developers wanting to see the \"parts moving\" so to speak, and I think this pull request can help with this.\n\nHopefully this is not an ego-commit, and I am not the only one who likes to see this stuff. It's made granular so that it can be configured via bitcoin.conf to hopefully suit most people. Some people like to see historical block download/upload, some only the propagation of blocks, some like to see how the code for tx handling is working, etc. I think it's rare that people want to see all of this at once - which was the only option available with debug=net.\n",

      "body": "@paveljanik Thanks for the feedback. I can certainly merge block2 and block together, if this is what most people want. In an older version I had historical block upload logged, and this generated a lot of output, so block2 was created mostly for this. Currently that logging is disabled entirely which makes block2 less necessary, so perhaps it can be gone already. I'll review the code now, but I think yes block2 debug can be disabled - although I do prefer to give people options, hence leaving it in. If people don't want it, they don't need to enable it.\n\nIn an earlier version I would show timings, i.e. how long the delay between requesting headers/blocks and them being received was - this was useful to refining timeout code and identifying when download was stalled to a far better degree than the current code. i.e. it would determine within 10 seconds with high reliably when a node had stalled rather than the current 2 minutes. (it did this by monitoring the partial download and actively keeping track of typical delay times).\n",

      "body": "@paveljanik Thinking about your suggestion further, I think block does need to have at least two subsets, as the logging of block invs received for old blocks would be too verbose for most people, and yet I suspect some people would want to enable this. (after all, it was enabled with \"net\" before this pull). People might also ask for the debug of block uploads, but since this wasn't in the code before this pull I felt it was reasonable to leave it still out (and  find a better way to log it more concisely for a future pull request).\n",
