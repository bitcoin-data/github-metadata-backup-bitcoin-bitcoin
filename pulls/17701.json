Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\n    should accompany the change.\n  * Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\n    explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\n    was fixed.\n  * Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\n    If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\n    consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\n  * Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\n    bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\n    most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\n    are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\n    developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\n    is often a subjective matter.

Contributors should note which tests cover\n    modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\n    should accompany the change.\n  * Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\n    explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\n    was fixed.\n  * Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\n    If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\n    consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\n  * Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\n    bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\n    most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\n    are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\n    developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\n    is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\n    preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\n    changes are usually rejected.\n  -->\n\n  <!--\n  Bitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\n  needs to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\n  effort to review.

The effect of the latter had not been tested yet though. This is approached in this PR by checking on the expected mempool contents of node1 after the node0 ancestor tests are done, via the following three conditions:\n  - the # of txs in the node1 mempool is equal to the the limit\n  - all txs in node1 mempool are a subset of txs in node0 mempool\n  - the node1 mempool txs match the start of the constructed tx-chain\n\n  Note that this still doesn't *fully* check the expected mempool of node1 (e.g. that it isn't influenced by `prioritisetransaction` RPC on node0), hence I add another TODO.

This never worked for other\narchitectures than x86, and the only 32-bit x86 build left is the Linux\none. Linux users tend to know what architecture they are using.\n\nIt also accidentally ends up in the bitcoin-qt manpage.",

This is confusing and easy to get wrong.

E.g. the mempool constructor queries state that has not been initialized, like randomness (fixed), or command line arguments (not an issue last time I checked).

It also makes the API from *rpc/util.h* look more straightforward as **AddrToPubKey** now uses const references like other functions from there.\n\n  I am not sure why there is a ref-to-ptr conversion in addmultisignatures, so I can only speculate that this is because of \"historical reasons\".\n\n  The ref-to-ptr conversion happens here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L1001\n\n  There, the address of LegacyScriptPubKeyMan& is given to AddrToPubKey.\n\n  Later, in AddrToPubKey, it gets converted back to a reference, because GetKeyForDestination in rpc/util.cpp expects a const ref: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/util.cpp#L140\n\n  Regards,\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  achow101:\n    ACK 1a3a256d5e0443d19757c1f1fceb9c9ede17758a\n  meshcollider:\n    utACK 1a3a256d5e0443d19757c1f1fceb9c9ede17758a\n  promag:\n    Code review ACK 1a3a256d5e0443d19757c1f1fceb9c9ede17758a.\n  hebasto:\n    ACK 1a3a256d5e0443d19757c1f1fceb9c9ede17758a, I have not tested the code, but I have reviewed it and it looks OK, I agree it can be merged.\n\nTree-SHA512: 1a2b8ddab5694ef4c65fac69f011e38dd03a634e84a35857e13bd05ad99fe42af22ee0af6230865e3d2c725693512f3336acb055ede19c958424283e7a3856c4\n",

It also makes the API from *rpc/util.h* look more straightforward as **AddrToPubKey** now uses const references like other functions from there.\n\n  I am not sure why there is a ref-to-ptr conversion in addmultisignatures, so I can only speculate that this is because of \"historical reasons\".\n\n  The ref-to-ptr conversion happens here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L1001\n\n  There, the address of LegacyScriptPubKeyMan& is given to AddrToPubKey.\n\n  Later, in AddrToPubKey, it gets converted back to a reference, because GetKeyForDestination in rpc/util.cpp expects a const ref: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/util.cpp#L140\n\n  Regards,\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  achow101:\n    ACK 1a3a256d5e0443d19757c1f1fceb9c9ede17758a\n  meshcollider:\n    utACK 1a3a256d5e0443d19757c1f1fceb9c9ede17758a\n  promag:\n    Code review ACK 1a3a256d5e0443d19757c1f1fceb9c9ede17758a.\n  hebasto:\n    ACK 1a3a256d5e0443d19757c1f1fceb9c9ede17758a, I have not tested the code, but I have reviewed it and it looks OK, I agree it can be merged.\n\nTree-SHA512: 1a2b8ddab5694ef4c65fac69f011e38dd03a634e84a35857e13bd05ad99fe42af22ee0af6230865e3d2c725693512f3336acb055ede19c958424283e7a3856c4",

It does not have to be a valid transaction.\n\n  This bug was introduced in #15921 (\"validation: Tidy up ValidationState interface\") which was merged in to `master` 28 days ago.\n\n  Luckily this bug was caught before being part of any Bitcoin Core release :)\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  jnewbery:\n    utACK 73b96c94cb6c2afdee7f151768a96944ecaf9d9b\n  laanwj:\n    ACK 73b96c94cb6c2afdee7f151768a96944ecaf9d9b, thanks for discovering and reporting this before it ended up in a release.\n\nTree-SHA512: 7ce6b8f260bcdd9b2ec4ff4b941a891bbef578acf4456df33b7a8d42b248237ec4949e65e2445b24851d1639b10681c701ad500b1c0b776ff050ef8c3812c795",

This was happening because we weren't setting `bnb_used = false` when the preset inputs were used as it should have been. This resulted in a too high fee because the change would go to fees accidentally.\n\n  Apparently this particular case doesn't have a test, so I've added one as well.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  Sjors:\n    ACK eadd130.

This was happening because we weren't setting `bnb_used = false` when the preset inputs were used as it should have been. This resulted in a too high fee because the change would go to fees accidentally.\n\n  Apparently this particular case doesn't have a test, so I've added one as well.\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  Sjors:\n    ACK eadd130.

This is implemented for `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` by moving key-to-destination code from `CWallet` to `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`\n  * In order for `ScriptPubKeyMan` to be generic and work with future `ScriptPubKeyMan`s, `ScriptPubKeyMan::ReturnDestination` is changed to take a `CTxDestination` instead of a `CPubKey`. Since `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` still deals with keys internally, a new map `m_reserved_key_to_index` is added in order to track the keypool indexes that have been reserved.\n  * A bug is fixed in how the total keypool size is calculated as it was omitting `set_pre_split_keypool` which is a bug.\n\n  Split from #17261\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  ryanofsky:\n    Code review ACK 886f1731bec4393dd342403ac34069a3a4f95eea.

This is implemented for `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` by moving key-to-destination code from `CWallet` to `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`\n  * In order for `ScriptPubKeyMan` to be generic and work with future `ScriptPubKeyMan`s, `ScriptPubKeyMan::ReturnDestination` is changed to take a `CTxDestination` instead of a `CPubKey`. Since `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` still deals with keys internally, a new map `m_reserved_key_to_index` is added in order to track the keypool indexes that have been reserved.\n  * A bug is fixed in how the total keypool size is calculated as it was omitting `set_pre_split_keypool` which is a bug.\n\n  Split from #17261\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  ryanofsky:\n    Code review ACK 886f1731bec4393dd342403ac34069a3a4f95eea.

That input triggers a call to `CPubKey::IsFullyValid()` which in turns requires an initialized `secp256k1_context_verify`.\n\n  The fuzzing harness did not fulfil that pre-condition prior to this commit (sorry, my fault!) :)\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```\n  $ mkdir descriptors/\n  $ echo -n 'combo(020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)' > descriptors/input\n  $ UBSAN_OPTIONS=\"print_stacktrace=1:halt_on_error=1\" src/test/fuzz/descriptor_parse -runs=1 descriptors/\n  …\n  pubkey.cpp:210:38: runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 1, which is declared to never be null\n  secp256k1/include/secp256k1.h:305:3: note: nonnull attribute specified here\n      #0 0x561c032ccf25 in CPubKey::IsFullyValid() const src/pubkey.cpp:210:12\n      #1 0x561c022139c3 in (anonymous namespace)::ParsePubkeyInner(Span<char const> const&, bool, FlatSigningProvider&, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >&) src/script/descriptor.cpp:674:24\n      #2 0x561c02207680 in (anonymous namespace)::ParsePubkey(Span<char const> const&, bool, FlatSigningProvider&, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >&) src/script/descriptor.cpp:730:42\n      #3 0x561c0220080e in (anonymous namespace)::ParseScript(Span<char const>&, (anonymous namespace)::ParseScriptContext, FlatSigningProvider&, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >&) src/script/descriptor.cpp:774:23\n      #4 0x561c021ffb07 in Parse(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, FlatSigningProvider&, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >&, bool) src/script/descriptor.cpp:994:16\n      #5 0x561c0218d5d4 in test_one_input(std::vector<unsigned char, std::allocator<unsigned char> > const&) src/test/fuzz/descriptor_parse.cpp:20:9\n  …\n  $\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```\n  $ mkdir descriptors/\n  $ echo -n 'combo(020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)' > descriptors/input\n  $ UBSAN_OPTIONS=\"print_stacktrace=1:halt_on_error=1\" src/test/fuzz/descriptor_parse -runs=1 descriptors/\n  …\n  Done 2 runs in 0 second(s)\n  $\n  ```\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  paymog:\n    ACK 6338c0203416a5f86e9422b6cd479da8af277f2f\n  MarcoFalke:\n    ACK 6338c0203416a5f86e9422b6cd479da8af277f2f 🕊\n\nTree-SHA512: bf24c404e1f64183761b057d2f210c3db85277f4415122977c315d7d6835acb5e897b5d64032615e9e44ad4a16dfe857e94481f6e4b57b6dfa8cb37adb2528a5",
