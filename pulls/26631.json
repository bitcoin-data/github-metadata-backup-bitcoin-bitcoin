    "body": "This PR adds missing test coverage for the `-dustrelayfee` setting, which specifies the fee-rate used to define dust. Output scripts for all common types that are treated as standard by default (P2PK, P2(W)PKH, P2(W)SH, P2TR, bare multisig, null data, unknown witness versions v2+) are created and then checked for dust-mempool-policy each via the `testmempoolaccept` RPC: a tx with an output's nValue equal to the dust threshold should be accepted, one with an nValue of just one 1 satoshi below that should be rejected with reason `dust`. This is repeatedly done for a fixed (but obviously somewhat arbitrary) list of different `-dustrelayfee` settings on a single node, including the default and zero (i.e. no dust limit) settings.\r\n\r\nNote that the first commit introduces a necessary `CScript` helper method `IsWitnessProgram` (using PascalCase in Python is likely controversial; in this case the style for the already existing method `GetSigOpCount` was followed, which also refers to a method in the core `CScript` class).\r\n\r\nSome historical information about dust, contributed by pablomartin4btc:\r\n\"The concept of dust was first introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2577. This [commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9380/commits/eb30d1a5b215c6dd3763d7f7948f2dd8cb61f6bf) from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9380 introduced the -dustrelayfee option. Previous to that PR, the dust feerate was whatever -minrelaytxfee was set to.\"",

This [commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9380/commits/eb30d1a5b215c6dd3763d7f7948f2dd8cb61f6bf) from [PR #9380](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9380) introduced the `-dustrelayfee` option. Previous to that PR, the dust feerate was whatever `-minrelaytxfee` was set to.\r\n\r\nThanks for researching! 👍  I added this paragraph to the PR description, as it is very helpful for reviewers getting deeper into the topic of dust with some historical context.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Taken from the notes of the [review club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/26631). Is it possible to add the label \"Review club\" to this PR please?\r\n\r\n+1",

The ideal scenario would be for those things to happen automatically, but working with what we have... \r\nI would like to make a minor suggestion that I believe makes the logging more readable:\r\n```suggestion\r\n        self.log.info(f\" - Test {type_desc} output (size {len(output_script)}, limit {dust_threshold})\")\r\n```\r\nside by side comparison\r\n![imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-KxmOPSAP8O](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18506343/212340600-75319cc3-7545-41d7-a560-1dc5b7da4ec8.jpg)\r\n\r\nand to remove even more noise:\r\n```suggestion\r\n        self.log.info(f\"- output (size {len(output_script)}, limit {dust_threshold})\")\r\n```\r\n![icon3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18506343/212341569-17abd259-feb2-4285-86ca-b1b13347c61c.png)\r\n\r\nI've noticed that this is a format that you have previously used in `wallet_fast_rescan.py`, but \"- ...\" is currently used in more place, such as `rpc_decodescript.py` and `rpc_psbt.py` and I believe that following the same format across the testing framework is for the better.\r\n",
