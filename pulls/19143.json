Perhaps you were using an old version of libFuzzer when running the `load_external_block_file` fuzzer?",

Also tried with AFL but was very slow since I forgot to compile with persistent mode :/. Will review the latest set of changes now. Coverage for just the `policy_estimator_io` fuzzer is here https://crypt-iq.github.io/policy_cov_llvm_outs/src/policy/fees.cpp.gcov.html",

      "body": "@Crypt-iQ Exactly! We want to have \"coverage stability\": a given input should result in the same coverage for a single run regardless of what has happened in previous runs. Achieving 100% coverage stability is not always possible. It might be due to architectural reasons (globals is a typical example), or it might be due to performance reasons (re-using an object might be required to get decent performance in terms of execs/s). We want to do what we can to at least minimise _unnecessary_ coverage instability.",
