          "body": "This PR was part of #16115 but reviewers requested that this be made into a separate PR. As explained in #16115, it's useful, maybe even crucial, for support, analysis, and debugging purposes for the configuration arguments to be present in the `debug.log` file, as that may be the only artifact provided to the developer or support team. That PR logs the configuration settings (command-line arguments and `bitcoin.conf` contents) when `bitcoind` starts. But sometime later, the debug log file may be \"rotated\" (a new `debug.log` file started so it doesn't grow unbounded in size) and this information would be lost unless the previous `debug.log` is preserved.\r\n\r\nThis PR re-logs the configuration information when the log rotates, ensuring that the current `debug.log` file contains this information. Reviewers had reservations about the previous approach (which you can see in #16115's discussion thread), so this PR implements this functionality in a simpler and (I believe) much better way.",

That can sometimes take quite some iterations or is not even possible at all of the log message is assembled in a highly dynamic way (i.e. lots of %s in the log format string).\r\n\r\nAlso, the function name grep is more effective as it not only shows you in which function the log is printed (single result), but also already at which places this function is declared/defined _and_ called. For my purposes thats quite a lot of useful information about the causes of a log message after a single no-brainer grep considering I didn't even need to open a file yet at this point :)\r\n\r\nThat said, also showing file and line number can for sure also be helpful. Maybe via verbosity levels? ",

The excessive logging may fill your disk and thus make your node crash either cleanly (best case: if disk fill rate is relatively slow) or uncleanly (worst case: if disk fill rate is relatively fast).\r\n\r\nThe hourly logging quota is set *per source location*. Every single source location (say `net_processing.cpp:418`) gets a quota of 1 MB of logging per hour.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* Only logging to disk is rate limited. Logging to console is not rate limited.\r\n* Only `LogPrintf(…)` is rate limited. `LogPrint(category, …)` (`-debug`) is not rate limited.\r\n* `UpdateTip: new best=[…]` is logged using `LogPrintfWithoutRateLimiting(…)` to avoid rate limiting. High log volume is expected for that source location during IBD.\r\n\r\nLive demo:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n$ git diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/init.cpp b/src/init.cpp\r\nindex 023aa9aba..56a250876 100644\r\n--- a/src/init.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/init.cpp\r\n@@ -1232,6 +1232,13 @@ bool AppInitInterfaces(NodeContext& node)\r\n     return true;\r\n }\r\n \r\n+void SimulateDiskFillingAttack() {\r\n+    uint64_t n = 0;\r\n+    while (true) {\r\n+        LogPrintf(\"Chancellor on brink of %d:th bailout for banks.

          "title": "Log: Add debug log category tag",
          "body": "Fixes #21058\r\n\r\nAs the `LogPrint` macro takes the debug log category as parameter, I think it would be nice to have that debug log category also shown together with the according debug log message, to have clear transparency what debug message belongs to what debug category.\r\nIn the past, people inserted the same debug log category name in the message itself, e.g.\r\n`torcontrol.cpp:        LogPrint(BCLog::TOR, \"tor: SAFECOOKIE authentication challenge successful\\n\");`\r\nWith this patch, ~~this would be obsolete, and I would be willing to create a follow-up PR to cleanup that redundancy~~ those then-redundant in-message categories are removed.\r\nHere is a log example how the log looks with this patch and `debug=1`:\r\n```\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [leveldb] WriteBatch memory usage: db=index, before=0.0MiB, after=0.0MiB\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [bench] FlushStateToDisk: write block index to disk completed (12.27ms)\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z FlushStateToDisk: write coins cache to disk (69 coins, 11kB) started\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [coindb] Writing final batch of 0.00 MiB\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [leveldb] WriteBatch memory usage: db=chainstate, before=0.0MiB, after=0.0MiB\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [coindb] Committed 0 changed transaction outputs (out of 69) to coin database...\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z FlushStateToDisk: write coins cache to disk (69 coins, 11kB) completed (0.00s)\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [validation] Enqueuing ChainStateFlushed: block hash=0000000000000025d3499369d144977b6266bac92837748dc452e84cd05bc007\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [validation] ChainStateFlushed: block hash=0000000000000025d3499369d144977b6266bac92837748dc452e84cd05bc007\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [bench] FlushStateToDisk: write block and undo data to disk started\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [bench] FlushStateToDisk: write block and undo data to disk completed (15.44ms)\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [bench] FlushStateToDisk: write block index to disk started\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [leveldb] WriteBatch memory usage: db=index, before=0.0MiB, after=0.0MiB\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [bench] FlushStateToDisk: write block index to disk completed (8.10ms)\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z FlushStateToDisk: write coins cache to disk (0 coins, 0kB) started\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [coindb] Writing final batch of 0.00 MiB\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [leveldb] WriteBatch memory usage: db=chainstate, before=0.0MiB, after=0.0MiB\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [coindb] Committed 0 changed transaction outputs (out of 0) to coin database...\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z FlushStateToDisk: write coins cache to disk (0 coins, 0kB) completed (0.00s)\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [validation] Enqueuing ChainStateFlushed: block hash=0000000000000025d3499369d144977b6266bac92837748dc452e84cd05bc007\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z Shutdown: done\r\n2021-02-07T15:45:55Z [qt] GUI: shutdown : Shutdown finished\r\n```\r\nI tested also with setting `debug=addrman` and it works, only debug log messages of category `addrman` are logged then, with the prefix.\r\nI think this is a step for the better and there is no drawback. I think there should be a better logging with pairing of log category and log level (e.g. like in Tor log), but that should be out of the scope of this PR.\r\nI have read the developer notes, and because of section \"Source code organization\" I extra included the `#include <map>` in `logging.cpp` allthough it was not needed to successfully compile.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am no C++ expert and I guess there are chances that the places/scope of the definitions may be not optimal.\r\nAny help for doing better is appreciated.\r\nI saw the need to clone the function `LogCategoryPrintf` because I had not seen a way to change `__VA_ARGS__` to insert the log category string in the beginning of the first (format string) parameter.\r\nI have allowed edits by maintainers, too, your are welcome to edit.",
