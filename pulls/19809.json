      "body": "@sipa: Agreed that the PR doesn't eliminate the need to grep completely, but I think the main focus is to get rid of the burdensome part of figuring out _what_ to grep in the first place (as expressed in the PR description \"try to figure out a regexp matching the static part of the dynamic log message\"). That can sometimes take quite some iterations or is not even possible at all of the log message is assembled in a highly dynamic way (i.e. lots of %s in the log format string).\r\n\r\nAlso, the function name grep is more effective as it not only shows you in which function the log is printed (single result), but also already at which places this function is declared/defined _and_ called. For my purposes thats quite a lot of useful information about the causes of a log message after a single no-brainer grep considering I didn't even need to open a file yet at this point :)\r\n\r\nThat said, also showing file and line number can for sure also be helpful. Maybe via verbosity levels? ",
