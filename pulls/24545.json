    "body": "This PR brings together all other BIP324 PRs and enables v2 encrypted P2P transport.\r\n\r\nBuilds on top of PRs: #25361, #23233, #23561, #23432. It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

In FOSS there's pretty much never a straightforward spec → implementation flow.\r\n\r\nAgree! My concern was that the undergoing spec changes are possibly so intense that the current publicly available BIP barely has any resemblance with the ~~final~~ updated version anymore and reviewing/testing current PRs would not be a well-invested time. But fortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24545#issuecomment-1141408247, https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/), i.e. no excuses for waiting :)",

Are you able to try again with the latest code?\r\n\r\nThis push:\r\n- Fixed thread locking issue that happened when the Initiator tried to downgrade a v2 BIP324 connection to a v1 plaintext connection whilst the outbound slots were full.\r\n- Fixed another bug where the Initiator would bot send the VERSION message on a v2 connection if there were no more inbound bytes to process. This wasn't caught by the functional test because there were more inbound bytes to process.\r\n\r\nNext up, comments from @dergoegge. Ready for further review.",

Changes in this push are not backwards compatible with the previous code(handshake shapability changes) so it'd be nice if everyone running the branch could run the latest version.",

      "body": "Latest push fixes a bug that was causing non-deterministic integration test failures. Initially, I thought it was intermittent integration test failures but it was a bug in the code for BIP324 implementation. This comment explains for interested readers and documentation.\r\n\r\nv2 supportive inbound clients do not know when the first bytes come in whether the initiator intends on a v1 or a v2 connection. So if they have not received a `VERSION` message and the first message is not a `VERSION` message (assuming the v1 message header is valid, except for the checksum), the bytes must be interpreted as an ellswift pubkey (this is also the case if the previous bytes in the header are invalid, like say the network magic bytes are not correct). However, I was doing this by checking `nVersion == 0` rather than `mapRecvBytesPerMsgType[VERSION] == 0` which caused a race condition because a `VERSION` message could be received, and not yet processed (which happens asynchronously). The way this manifest was that a `P2PConnection` would send `VERSION` to a `TestNode`, `TestNode` would send `VERSION` back, and the `P2PConnection` would send a `VERACK`. When that `VERACK` was received at the `TestNode`, there was a chance that the `VERSION` message was queued, but not processed yet, so `nVersion` was still zero. The code would interpret this as a bad first message and disconnect causing `add_p2p_connection()` to fail with `assert p2p_conn.is_connected` while it was in `wait_until(VERACK)`.\r\n\r\nThe other problem this discovered was that there is no need to change the behavior of v1 clients where the code is v2 aware, but not signalling support.\r\n\r\nYou can see the bug fix with `git diff 601fb3a 4f23845`\r\n\r\nReady for further review.",

At different points of IBD, I added/removed peers to make sure I could get blocks from all v1 peers, v1 + v2 peers, v2-only peers. Once the node was synced, connected to only v2 peers and tested broadcasting transactions. Also compared mempool contents and chaintips with a v23 node running the v1 transport. So far, everything works as expected. ",

      "body": "Thanks for doing this! I compiled it myself with one little [unrelated patch](https://github.com/jsarenik/bitcoin/tree/jsn/bip324-enable) on Alpine Linux (musl-libc) x86_64. It is running at [be.anyone.eu.org](https://be.anyone.eu.org/), all three Bitcoin networks ­— mainnet, testnet and signet (and also [Plebnet Playground](https://plebnet.wiki/wiki/Plebnet_Playground) at [explorer.plebnet.fun](https://explorer.plebnet.fun/), which is a custom signet). IPv4, IPv6, Tor, I2P. Feel free to test with my node running on residential 30 Mbps DSL connection 24/7.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Added IPv6 (via tunnelbroker.net) which did not reliably work before BIP324 and for some time I was assuming that unencrypted Bitcoin traffic on port 8333 is blocked by HE.net, but now it works well. May not be really related to BIP324. On all networks.\r\n\r\nUPDATE2: Peers can come and [verify the session IDs](https://ln.uk.ms/v2_peerinfo-bitcoin.txt) (or for [signet](https://ln.uk.ms/v2_peerinfo-signet.txt)). The addresses without square brackets and what follows after the closing square bracket are MD5 hashed, and only first 16 bytes of the hash are shown there. Example: `solinxtxcc7a2qzs42tjj3zayaxjvisvskptuqcyikwi35kikota.b32.i2p:0` hashes to `992dfda709f41ad9`.",

That is, we listen for v2 connection on a dedicated port in a separate thread (or a separate process but that could also be done later or never) that handles all the initial v2 connection setup (i.e. key exchange). Once a v2 connection has been successfully established the thread registers the new connection with the connection manager. This would lead to the changes here being much more self contained and remove the need for the special casing around v2 connection setup.",

CJDNS (and [Yggdrasil](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23531)) are merely subsets of IPv6 address space for addressing, but they do their own thing encrypting the contents of the packets.\r\n\r\nV2 IMHO makes sense on clearnet IPv4 or IPv6. Even if the other transports go \"cleartext\" on the user-level, still no one can see anything during the transfer and V2 will not make it any better, just use more CPU for nothing (double-encryption, though useful for testing by being able to add an onion address as a V2 peer).",

      "body": "@vostrnad this is expected because the breaking change is in the p2p layer and not the transport. So a v2 connection is successfully established, and likely the inbound peer (not updated) never sees something that it interprets as the VERSION message. It should have timed out/failed eventually though. Did it do that? This isn't currently considered a downgrade scenario because a v2 transport connection was established. If we downgrade to v1 on p2p unresponsiveness, my thinking is that would lead to downgrades in scenarios where a peer is trying to evict, etc. but doesn't close the TCP connection cleanly. Open to suggestions, of course.",
