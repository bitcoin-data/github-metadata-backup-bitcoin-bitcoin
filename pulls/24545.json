    "body": "This PR brings together all other BIP324 PRs and enables v2 encrypted P2P transport.\r\n\r\nBuilds on top of PRs: #25361, #23233, #23561, #23432. It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

It shares very similar goals to CJDNS. It uses an address range of `0200::/8` (as opposed to `fc00::/8` used by CJDNS).\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nDespite Yggdrasil is being considered an alpha quality software, it seems to be much more maintained than CJDNS.\r\n\r\nCJDNS contributions chart:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"911\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-11-17 at 10 02 06\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42201/142169775-992aaae1-f50f-4546-9ddc-ab3dafe5ca27.png\">\r\n\r\nYggdrasil contributions chart:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"911\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-11-17 at 10 02 21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42201/142169846-4730eb7a-4e76-4ddb-924b-4da5977cdeed.png\">\r\n\r\nIt is also much easier to get it Yggdrasil working on variety of systems and architectures (macOS, Windows, Android, ARM64, MIPS) because it is written in pure Go, while it is hard to get CJDNS working on anything else than x86_64 Linux.\r\n\r\n# Yggdrasil resources\r\n\r\n* homepage: https://yggdrasil-network.github.io\r\n* more about Yggdrasil history: https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/2019/01/09/history.html\r\n* FAQ: https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/faq.html\r\n* source code: https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go\r\n* releases: https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/releases\r\n",

          "body": "block-relay-only connections are additional outbound connections that bitcoind makes since v0.19. They participate in block relay, but do not propagate transactions or addresses. They were introduced in #15759.\r\n\r\nWhen creating an outbound block-relay-only connection, since we know that we're never going to announce transactions over that connection, we can save on memory usage by not a `TxRelay` data structure for that connection. When receiving an inbound connection, we don't know whether the connection was opened by the peer as block-relay-only or not, and therefore we always construct a `TxRelay` data structure for inbound connections.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to tell whether an inbound connection will ever request that we start announcing transactions to it. The `fRelay` field in the `version` message may be set to `0` to indicate that the peer does not wish to receive transaction announcements. The peer may later request that we start announcing transactions to it by sending a `filterload` or `filterclear` message, **but only if we have offered `NODE_BLOOM` services to that peer**. `NODE_BLOOM` services are disabled by default, and it has been recommended for some time that users not enable `NODE_BLOOM` services on public connections, for privacy and anti-DoS reasons.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we have not offered `NODE_BLOOM` to the peer _and_ it has set `fRelay` to `0`, then we know that it will never request transaction announcements, and that we can save resources by not initializing the `TxRelay` data structure.",

          "title": "test/BIP324: functional tests for v2 P2P encryption",
          "body": "This PR introduces support for v2 P2P encryption(BIP 324) in the existing functional test framework and adds functional tests for the same.\r\n\r\nIt's built on top of:\r\n* #28331\r\n* #28374\r\n\r\nOnly the last 11 commits belong to this PR. (from `[test/crypto] Add ECDH`  to `[test] Check whether v2 TestNode performs downgrading` )\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n3. this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    - `v2_state` is the object of class `EncryptedP2PState` in `P2PConnection` used to store its keys, session-id etc.\r\n    - a node [advertising](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#advertising-to-support-v2-p2p) support for  v2 P2P is different from a node actually [supporting v2 P2P](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#supporting-v2-p2p) (differ when false advertisement of services occur)\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `supports_v2_p2p` in `P2PConnection` to denote if it supports v2 P2P.\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `advertises_v2_p2p` to denote whether `P2PConnection` which mimics peer behaviour advertises V2 P2P support. Default option is `False`.\r\n    - In the test framework, you can create Inbound and Outbound connections to `TestNode`\r\n        1. During **Inbound Connections**, `P2PConnection` is the initiator [`TestNode` <--------- `P2PConnection`]\r\n            - Case 1:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` advertises/signals v2 P2P support (means `self.nodes[i]` set up with `\"-v2transport=1\"`), different behaviour will be exhibited based on whether:\r\n                    1. `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P\r\n                    2. `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P\r\n               - In a real world scenario, the initiator node would intrinsically know if they support v2 P2P based on whatever code they choose to run. However, in the test scenario where we mimic peer behaviour, we have no way of knowing if `P2PConnection` should support v2 P2P or not. So `supports_v2_p2p` boolean variable is used as an option to enable support for v2 P2P in `P2PConnection`.\r\n              - Since the `TestNode` advertises v2 P2P support (using \"-v2transport=1\"), our initiator `P2PConnection` would send:\r\n                1. (if the `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                2. (if the `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n           - Case 2:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` doesn't signal v2 P2P support; `P2PConnection` being the initiator would send version message to initiate a connection.\r\n       2. During **Outbound Connections** [TestNode --------> P2PConnection]\r\n           - initiator `TestNode` would send:\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n          - Suppose `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P support when it actually doesn't support v2 P2P (false advertisement scenario)\r\n               - `TestNode` sends ellswift + garbage bytes\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives but can't process it and disconnects.\r\n               - `TestNode` then tries using v1 P2P and sends version message\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives/processes this successfully and they communicate on v1 P2P\r\n\r\n4. the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n5. includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.\r\nAlso written a more elaborate explanation here - https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md",

          "body": "This is a more minimal, no-frills version of #24734 for backport. The other fixes and improvements in that pull can be done after.\r\n\r\n*Copy of the PR 24734 description:*\r\n\r\nPRs #22736, #22904 and #23223 changed lock contention logging from a `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` compile-time preprocessor directive to a runtime `lock` log category and improved the logging output. This changed the locking from using `lock()` to `try_lock()`:\r\n\r\n- `void Mutex::UniqueLock::lock()` acquires the mutex and blocks until it gains access to it\r\n\r\n- `bool Mutex::UniqueLock::try_lock()` doesn't block but instead immediately returns whether it acquired the mutex; it may be used by `lock()` internally as part of the deadlock-avoidance algorithm\r\n\r\nIn theory the cost of `try_lock` might be essentially the [same](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-697) relative to `lock`. The test-and-set logic of these calls is purported to be ~ constant time, optimised and light/quick if used carefully (i.e. no mutex convoying), compared to system calls, memory/cache coherency and fences, wait queues, and (particularly) lock contentions. See the discussion around https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-902851054 and after with respect to performance/cost aspects.  However, there are reasonable concerns (see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#discussion_r691277896) and [here](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-620)) that `Base::try_lock()` may be potentially [costly](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-700) or [risky](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22904#issuecomment-930484001) compared to `Base::lock()` in this very frequently called code.\r\n\r\nOne alternative to keep the run-time lock logging would be to gate the `try_lock` call behind the logging conditional, for example as proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ccd73de1dd969097d34634c2be2fc32b03fbd09e and ACKed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-901980815). However, this would add the [cost](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-910102353) of `if (LogAcceptCategory(BCLog::LOCK))` to the hotspot, instead of replacing `lock` with `try_lock`, for the most frequent happy path (non-contention).\r\n\r\nIt turns out we can keep the advantages of the runtime lock contention logging (the ability to turn it on/off at runtime) while out of prudence putting the `try_lock()` call and `lock` logging category behind a  `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` compile-time preprocessor directive, and also still retain the lock logging enhancements of the mentioned PRs, as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24734#issuecomment-1085785480 by W. J. van der Laan, in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#discussion_r691280693, and in the linked IRC discussion.\r\n\r\nProposed here and for backport to v23.\r\n",

We also get the benefit of a slightly more efficient libsecp configure due to https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1088.\r\n\r\nThis also includes a change in our code to migrate from using the [now deprecated](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/commit/99e6568fc6ea2768f5355eb4617283086f756931) `secp256k1_schnorrsig_sign` to `secp256k1_schnorrsig_sign32`.\r\n\r\nGuix Build (on

          "body": "If a node is configured to only use Tor (onlynet=onion), it can be helpful to connect to one or more additional trusted IPv4/IPv6 nodes to ensure connectivity and provide hardening against eclipse attacks. However, if you do this today with addnode, all transactions created and relayed by your onion node will also be relayed to the trusted node over a plaintext connection, which of course is a potential privacy leak.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, there is currently no way to make Bitcoin Core treat a specific node added with addnode as \"blocksonly\". Adding this as an option would seemingly be a simple way to fix this problem.\r\n\r\nWhile it would be possible to resolve this in other ways, say by adding a proxy node configured as blocksonly between the onion node and the trusted node which would relay blocks but no transactions, this both adds complexity and reduces the reliability of the setup by adding another point of failure. You could of course configure your trusted node to use Tor as well and use its onion address for addnode, but this would still cause the setup to fail if there are connectivity issues with Tor itself, say due to government censorship.",

          "body": "This implements the suggestion from #23763 to introduce an option to establish block-relay-connections manually with the `-addnode` RPC.\r\nAdding these can make sense for a node operator that wants to be connected to a anonymity networks like Tor or I2P, but also wants to have additional protection against eclipse attacks: Following the best chain can be more of an issue on anonymity networks because these are smaller and it can be easier to create a lot of sybil nodes there.\r\n\r\nIn that situation, manual block-relay-only connections to peers on clearnet networks can help us staying connected to the best chain, but in contrast to normal manual connections, transactions and addresses aren't transmitted on these links - in particular not our own address or transaction from our wallet. This increases privacy and will also make it harder to perform fingerprinting attacks (connecting our identities over different networks).\r\n\r\nManual Block-Relay connections:\r\n- can be specified with `-addnode` RPC, both with the `add` and `onetry` command\r\n- can be specified with the `-addnode` bitcoind arg (or in bitcoin.conf) with `<IP>=manual-block-relay`\r\n- don't participate in transaction and address relay\r\n- don't get discouraged / punished for misbehavior (but will still get disconnected for sending TX/tx-INV as automatic block-relay-only peers do)\r\n- are not subject to outbound eviction logic (unlike automatic block-relay-only-peers)\r\n",

In FOSS there's pretty much never a straightforward spec → implementation flow.\r\n\r\nAgree! My concern was that the undergoing spec changes are possibly so intense that the current publicly available BIP barely has any resemblance with the ~~final~~ updated version anymore and reviewing/testing current PRs would not be a well-invested time. But fortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24545#issuecomment-1141408247, https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/), i.e. no excuses for waiting :)",

          "title": "wallet: rpc to add automatically generated descriptors",
          "body": "It is useful to have a RPC that can create and add the automatically generated descriptors (that are normally made during creation) to a wallet. This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.",

          "body": "This adds five new tracepoints with documentation and tests for network connections:\r\n\r\n- established connections with `net:inbound_connection` and `net:outbound_connection`\r\n- closed connections (both closed by us or by the peer) with `net:closed_connnection`\r\n- inbound connections that we choose to evict with `net:evicted_inbound_connection`\r\n- connections that are misbehaving and punished with `net:misbehaving_connection`\r\n\r\nI've been using these tracepoints for a few months now to monitor connection lifetimes, re-connection frequency by IP and netgroup, misbehavior, peer discouragement, and eviction and more. Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, score_before=0, score_increase=20, message='getdata message size = 50001', threshold_exceeded=false\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",

          "body": "This PR is an alternative to #25698; as suggested in comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25698#issuecomment-1195369032, the support for 16 byte keys for ChaCha20 can likely be dropped in order to simplify the implementation, i.e. only 32 bytes keys are supported then. To keep the diff minimal and to avoid having to change the callers, the length parameter is still kept right now; one option would be to change the parameter to a fixed-size type, e.g. something like `std::array<std::byte, 32>`.",

An alternative would be to just assert for the minimum size of 16 (and a maximum size of 32), if for some reason supporting keys with a length between 17 and 31 bytes is important; I guess it isn't though, it would also be confusing as the extra bytes wouldn't be used.",

          "title": "p2p: Advertise `NODE_FULL_RBF` and connect to 4 outbound full-rbf peers if `-mempoolfullrbf` is set",
          "body": "`mempoolfullrbf` allows a node to accept replace-by-fee transactions without requiring replaceability signaling. While the replacement transaction is locally accepted, it should be rejected by all your opt-in rbf peers, the default behavior. As such, the odds are low the replacement transaction propagates to miners, unless there are full-rbf transaction-relay paths existent between the node and those miners mempools.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve this issue by enabling the setting of full-rbf transaction-relay link, in both manual and automated fashions. \r\n\r\nThe first commit introduces a `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` service flag to advertise support of full-rbf to our peers if [`mempoolfullrbf`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25353) is set to true. From the results of `getpeerinfo` or `getnetworkinfo`, a node operator can find full-rbf peers on the p2p network to which to manually connect to. The service flag bit select is the 26th one to be compatible with previous full-rbf [experiences](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-June/020570.html).\r\n\r\nThe second commit introduces a `ConnectionType::FULLRBF` if `mempoolfullrbf` is set to true. In `ThreadOpenConnections`, we attempt to keep opened at least 4 outbound full-rbf transaction-relay peer. An outbound full-rbf relay peer is considered as one signaling `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` service flag.\r\n\r\nI think if we have concerns on the network-wise resources consumption from those new outbound full-rbf relay peers, we could deduce them `MAX_ADNNODE_CONNECTIONS`. It should be weighted if we have other concerns about the implications on transaction-relay topology robustness or any spying peers flagging themselves as `NODE_REPLACE_BY_FEE` to attract early full-rbf traffic. What else ?\r\n\r\nI don't hold to the approach re-using the current automatic connection logic in `ThreadOpenConnections`, if there are others ones I'm interested to consider them. I can split the PR in two, if automatic connection requires more thinking.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- add functional tests\r\n- make `MAX_FULLRBF_RELAY_CONNECTIONS` configurable up to `MAX_ADDNODE_CONNECTIONS` ?\r\n- make automatic connection its own boolean setting ?",

The `PeerManager` is made to hold a reference to a `ConnectionsInterface` instead of `CConnman`, which makes it possible for us to mock the connection manager in the newly introduced `PeerManager` unit tests. Two initial unit tests are added for the version handshake and ping/pong logic.",

Its benefit is:\r\n\r\n1. It avoids code repetition at the implementation sites. See [PR#26151](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26151) for a live example. Namely this:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Lots of repetitions (92 lines)</summary>\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nclass Foo\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void PushBack(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.push_back(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Foo::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::vector<int> m_data;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Bar\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void PushBack(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.push_back(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Bar::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::vector<std::string> m_data;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Baz\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    void Insert(x)\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        m_data.insert(x);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    size_t Size()\r\n    {\r\n        LOCK(m_mutex);\r\n        return m_data.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // maybe also other methods if needed...\r\n\r\n    auto Lock()\r\n    {\r\n        return DebugLock<Mutex>{m_mutex, \"Baz::m_mutex\", __FILE__, __LINE__};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    Mutex m_mutex;\r\n    std::set<std::string> m_data;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nbecomes this:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Short (3 lines)</summary>\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nSynced<std::vector<int>> Foo;\r\nSynced<std::vector<std::string>> Bar;\r\nSynced<std::set<std::string>> Baz;\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n2. The mutex is properly encapsulated. With a global mutex and a global variable annotated with `GUARDED_BY()` it is indeed not possible to add new code that accesses the variable without protection (if using Clang and `-Wthread-safety-analysis` and `-Werror`), but it is possible to abuse the mutex and start using it to protect some more, possibly unrelated stuff (we already have this in the current code).\r\n",

This code buffers and reuses those pseudorandom bytes.\r\n\r\nThis improvement is relevant to the new design of BIP324 where:\r\n- One instance of ChaCha20(for encrypting the length) uses only 3 pseudorandom bytes per message, so throwing away 61/64 bytes would be a 95% waste.\r\n- There are efficiencies to be had from being able to send a vector of plaintexts to encrypt rather than creating a concatenated buffer, but that means the block cannot be advanced in between calls.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this also means that our implementation is no longer identical to the reference implementation by Daniel J Bernstein (if I had to guess though, closer to his intention for a stream cipher), and the differential fuzz test against his implementation from #22704 no longer makes sense (if it's not against the pristine version, it does not serve the original purpose)",

          "title": "[Draft / POC] Silent Payments",
          "body": "This PR proposes an early version of [Silent Payment](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8) (author:@RubenSomsen).\r\nIn this scheme, the recipient generates a public address, but the sender tweaks the address and the recipient detects the payment by verifying all transactions on the blockchain. An example use case would be private donations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is not a final version, but to start the discussion and get benchmarks based on a real implementation.\r\n\r\nThis version is built on top of [#994](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/994) (bitcoin-core/secp256k1) for x-only ECDH support and #23480 (bitcoin/bitcoin) for `rawtr()`. Each new silent transaction detected is stored in wallet as a `rawtr()` descriptor. \r\n\r\nIn this implementation, the sender can tweak the recipient address by passing the `silent_payment` option to send RPC. The transaction output will be different from the address entered.\r\n\r\nFor example `./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named send outputs=\"[{\\\"bcrt1pwlh5xuyrpgfunwyww8cfu78yfs2yqyevl7yturavahh5kgxwdd2q5hzgfu\\\": 1.1}]\" fee_rate=1 options=\"{ \\\"silent_payment\\\": true}\"`.\r\n\r\nwill generate `vout` with completely unrelated outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"vout\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 1.10000000,\r\n      \"n\": 0,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(65b19890c5ca40edb816d26f5f48cd9f3ed51121613b1c2405adc1a6dbbc824a)#8myx9tcu\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pvkce3yx9efqwmwqk6fh47jxdnuld2yfpvya3cfq94hq6dkausf9qrfjkgz\",\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 2.02499835,\r\n      \"n\": 1,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(c45cb3d500bbf8f0c8841e8e011b008781d826c16ee348edb822c0f97419bc4d)#26hcce63\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pc3wt84gqh0u0pjyyr68qzxcqs7qasfkpdm353mdcytq0jaqeh3xsuvlykg\",\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny wallet, as long as it has access to private keys, can send silent payments. Thus, this excludes watch-only wallets or wallets with external signers .\r\n\r\nBut the recipient's wallet needs a new flag called `SILENT_PAYMENT`. This flag allows an additional scan that verifies that the wallet keys match the silent payment scheme. When it detects a silent payment that belongs to the wallet, it is stored in a `rawtr()` descriptor.\r\n\r\n`./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named createwallet wallet_name=\"recipient\" silent_payment=true`\r\n\r\nTherefore, scanning each address for each transaction is potentially prohibitive overhead, so the node can be initialized with `keypool=1` or a descriptor with range [0,1] can be imported into a blank wallet. Until there is more benchmark data, it is the safest option. The proposal recommends one static address.\r\n\r\nI've been running some silent payments on signet using wallets with default keypool and default range, I haven't noticed any relevant performance drops on the signet node.\r\nApparently this implementation is working as expected but I can't guarantee that the scheme is implemented correctly or safely, so I'm opening this PR for reviews, modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nThere is a new functional test (`test/functional/wallet_silentpayment.py`) that can help to better understand the implementation.",

          "body": "The block index might contain stale blocks that are not part of the main chain. If a malicious peer is able to probe a node's block index for certain stale blocks then it can use this information to fingerprint the node.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving headers (either through a `cmpctblock` or `headers` messages) a node will send `getheaders` if the predecessor of the first header does not exist. This leaks information from the block index if the predecessor of the header is a stale block because no `getheaders` will be sent in that case revealing that the stale block exists in the index.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents this fingerprinting by sending additional `getheaders` messages in cases where not doing so leaks the existence of stale blocks. To determine when additional messages should be send, we introduce the `PeerManagerImpl::m_chain_tips_sets` map which keeps track of seen chain tips per network, effectively creating a per network view of the node's global block index.  We only try to accept new headers if they connect to anything in our global index and they connect to our active chain or to a chain that was previously sent to us by a peer on the same network. We send a `getheaders` message should these conditions not be met.",

          "body": "This proposes two things:\r\n\r\n1. Make AddrFetch connections to fixed seeds instead of just adding them to AddrMan (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678#issuecomment-1210858925)\r\nWhen adding fixed seeds, we currently add them to AddrMan and then make regular full outbound connections to them. If many new nodes use the fixed seeds for this, it will result in them getting a lot of peers requiring IBD, which will create a lot of traffic for them. With an AddrFetch connection, we will only use them to get addresses from other peers and disconnect afterwards.\r\nThis PR proposes to attempt making AddrFetch connections to 10 peers for better diversity (some may be offline anyway). The fixed seeds will still be added to Addrman as before, but only after a delay of 2 minutes, after which they will hopefully no longer be the only entries in AddrMan.\r\n\r\n2. Move the logic of adding fixed seeds out of `ThreadOpenConnections` into `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` (which is being renamed to `ThreadAddressSeed`).\r\nI think this makes sense in general because adding the fixed seeds is in many ways analogous to querying the DNS seeds, and ThreadOpenConnections, which is there to actually open the connections is already quite complex.\r\nAlso, it makes the changes from 1) easier if we don't have to worry about interfering with the automatic connection making logic.\r\n\r\nOne way to test this is to start without `peers.dat` and run with `-nodnsseed -blocksonly -debug=net` and monitor the debug log and `bitcoin-cli -netinfo` behavior.",

This is a lot by itself, and even more when it's `170`mb * 9 (HOSTS for a guix build).\r\n\r\nWith the changes in this PR, we end up with ~`50`mb of Boost headers in depends, which with some creative patching/pruning, could be trimmed even further. i.e sometimes you end up pulling in an entire boost module, because of a single include in another header we use, but in code that we don't actually need. In other cases there are deprecated headers which are still being used, which could be removed if the modules we care about stopped using them. I will open some PRs upstream to try and improve that situation, ie: https://github.com/boostorg/multi_index/pull/57.",

          "body": "Builds on top of #25907 and one commit from #22341.\r\n\r\nFirst this PR introduces a descriptor wallet RPC `addhdseed`. Similar to its legacy wallet counterpart `sethdseed` it either generates a fresh random seed, for use on a blank wallet, or the user can provide a WIF. Unlike `sethdseed` this RPC call does not add keys / fill the keypool.\r\n\r\nThis allows a user to create a blank wallet (`createwallet`), provide it with a seed (`addhdseed`) and then craft custom descriptors. (An alternative approach would to add a `nodescriptors` argument to `createwallet`, but this RPC seems useful anyway)\r\n\r\nAn example use case of this is setting up a multisig between Core and a hardware wallet. After adding the seed to an otherwise empty wallet, the user would call `getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`. They would then combine this `xpub` and origin info with the one from their hardware wallet (e.g. using `hwi --fingerprint .... getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`  and craft a descriptor like `wsh(sorted_multi(2, [...../87'/0'/0']our_xpub, [..../87'/0'/0']their_xpub))`, and import that. The resulting wallet will be able to sign its part of the transaction.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this PR enables to ability descriptors, such as in the multisig example above, in such a way that any `fingerprint` + `xpub` that is covered by our hd seed(s) can be signed for.",

Followup PRs could use the ALLOW_LIST flags for better documentation and error checking in the future. For example, #17493 builds on this to disallow conflicting config values. \r\n\r\nThis change was originally made as part of #17493",

Change includes release notes.\r\n\r\nPart of the motivation for this change is to improve usability and prevent settings that look valid from being silently ignored. Another motivation is to be able to remove confusing \"reverse precedence\" logic in #17581",

Changes:\r\n\r\n#### Handshake shapability\r\n\r\n- Bidirectional garbage and terminators\r\n- Early key response by responder upon first mismatching byte\r\n- Allowing for multiple rounds in key exchange\r\n- Remove bias away from NETWORK_MAGIC || \"version\\x00\" for ElligatorSwift encodings\r\n- Remove garbage terminator from the garbage authentication packet as it is implicitly authenticated\r\n\r\n#### Bugfixes\r\n\r\n- An already established v1 connection peer should not send out an ellswift key if a message has a bad v1 header\r\n- The previous changes to test_framewotk.py made all tests fail with a small probability, that's now fixed\r\n\r\n#### Test vectors\r\n- One-sided test vectors consistent with the BIP (the BIP actually needs updating which is WIP)\r\n- Test vectors in a json file instead of making net_tests.cpp even longer\r\n\r\n#### RPC\r\n\r\n- Expose transport protocol type via `getpeerinfo`\r\n- Expose v2 session id via `getpeerinfo`\r\n\r\nAlso rebased the PR.\r\n\r\nReady for further review. Changes in this push are not backwards compatible with the previous code(handshake shapability changes) so it'd be nice if everyone running the branch could run the latest version.",

It seemed a little weird for me \"The node (see getpeerinfo for nodes)\", it could mean a lot of things e.g. the node id.\r\n- Some small improv/clean-up: use `const` where possible, rename some vars, and remove the check for nullance for `command` since it's a non-optional field.",

The goal is to be able to cache more coins with the same memory usage, and allocate/deallocate faster.\r\n\r\nThis is a reimplementation of #22702. The goal was to implement it in a way that is simpler to review & test\r\n\r\n* There is now a generic `PoolResource` for allocating/deallocating memory. This has practically the same API as `std::pmr::memory_resource`. (Unfortunately I cannot use std::pmr because libc++ simply doesn't implement that API).\r\n* Thanks to sipa there is now a fuzzer for PoolResource! On a fast machine I ran it for ~770 million executions without finding any issue.\r\n\r\n* The estimation of the correct node size is now gone, PoolResource now has multiple pools and just needs to be created large enough to have space for the unordered_map nodes.\r\n\r\nI ran benchmarks with #22702, mergebase, and this PR. Frequency locked Intel i7-8700, clang++ 13.0.1 to reindex up to block 690000.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbitcoind -dbcache=5000 -assumevalid=00000000000000000002a23d6df20eecec15b21d32c75833cce28f113de888b7 -reindex-chainstate -printtoconsole=0 -stopatheight=690000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe performance is practically identical with #22702, just 0.4% slower.

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #10102 + #19460.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`5f91aa3d8b47` multiprocess: Add bitcoin-gui -ipcconnect option](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461/commits/5f91aa3d8b47cee97e625c3b5689a37dbd941eff)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBuilding on #10102, this adds an `-ipcconnect` option to `bitcoin-gui` that connects the GUI to an existing `bitcoin-node` process already running in the background instead of spawning a new `bitcoin-node` process. This allows the GUI to be started and stopped independently of the node. By default with this change, `bitcoin-gui` will check if a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` socket exists and try to connect to that. If that doesn't work, it will spawn a new node process and start up the same way it did before this PR.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-gui` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which tries to connect if possible as described above, and spawns a new `bitcoin-node` process if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to never connect to an existing node and always spawn a new one, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, basic functionality works and gui instances can connect and disconnect from a running node. But there are rough edges: If a gui process doesn't shut down cleanly, the node can see unhandled IpcExceptions, and if node command line options are passed to `bitcoin-gui` and `bitcoin-gui` connects to an exiting bitcoin-node process instead of spawning a new one, the node options will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)",

So if they have not received a `VERSION` message and the first message is not a `VERSION` message (assuming the v1 message header is valid, except for the checksum), the bytes must be interpreted as an ellswift pubkey (this is also the case if the previous bytes in the header are invalid, like say the network magic bytes are not correct). However, I was doing this by checking `nVersion == 0` rather than `mapRecvBytesPerMsgType[VERSION] == 0` which caused a race condition because a `VERSION` message could be received, and not yet processed (which happens asynchronously). The way this manifest was that a `P2PConnection` would send `VERSION` to a `TestNode`, `TestNode` would send `VERSION` back, and the `P2PConnection` would send a `VERACK`. When that `VERACK` was received at the `TestNode`, there was a chance that the `VERSION` message was queued, but not processed yet, so `nVersion` was still zero. The code would interpret this as a bad first message and disconnect causing `add_p2p_connection()` to fail with `assert p2p_conn.is_connected` while it was in `wait_until(VERACK)`.\r\n\r\nThe other problem this discovered was that there is no need to change the behavior of v1 clients where the code is v2 aware, but not signalling support.\r\n\r\nYou can see the bug fix with `git diff 601fb3a 4f23845`\r\n\r\nReady for further review.",

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an `--enable-multiprocess` configure option which builds new `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables with relevant functionality isolated into different processes. See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n",

          "body": "At the moment, the eviction logic is mangled across two different components (`CConnman`, `PeerManager`), so we can't really test it in isolation. This is not completely true for the inbound eviction logic as it exists as static functions in `net.{h.cpp}` for which tests already exist. However, the outbound eviction logic is not covered by any fuzz tests and is only testable by spinning up both a connman and peerman.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits out the eviction logic into its own component `EvictionManager`. In addition to isolating the eviction logic, we get rid of several layer violations (e.g. `CConnman::ForEachNode/ForNode` calls, `CNode::m_last_block_time`, etc.) between `net` and `net processing`.\r\n\r\nOne instance of the `EvictionManager` is created at start up and passed as a reference to the connection and peer managers. The connection and peer managers report all eviction relevant information to the eviction manager who ultimately suggests nodes to evict as the result of `EvictionManager::SelectInboundNodeToEvict` and `EvictionManager::SelectOutboundNodesToEvict`.",

At different points of IBD, I added/removed peers to make sure I could get blocks from all v1 peers, v1 + v2 peers, v2-only peers. Once the node was synced, connected to only v2 peers and tested broadcasting transactions. Also compared mempool contents and chaintips with a v23 node running the v1 transport. So far, everything works as expected. ",

      "body": "Thanks for doing this! I compiled it myself with one little [unrelated patch](https://github.com/jsarenik/bitcoin/tree/jsn/bip324-enable) on Alpine Linux (musl-libc) x86_64. It is running at [be.anyone.eu.org](https://be.anyone.eu.org/), all three Bitcoin networks ­— mainnet, testnet and signet (and also [Plebnet Playground](https://plebnet.wiki/wiki/Plebnet_Playground) at [explorer.plebnet.fun](https://explorer.plebnet.fun/), which is a custom signet). IPv4, IPv6, Tor, I2P. Feel free to test with my node running on residential 30 Mbps DSL connection 24/7.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Added IPv6 (via tunnelbroker.net) which did not reliably work before BIP324 and for some time I was assuming that unencrypted Bitcoin traffic on port 8333 is blocked by HE.net, but now it works well. May not be really related to BIP324. On all networks.\r\n\r\nUPDATE2: Peers can come and [verify the session IDs](https://ln.uk.ms/v2_peerinfo-bitcoin.txt) (or for [signet](https://ln.uk.ms/v2_peerinfo-signet.txt)). The addresses without square brackets and what follows after the closing square bracket are MD5 hashed, and only first 16 bytes of the hash are shown there. Example: `solinxtxcc7a2qzs42tjj3zayaxjvisvskptuqcyikwi35kikota.b32.i2p:0` hashes to `992dfda709f41ad9`.",

This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/utxo-dumpload-compressed\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Original change description\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with assumeutxo, here's a brief summary from [the issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15605) (where any conceptual discussion not specific to this implementation should happen):\r\n\r\n> assumeutxo would be a way to initialize a node using a headers chain and a serialized version of the UTXO state which was generated from another node at some block height. A client making use of this UTXO \"snapshot\" would specify a hash and expect the content of the resulting UTXO set to yield this hash after deserialization. \r\n> \r\n> This would allow users to bootstrap a usable pruned node & wallet far more quickly (and with less disk usage) than waiting for a full initial block download to complete, since we only have to sync blocks between the base of the snapshot and the current network tip. Needless to say this is at expense of accepting a different trust model, though how different this really ends up being from `assumevalid` in effect is worth debate.\r\n\r\nIn short, this is an interesting change because it would allow nodes to get up and running within minutes given a ~3GB file (at time of writing) under an almost identical trust model to assumevalid.\r\n\r\nIn this implementation, I add a few RPC commands: `dumptxoutset` creates a UTXO snapshot and writes it to disk, and `loadtxoutset` intakes a snapshot from disk, constructs and activates chainstate based on it, and continues a from-scratch initial block download in the background for the sole purpose of validating the snapshot. Once the snapshot is validated, we throw away the chainstate used for background validation.\r\n\r\nThe assumeutxo procedure as implemented is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A UTXO snapshot is loaded with the `loadtxoutset <path>` RPC command.\r\n1. A new chainstate (`CChainState`) is initialized using `ChainstateManager::ActivateSnapshot()`:\r\n   1. The serialized UTXO data is read in and various sanity checks are performed, e.g. compare expected coin count, recompute the hash and compare it with assumeutxo hash in source code.\r\n   1. We \"fast forward\" `new_chainstate->m_chain` to have a tip at the base of the snapshot (with or without block data). Lacking block data, we fake the `nTx` counts of the constituent `CBlockIndex` entries.\r\n   1. `LoadChainTip()` is called on the new snapshot and it is installed as our active chainstate.\r\n1. The new assumed-valid chainstate is now our active, and so that enters IBD until it is synced to the network's tip. Presumably the snapshot would be taken relatively close to the current tip but far enough away to avoid meaningful reorgs, say 10,000 blocks deep.\r\n1. Once the active chainstate is out of IBD, our old validation chain continues IBD \"in the background\" while the active chainstate services requests from most of the system.\r\n1. Once the background validation chainstate reaches a height equal the base of the snapshot, we take the hash of its UTXO set and ensure it equals the expected hash based on the snapshot. If the hashes are equivalent, we delete the validation chainstate and move on without event; if they aren't, we log loudly and fall back to the validation chainstate (we should probably just shut down).\r\n\r\nThe implicit assumption is that the background validation chain will always be a subset of the assumed-valid snapshot chain while the latter is active. We don't properly handle reorgs that go deeper than the base of the snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Changes (already merged/outdated)\r\n\r\n![chainstate-beforeafter (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/54435797-a16b0780-4707-11e9-89c3-c90b5686804d.png)\r\n \r\nThe crux of this change is in removing any assumptions in the codebase that there is a single chainstate, i.e. any references to global variables `chainActive`, `pcoinsTip`, et al. need to be replaced with functions that return the relevant chainstate data at that moment in time. This change also takes `CChainState` to its logical conclusion by making it more self-contained - any references to globals like `chainActive` are removed with class-local references (`m_chain`).\r\n\r\nA few minor notes on the implementation:\r\n\r\n- When we attempt to load a wallet with a BestBlock locator lower than the base of a snapshot and the snapshot has not yet been validated, we refuse to load the wallet.\r\n\r\n- For additional notes, see [the new assumeutxo docs](https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin/blob/utxo-dumpload-compressed/doc/assumeutxo.md).",

          "body": "I started forking off parts of this big PR so that we can review and merge in chunks with better efficiency.\r\n1. [p2p: Erlay support signaling](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23443) — done\r\n2. [Follow-up](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26359) — done\r\n3. [p2p: Fill reconciliation sets and request reconciliation (Erlay)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26283) — pending\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nPlease use this discussion for high-level topics and keep the nitpics for the sub-PRs. The state of this branch might be not the cleanest and the freshest, although last time I rebased in on 2022/05/12 to be in sync {with master, with the latest child PR} and pass CI (modulo one race condition issue).\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of  [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) , using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec  [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki) ). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670) .\r\n\r\nThis PR supersedes the previous [one](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261), because that one got too much review comments (I tried to resolve all of them for this version), and also it was much refactored since then.\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I’ll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n* save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n* increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n* improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\n### How to review\r\n\r\nI suggest doing `make clean && autogen.sh && configure` before you try building it locally.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nI created 2 discussion boards, please discuss not-code-related topics there:\r\n1. [Understanding bandwidth savings](https://github.com/naumenkogs/txrelaysim/issues/7)\r\n2. [Joining mainnet testing](https://github.com/naumenkogs/txrelaysim/issues/8)",

Both have their uses (in particular, the MuHash3072 code can benefit from multiple-of-64-bytes assumptions), plus the separation results in more readable code. Also, since FastRandomContext effectively had its own (more naive) caching on top of ChaCha20, that can be dropped in favor of ChaCha20's new built-in caching.\r\n\r\nI thought about rebasing #25712 on top of this, but the changes before are fairly extensive, so redid it instead.",

The RFC8439 instance is re-keyed every 256 messages for forward secrecy.\r\n* Outer layer uses a forward secure version of ChaCha20, `FSChaCha20` which re-keys itself every 256 messages for forward secrecy. It is used to encrypt the message length resulting in a pseudorandom byte stream.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).",

I am surprised by all the special casing around handling v2 connections which I think mostly stems from the fact that currently v1 and v2 connections are being accepted on the same port. Is that really required/desirable for some reason?\r\n\r\nI kind of expected to see a similar approach to how we handle connections from different networks (e.g. Tor, CJDNS, I2P). That is, we listen for v2 connection on a dedicated port in a separate thread (or a separate process but that could also be done later or never) that handles all the initial v2 connection setup (i.e. key exchange). Once a v2 connection has been successfully established the thread registers the new connection with the connection manager. This would lead to the changes here being much more self contained and remove the need for the special casing around v2 connection setup.",

      "body": "> My review feedback will be limited to the networking changes as I can't really judge the soundness of the underlying crypto used (Cryptography 1 by Dan Boneh didn't quite get me there yet :D).\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated. I did not even finish that first course yet :)\r\n\r\n> The current approach here feels a little \"slapped on\" to me. I am surprised by all the special casing around handling v2 connections which I think mostly stems from the fact that currently v1 and v2 connections are being accepted on the same port. Is that really required/desirable for some reason?\r\n\r\nPractically speaking for myself, it actually only makes sense when v1 and v2 live on the same port. Example: a tunelled IPv6 connection may be doing some L7 blocking, but when the filter sees other full-duplex communication which it can not decipher, it may be less willing to block the whole port since there is other noise on it.\r\n\r\n> I kind of expected to see a similar approach to how we handle connections from different networks (e.g. Tor, CJDNS, I2P). ...\r\n\r\nTor, CJDNS and I2P are both layers and addressing schemes at the same time. CJDNS (and [Yggdrasil](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23531)) are merely subsets of IPv6 address space for addressing, but they do their own thing encrypting the contents of the packets.\r\n\r\nV2 IMHO makes sense on clearnet IPv4 or IPv6. Even if the other transports go \"cleartext\" on the user-level, still no one can see anything during the transfer and V2 will not make it any better, just use more CPU for nothing (double-encryption, though useful for testing by being able to add an onion address as a V2 peer).",

          "title": "tests: Improve runtime of some tests when `--enable-debug`",
          "body": "When configured with `--enable-debug`, many tests become dramatically slower. These slow downs are particularly noticed in tests that generate a lot of blocks in separate calls, make a lot of RPC calls, or send a lot of data from the test framework's P2P connection. This PR aims to improve the runtime of some of the slower tests and improve the overall runtime of the test runner. This has improved the runtime of the test runner from ~400s to ~140s on my computer.\r\n\r\nThe slowest test by far was `wallet_import_rescan.py`. This was taking ~320s. Most of that time was spent waiting for blocks to be mined and then synced to the other nodes. It was generating a new block for every new transaction it was creating in a setup loop. However it is not necessary to have one tx per block. By mining a block only every 10 txs, the runtime is improved to ~61s.\r\n\r\nThe second slowest test was `feature_fee_estimation.py`. This test spends most of its time waiting for RPCs to respond. I was able to improve its runtime by batching RPC requests. This has improved the runtime from ~201s to ~140s.\r\n\r\nIn `feature_taproot.py`, the test was constructing a Python `CScript` using a very large list of `OP_CHECKSIG`s. The constructor for the Python implementation of `CScript` was iterating this list in order to create a `bytes` from it even though a `bytes` could be created from it without iterating. By making the `bytes` before passing it into the constructor, we are able to improve this test's runtime from ~131s to ~106s.\r\n\r\nAlthough `interface_rpc.py` was not typically a slow test, I found that it would occasionally have a super long runtime. It typically takes ~7s, but I have observed it taking >400s to run on occasion. This longer runtime occurs more often when `--enable-debug`. This long runtime was caused by the \"exceeding work queue\" test which is really just trying to trigger a race condition. In this test, it would create a few threads and try an RPC in a loop in the hopes that eventually one of the RPCs would be added to the work queue while another was processing. It used `getrpcinfo` for this, but this function is fairly fast. I believe what was happening was that with `--enable-debug`, all of the code for receiving the RPC would often take longer to run than the RPC itself, so the majority of the requests would succeed, until we got lucky after 10's of thousands of requests. By changing this to use a slow RPC, the race condition can be triggered more reliably, and much sooner as well. I've used `waitfornewblock` with a 500ms timeout. This improves the runtime to ~3s consistently.\r\n\r\nThe last test I've changed was `rpc_packages.py`. This test was one of the higher runtime variability tests. The main source of this variation appears to be waiting for the test node to relay a transaction to the test framework's P2P connection. By whitelisting that peer, the variability is reduced to nearly 0.\r\n\r\nLastly, I've reordered the tests in `test_runner.py` to account for the slower runtimes when configured with `--enable-debug`. Some of the slow tests I've looked at were listed as being fast which was causing overall `test_runner.py` runtime to be extended. This change makes the test runner's runtime be bounded by the slowest test (currently `feature_fee_estimation.py` with my usual config (`-j 60`).",

          "title": "tracing: Only prepare tracepoint arguments when actually tracing",
          "body": "Currently, if the tracepoints are compiled (e.g. in depends and release builds), we always prepare the tracepoint arguments regardless of the tracepoints being used or not. We made sure that the argument preparation is as cheap as possible, but we can almost completely eliminate any overhead for users not interested in the tracepoints (the vast majority), by gating the tracepoint argument preparation with an `if(something is attached to this tracepoint)`. To achieve this, we use the optional semaphore feature provided by SystemTap.\r\n\r\nThe first commit simplifies and deduplicates our tracepoint macros from 12 TRACEn macros to a single TRACEPOINT macro. The `TRACE(context, event)` macro (without arguments) is renamed to `TRACEPOINT0(context, event)`. This makes them easier to use and also avoids more duplicate macro definitions in the second commit. These changes should be compatible with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541 and both https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26531 should be trivial to rebase and adopt to this.\r\n\r\nThe Linux tracing tools I'm aware of (bcc, bpftrace, libbpf, and systemtap) all support the semaphore gating feature. Thus, all existing tracepoints and their argument preparation is gated in the second commit. For details, please refer to the commit messages and the updated documentation in `doc/tracing.md`.\r\n\r\nAlso adding unit tests that include all tracepoint macros to make sure there are no compiler problems with them (e.g. some varadiac extension not supported). \r\n\r\nReviewers might want to check:\r\n- Do the tracepoints still work for you? Do the examples in `contrib/tracing/` run on your system (as bpftrace frequently breaks on every new version, please test master too if it should't work for you)? Do the CI interface tests still pass?\r\n- Is the new documentation clear? \r\n- As a demonstration that the tracepoint gating works, https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/commit/21774ab9618932a4df68baa36de11c7788adf143 extends the PR branch. Here is the [Cirrus CI output](https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5278617885212672) for the task running the USDT interface tests on this commit. Do you agree that this demonstrates that the semaphore gating works?\r\n- The `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE(event, context)` macros places global variables in our global namespace. Is this something we strictly want to avoid or maybe move to all `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE`s to a separate .cpp file or even namespace? I like having the `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE()` in same file as the `TRACEPOINT()`, but open for suggestion on alternative approaches. \r\n- Are newly added tracepoints in the unit tests visible when using `readelf -n /src/test/test_bitcoin`? You can run the new unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin --run_test=util_trace_tests* --log_level=all`.\r\n\r\nThese links might provide more contextual information for reviewers:\r\n- [How SystemTap Userspace Probes Work by eklitzke](https://eklitzke.org/how-sytemtap-userspace-probes-work) (actually an example on Bitcoin Core; mentions that with semaphores \"the overhead for an untraced process is effectively zero.\")\r\n- [libbpf comment on USDT semaphore handling](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/blob/1596a09b5de2a50ab8d44218fc29b6d42f886305/src/usdt.c#L83-L92) (can recommend the whole comment for background on how the tracepoints and tracing tools work together)\r\n- https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/UserSpaceProbeImplementation#Semaphore_Handling",

          "body": "The copyright years have many issues:\r\n\r\n* They may be wrong. For example, this can happen when code is moved from one file to a different one without taking over the copyright years. Or it may happen when the wrong years are inserted by a script or developer.\r\n* They are redundant. `git` already tracks the author date for every line of code in every commit.\r\n* They are not needed to establish \"copyright\", see https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/copyright-notices-in-open-source-software-projects/, or https://reuse.software/faq/#years-copyright. Also, anyone who needs them for legal reasons would need to discover the ground truth themselves anyway. For example, with `git blame`, or `git log ...`, or by other means.\r\n* They cause pointless churn. See for example commit 306ccd4927a2efe325c8d84be1bdb79edeb29b04, or drive-by contributions bumping them.\r\n* Many modern open source software projects never added them in the first place, or already removed them, see section below.\r\n\r\nIn theory they can be removed completely. While this should be legally fine, some contributors raised legal uncertainty. So instead, bump each year range one final time  to `-present` and leave the initial year untouched.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a URL redirect is resolved in the second commit.\r\n\r\nFinally, the `_COPYRIGHT_YEAR` build constant is kept untouched, and still expected to be bumped every year, see for example commit 06dd571534c8ecdf7ade77546fcf3a56b3651f68. In theory it could be bumped to `-present` as well, but this change would cause user-visible changes, so discussion should be done in a separate thread.\r\n\r\nExamples of removed years in other projects:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc (Done before accepting external contributions?)\r\n* https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2bc1d775f510196154283374284f98d3eae03544 (Not legally reviewed?)\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nExamples of no years in other projects:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blame/2d66dc44f5abef975bed86af12cb5facb6729a1a/src/renderer/base/FontInfoBase.cpp#L1\r\n* https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/33f35b04ef0f32f25624a6be59f8635675e3e131/packages/compiler/src/chars.ts#L3\r\n* https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blame/27b8f54f5174aa4d8ea254a7efefd7110b247c17/clang/lib/Basic/Targets/X86.cpp#L4-L5\r\n* ...",

It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

          "body": "AddrMan currently doesn't track the number of its entries by network, it only knows the total number of addresses. This PR makes AddrMan keep track of these numbers, which would be helpful for multiple things:\r\n\r\n1. Allow to specifically add fixed seeds to AddrMan of networks where we don't have any addresses yet - even if AddrMan as a whole is not empty (partly fixing #26035). This is in particular helpful if the user abruptly changes `-onlynet` settings (such that addrs that used to be reachable are no longer and vice versa), in which case they currently could get stuck and not find any outbound peers. The second commit of this PR implements this.\r\n1. (Future work): Add logic for automatic connection management with respect to networks - such as making attempts to have at least one connection to each reachable network as suggested [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26035#issuecomment-1249420209). This would involve requesting an address from a particular network from AddrMan, and expanding its corresponding function `AddrMan::Select()`  to do this requires internal knowledge of the current number of addresses for each network and table to avoid getting stuck in endless loops.\r\n1. (Future work): Perhaps display the totals to users. At least I would find this helpful to debug, the existing option (`./bitcoin-cli -addrinfo`) is rather indirect by doing the aggregation itself in each call, doesn't distinguish between new and tried, and being based on `AddrMan::GetAddr()` it's also subject to a quality filter which we probably don't want in this spot.",

          "body": "**N.B.:** This is my second attempt at introducing this optimization. #12519 (2018) was closed in deference to switching to doing gathering socket writes using `sendmsg(2)`, which I agree would have superior performance due to fewer syscalls, but that work was apparently abandoned in late 2018. Ever since, Bitcoin Core has continued writing tons of runt packets to the wire. Can we proceed with my halfway solution for now?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSince Nagle's algorithm is disabled, each and every call to `send(2)` can potentially generate a separate TCP segment on the wire. This is especially inefficient when sending the tiny header preceding each message payload.\r\n\r\nLinux implements a `MSG_MORE` flag that tells the kernel not to push the passed data immediately to the connected peer but rather to collect it in the socket's internal transmit buffer where it can be combined with data from successive calls to `send(2)`. Where available, specify this flag when calling `send(2)` in `CConnman::SocketSendData(CNode &)` if the data buffer being sent is not the last one in `node.vSendMsg`.",

      "body": "@vostrnad this is expected because the breaking change is in the p2p layer and not the transport. So a v2 connection is successfully established, and likely the inbound peer (not updated) never sees something that it interprets as the VERSION message. It should have timed out/failed eventually though. Did it do that? This isn't currently considered a downgrade scenario because a v2 transport connection was established. If we downgrade to v1 on p2p unresponsiveness, my thinking is that would lead to downgrades in scenarios where a peer is trying to evict, etc. but doesn't close the TCP connection cleanly. Open to suggestions, of course.",

          "body": "This pull request is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18 and more specifically its \"Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel\". This commit was originally authored by empact and is taken from its parent PR #25152.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nThere is an ongoing effort to decouple the `ArgsManager` used for command line parsing user-provided arguments from the libbitcoinkernel library (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25527, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25862, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26177, and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125). The `ArgsManager` is defined in `system.h`. A similar pull request extracting functionality from `system.h` has been merged in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27238.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\nNext to providing better code organization, this PR removes some reliance of the tree of libbitcoinkernel header includes on `system.h` (and thus the `ArgsManager` definition) by moving filesystem related functions out of the `system.*` files. \r\n\r\nThere is already a pair of `fs.h` / `fs.cpp` in the top-level `src/` directory. They were not combined with the files introduced here, to keep the patch cleaner and more importantly because they are often included without the utility functions. The new files are therefore named `fs_helpers` and the existing `fs` files are moved into the util directory.\r\n\r\nFurther commits splitting more functionality out of `system.h` are still in #25152 and will be submitted in separate PRs once this PR has been processed.",
