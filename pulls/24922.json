    "body": "This PR separates the storage abstraction layer (e.g., leveldb layer) from the bitcoin core application layer. This has many benefits:\r\n\r\n- Easier testing for the bitcoin core application layer without requiring an open database\r\n- Easier replacement for the storage library in case it's decided to do it in the future with a simple implementation of an interface\r\n- Ensure that any other future implementations can live to the same standard we have now by testing different implementations the same way\r\n- Better interface description to understand the expectations from the implementations of the interface\r\n- Much easier bench-marking separate from serialization\r\n\r\nThis change has caused zero modification to the bitcoin core application source code, as I deliberately maintained everything from the outside. This change is a drop-in replacement to everything that uses leveldb.\r\n\r\nThings I failed to do without breaking backwards compatibility, so I skipped:\r\n- Use DBIndex to decide the prefix of the storage. The problem here is that some key/value database systems provide other mechanisms for separating between different database \"tables\", so to say. In our case, we use a `char` as a prefix. For example, lmdb provides an integer index. The problem here is that when keys are submitted as a Span, prepending a prefix is a relatively expensive operation as it requires copying the whole key. I don't see how we can do this without that. This is a conflict between the serialization and the storage layer that I couldn't resolve.\r\n\r\nThings I'd love to achieve in the next PR(s):\r\n- ~Create an in-memory database that can easily replace leveldb and assist in tests~ (Given that tests use in-memory db as was pointed out in the comments, we may or may not do this)\r\n- Move the block and block-undo storage behind this interface and use DBIndex as a way to tell the implementation how to store the data (in files or in leveldb)\r\n",

I'm not even fully onboard on the idea that LevelDB is part of the \"consensus layer\", but I understand that LevelDB is part of the consensus library; after all it's a key/value store and it should be just that. The solution to this fear, however, is not keeping it untouched (because it was touched before, quite often over the last decade). But the solution is to quantify how it works and make it part of the protocol and run proper tests, like it has always been done in this repo. \r\n\r\nAnd I'm happy to do more to make this PR more appealing and address any concerns, whether it's tests or something else.

It's not hard to see how interface-behavior can be well-defined and tested.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n",
