    "body": "This PR separates the storage abstraction layer (e.g., leveldb layer) from the bitcoin core application layer. This has many benefits:\r\n\r\n- Easier testing for the bitcoin core application layer without requiring an open database\r\n- Easier replacement for the storage library in case it's decided to do it in the future with a simple implementation of an interface\r\n- Ensure that any other future implementations can live to the same standard we have now by testing different implementations the same way\r\n- Better interface description to understand the expectations from the implementations of the interface\r\n- Much easier bench-marking separate from serialization\r\n\r\nThis change has caused zero modification to the bitcoin core application source code, as I deliberately maintained everything from the outside. This change is a drop-in replacement to everything that uses leveldb.\r\n\r\nThings I failed to do without breaking backwards compatibility, so I skipped:\r\n- Use DBIndex to decide the prefix of the storage. The problem here is that some key/value database systems provide other mechanisms for separating between different database \"tables\", so to say. In our case, we use a `char` as a prefix. For example, lmdb provides an integer index. The problem here is that when keys are submitted as a Span, prepending a prefix is a relatively expensive operation as it requires copying the whole key. I don't see how we can do this without that. This is a conflict between the serialization and the storage layer that I couldn't resolve.\r\n\r\nThings I'd love to achieve in the next PR(s):\r\n- ~Create an in-memory database that can easily replace leveldb and assist in tests~ (Given that tests use in-memory db as was pointed out in the comments, we may or may not do this)\r\n- Move the block and block-undo storage behind this interface and use DBIndex as a way to tell the implementation how to store the data (in files or in leveldb)\r\n",

We achieve this mainly by:\r\n\r\n- Using private non-virtual interfaces (private `doFoo`'s) to:\r\n  - Move `LevelDB`-specific code out of the header,\r\n  - While keeping templatized serialization logic in the header\r\n- Using the pimpl idiom to move `LevelDB`-specific member variables out of the header\r\n\r\nCoincidentally, this PR also makes obfuscation an implementation detail of the database, as described in this code comment:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2f0f056e08cd5a1435120592a9ecd212fcdb915b/src/dbwrapper.h#L39-L42\r\n",

          "body": "By splitting `ArgsManager` and related functions out of the grab-bag `util/system` file, this enables more specific includes, ~referencing `ArgsManager` without pulling in `gArgs`~, and eliminate a circular dependency between `chainparamsbase` and `utils/system`.\r\n\r\nThe proposed new modules are:\r\n* util/args_manager - ArgsManager and related functions\r\n* util/args - gArgs only - separate to support the goal of limiting the scope of `gArgs`\r\n* util/system - a variety of file system and sytem-related functions\r\n\r\nOther notable points:\r\n* I find it a bit concerning that `ArgsManager::ReadConfigFiles` calls `ClearPathCache` and `CheckDataDirOption` on `gArgs` rather than the current `ArgsManager` instance in the status quo.\r\n\r\nThe new files are nearly unchanged from their sources, so `git diff master --color-moved=dimmed-zebra` could be helpful.",

It also handles removing the snapshot chainstate data on-disk in the event that the snapshot fails to validate.\r\n\r\nAs detailed in [assumeutxo.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/assumeutxo.md#background-chainstate-hits-snapshot-base-block):\r\n\r\n> Once the tip of the background chainstate hits the base block of the snapshot chainstate, we stop use of the background chainstate by setting m_stop_use, in CompleteSnapshotValidation(), which is checked in ActivateBestChain()). We hash the background chainstate's UTXO set contents and ensure it matches the compiled value in CMainParams::m_assumeutxo_data.\r\n> \r\n> The background chainstate data lingers on disk until shutdown, when in ChainstateManager::Reset(), the background chainstate is cleaned up with ValidatedSnapshotShutdownCleanup(), which renames the chainstate_[hash] datadir as chainstate.\r\n>\r\n> **Failure consideration**: if bitcoind unexpectedly halts after m_stop_use is set on the background chainstate but before CompleteSnapshotValidation() can finish, the need to complete snapshot validation will be detected on subsequent init by ChainstateManager::CheckForUncleanShutdown().\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n~~Most of this change is unittested, though some logic (anything assuming on-disk leveldb data) can't be tested without some rework of unittest setup, given in-memory leveldb instances are used. I can look into how difficult this would be.~~\r\n\r\nThis change adds the ability to unittest using on-disk leveldb coins dbs.\r\n\r\n#### Possible follow-ups\r\n\r\n- [ ] Unify `CDBWrapper::{m_path,m_is_memory}`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24232#discussion_r855354180",

Adding another layer in the middle can only introduce problems, not solve it.\r\n\r\nEven though I understand your concerns, the claim that this is not solvable requires evidence, which is lacking here. I'm not even fully onboard on the idea that LevelDB is part of the \"consensus layer\", but I understand that LevelDB is part of the consensus library; after all it's a key/value store and it should be just that. The solution to this fear, however, is not keeping it untouched (because it was touched before, quite often over the last decade). But the solution is to quantify how it works and make it part of the protocol and run proper tests, like it has always been done in this repo. \r\n\r\nAnd I'm happy to do more to make this PR more appealing and address any concerns, whether it's tests or something else.

The first allows LevelDbOptions to destroy leveldb::Options members without CDBWrapper having to directly. The second change allows the leveldb::Env to be managed by penv. Both of these changes prevent a LeakSanitizer exception if the CDBWrapper ctor throws.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22592\r\n",

It's not hard to see how interface-behavior can be well-defined and tested.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n",
