    "body": "Add GitHub Codespaces integration.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it easier to onboard new contributors to Bitcoin Core by providing a web based development environment that is trivial to setup.\r\n\r\nBy starting a GitHub Codespace instance using this integration in this PR a developer gets access to a configured C++ IDE with typical IDE features such as working code completion, refactoring tools (rename function, etc.), etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition the IDE environment a Linux environment is spun up by GitHub Codespaces. This Linux environment is accessible via a web based terminal. A new developer can run say `make && src/bitcoind -regtest` in the web based terminal after making a small change and see the results of his/her work immediately while staying in the browser. Instant gratification! :)\r\n\r\nGitHub Codespaces is not magic. It is simply the combination of three things:\r\n\r\n* A web based editor/IDE\r\n* A web based terminal\r\n* Access to a private Linux instance which is accessible via said web based terminal\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### How to test this PR\r\n\r\nRequest access to GitHub Codespaces which is currently in beta:\r\n* Go to https://github.com/features/codespaces and apply: applications seem to be approved automatically within a day or two AFAICT.\r\n\r\nOnce you have beta access to GitHub Codespaces:\r\n* Go to https://github.com/codespaces.\r\n* Click \"Create your first codespace\".\r\n* You can now either enter a repo/branch you control which contains the commit from this PR, or you can use my demo repo `bitcoin-codespaces/bitcoin` and the branch `master`. I've setup the demo repo to allow for easy testing of this PR: [see this diff for the changes between `bitcoin-codespaces:master` and `bitcoin:master`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...bitcoin-codespaces:master). If/when this PR is merged `bitcoin/bitcoin` will be the repo to use of course :)\r\n* Click \"Create codespace\".\r\n* Wait until the initial setup finishes: this will take a couple of minutes on first run.\r\n* Enjoy your new web based IDE! Try making some small change, type `make && src/bitcoind -regtest` in the web based terminal and enjoy your work! :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/codespaces/codespace-overview.png\" />\r\n\r\n",

It's always \"someone else's computer\" and not really under your control. Which is not that great for a project with high security requirements.\r\n\r\nAll in all I think this can be great for some kind of projects (e.g. frontend ones), the have a fast feedback cycle, but I'm still skeptical this is a good idea for this project.",

Tinkering/experimenting in this context does not include making actual public contributions/code changes. Public contributions typically come at a much much later stage (way beyond initial tinkering/experimenting) when one has invested in a local setup.\r\n\r\nTo be clear: I am _not_ suggesting anyone should use this as a substitute for a proper local development setup. Also I'm _not_ suggesting that this should be part of any \"official\" recommended workflow for contributors or similar: if you don't have any use for these four dotfiles you should be able to safely ignore them :)",

This seems great, but I haven't tried it ~and think a demo link would be helpful~.\r\n\r\nHand wringing over this seems strange to me. If the main concern is this will cause spam and low quality contributions, that's an empirical question, not something we need to speculate about. If it causes spam and low quality PRs, it should be pretty obvious and easy to fix by reverting.\r\n\r\nBut I really don't understand what what the concerns about lock-in and dependencies and ecosystems mean in a practical sense. This is no different than providing a .gitignore or a .clang-format file, or an init startup script. It may in fact be true that our [bitcoind.service](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/init/bitcoind.service) file has sent many developers down a dark road and some are attending anonymous groups to support withdrawal from systemd. But I think people should be able to use the tools they want to use, and as long as it doesn't cause an unacceptable maintenance burden, we should support it and try not to get in the way. This PR definitely adds some maintenance burden and it should be maintainers decision whether they want to take it on. But this can be stated plainly as a maintainer preference not a \"really, we are protecting you from yourself\" moral principle.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Somehow I missed the \"How to test this PR\" section of the description. Will apply for access and try it out. It could definitely make sense to avoid merging the PR until the feature is more widely accessible.\r\n\r\n",
