    "body": "This is a rebase of #11639 with some fixes for the last few comments which were not yet addressed.\r\n\r\nThe original PR text, with some strikethroughs of text that is no longer correct:\r\n\r\n> This cleans up an old main-carryover - it made sense that main could decide what DoS scores to assign things because the DoS scores were handled in a different part of main, but now validation is telling net_processing what DoS scores to assign to different things, which is utter nonsense. Instead, we replace CValidationState's nDoS and CorruptionPossible with a general ValidationInvalidReason, which net_processing can handle as it sees fit. I keep the behavior changes here to a minimum, but in the future we can utilize these changes for other smarter behavior, such as disconnecting/preferring to rotate outbound peers based on them providing things which are invalid due to SOFT_FORK because we shouldn't ban for such cases.\r\n> \r\n> This is somewhat complementary with, though obviously conflicts heavily with #11523, which added enums in place of DoS scores, as well as a few other cleanups (which are still relevant).\r\n> \r\n> Compared with previous bans, the following changes are made:\r\n> \r\n> Txn with empty vin/vout or null prevouts move from 10 DoS\r\n> points to 100.\r\n> Loose transactions with a dependency loop now result in a ban\r\n> instead of 10 DoS points.\r\n> ~~BIP68-violation no longer results in a ban as it is SOFT_FORK.~~\r\n> ~~Non-SegWit SigOp violation no longer results in a ban as it\r\n> considers P2SH sigops and is thus SOFT_FORK.~~\r\n> ~~Any script violation in a block no longer results in a ban as\r\n> it may be the result of a SOFT_FORK. This should likely be\r\n> fixed in the future by differentiating between them.~~\r\n> Proof of work failure moves from 50 DoS points to a ban.\r\n> Blocks with timestamps under MTP now result in a ban, blocks\r\n> too far in the future continue to not result in a ban.\r\n> Inclusion of non-final transactions in a block now results in a\r\n> ban instead of 10 DoS points.\r\n\r\nNote: The change to ban all peers for consensus violations is actually NOT the change I'd like to make -- I'd prefer to only ban outbound peers in those situations.  The current behavior is a bit of a mess, however, and so in the interests of advancing this PR I tried to keep the changes to a minimum.  I plan to revisit the behavior in a followup PR.\r\n\r\nEDIT: One reviewer suggested I add some additional context for this PR:\r\n\r\n> The goal of this work was to make net_processing aware of the actual reasons for validation failures, rather than just deal with opaque numbers instructing it to do something.\r\n> \r\n> In the future, I'd like to make it so that we use more context to decide how to punish a peer. One example is to differentiate inbound and outbound peer misbehaviors. Another potential example is if we'd treat RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE failures differently (ie after the next consensus change is implemented), and perhaps again we'd want to treat some peers differently than others.",

Then have a sequence of small followup commits which each add a few enum values at a time, passing them through state.Invalid() and translating them into Misbehaving() calls, where each commit is self contained and is deals with related reasons so it is easy to spot and understand changes in behavior.\r\n\r\nIf this is a bad idea, or too much work, I'd be ok with trying to review this PR as it is, but I wanted to suggest something to be able to have more confidence in it, and to maybe make it easier to find other reviewers.\r\n\r\n- [X] a5415e85caaf2f5a77d6bae9574bb6d21139ee34 Add useful-for-dos \"reason\" field to CValidationState (1/8)\r\n- [X] 33213ad4ed9c5cef893285a7880ca708fb86a4ff Add functions to convert CValidationInterface's reason to DoS info (2/8)\r\n- [ ] 6bdc4491e06433eb380ca3b8bc3e7c15f06aee8b Use new reason-based DoS/disconnect logic instead of state.nDoS (3/8)\r\n- [ ] 963699d1316f6b14c98a4624f766393379db85e1 Use state reason field to check for collisions in cmpctblocks (4/8)\r\n- [ ] 06e4247ede5d052c9680f9bacee6ec52b83cc097 Prep for scripted-diff by removing some \\ns which annoy sed.

      "body": "> Started reviewing this, but IMO, the way this PR is structured makes it difficult to verify that it doesn't unintentionally change behavior.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I've had a go at redoing the patchset to try to make the (potential) functionality changes more clear: https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/201901-dosreasons\r\n\r\nThis has (I think) all the behaviour changes first:\r\n\r\n    d9451de0d0 drop obsolete comment\r\n    acdb469525 [refactor] stateDummy -> orphan_state\r\n    5cd7a4d338 [refactor] Use maybepunish etc\r\n    0d1d471eac [refactor] drop IsInvalid(nDoSOut)\r\n    a0776a5d8a set nDoS rather than bumping it\r\n    e0cff4e133 Clean up banning levels\r\n\r\nbefore introducing the new reason field, along with checks that the implied DoS value for each reason matches the actual DoS values presented/used:\r\n\r\n    89e8dea284 [refactor] Add useful-for-dos \"reason\" field to CValidationState\r\n\r\nwhich then allows dropping the instance variables:\r\n\r\n    27089e55be [refactor] Drop redundant nDoS, corruptionPossible, SetCorruptionPossible\r\n\r\nThen the code is changed to use reasons directly:\r\n\r\n    15d9023106 LookupBlockIndex -> CACHED_INVALID\r\n    519fb78934 CorruptionPossible -> TX_WITNESS_MUTATED\r\n    221d17f332 CorruptionPossible -> BLOCK_MUTATED\r\n    32747d0746 [refactor] Use Reasons directly instead of DoS codes\r\n\r\nAnd the now obsolete DoS/etc stuff is dropped:\r\n\r\n    4d110a59c6 [refactor] Prep for scripted-diff by removing some \\ns which annoy sed.\r\n    9a89a47257 scripted-diff: Remove DoS calls to CValidationState\r\n    327591b016 [refactor] Drop unused state.DoS(), state.GetDoS(), state.CorruptionPossible()\r\n\r\nThat leaves a couple more things:\r\n\r\n    94cf0deffb [refactor] Update some comments in validation.cpp as we arent doing DoS there\r\n    04c6b24a66 [refactor] swap if/else order\r\n    96f0ee075d remaining commits vs 94874ddfdf4ae9c4b10f3f91d5e3280e2c24c371\r\n\r\nbut finally ends up with the same code as this PR (minus the latest commit anyway).\r\n\r\nAnyway I think this approach might be easier to review? It could also allow splitting the PR into two -- one making the changes to DoS behaviour but not changing the way DoS works; followed by a second PR that actually adds the Reasons and refactors but doesn't change behaviour.\r\n\r\n(Proof of concept only: bunches of these commits should probably be combined, commit messages need improvement, and I think I lost a bunch of authorship info)\r\n\r\nEDIT: \r\n\r\nI've added an extra commit prior to the DoS->Invalid refactor, namely \"5b15205883 Allow use of state.Invalid() for all reasons\" that avoids assertions that Invalid() is only used for DoS-level-0 problems failing.\r\n\r\nThat just leaves one test failure in the intermediate commits; feature_block.py fails after the changing the DoS levels but before adding the \"reason\" code. I think this is due to lowering `bad-txns-inputs-missingorspent` from 100 to 0 with the tests still expecting a disconnect when that happens in a block. Adding the reasons fixes this because that includes code to update that problem from 0/TX_MISSING_INPUTS to 100/CONSENSUS when it affects a block rather than a loose transaction. (And similarly, the tests are adujsted to expect disconnects due to premature coinbase spends, but that functionality only occurs as part of the 0/TX to 100/CONS step)",

      "body": "One overall comment: it seems there is a subset of `ValidationInvalidReason`s that are valid for transactions, and another subset that is valid for blocks. Perhaps it's useful to have functions to test whether one belongs to those sets, and invoke those functions in assertions after validation returns in their respective contexts. That seems a bit more future-proof than just having comments of the form \"CheckTxInputs may return MISSING_INPUTS but we can't return that\". It would make me also a bit more comfortable with changes to checks from `CorruptionPossible()` to testing for a specific invalidity reason (assuming we know `TX_WITNESS_MUTATED` in the only tx-valid corruptionpossible one, and `BLOCK_MUTATED` the only block-valid corruptionpossible one).",

I agree with @TheBlueMatt that some of the intermediate commits introduce behaviour changes and should be changed or squashed.\r\n\r\nI have a branch here https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2019_04_clean_up_banning that rebases everything up to _Clean up banning levels_ on master, fixes a bunch of nits, expands comments and maintains existing p2p behaviour (except in the last commit which updates DoS scores). I think to make progress on this, we could open that as a separate PR as suggested by AJ here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15141#issuecomment-478474586. @sdaftuar I'm happy to open the PR if that helps you.",

I'll repeat that here to make sure everyone is aware of this (but I don't think it's necessary to repeat this in a commit message or in a comment in an intermediate commit).\r\n\r\nPlease re-review.  While the commit history has been rewritten to fix several bugs, the overall diff of what has been previously ACK'ed by some reviewers to the current version is still pretty small (modulo the rebase to master that happened in between).",

Only non-obvious code change in overall diff was updating CONSENSUS -> BLOCK_INVALID_HEADER for https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15141#discussion_r273663169. Internal commits have other changes. \"Refactor misbehavior ban decisions\" commit has a new workaround to keep banning invalid headers in CMPCTBLOCK messages until BLOCK_INVALID_HEADER reason is handled later in \"Refactor misbehavior ban decisions to MaybePunishNode\" commit. \"Clean up banning levels\" commit now does not add a ban on premature coinbase spend, but this happens in later 'Add useful-for-dos \"reason\"' commit. The \"set nDoS rather than bumping it\" commit is dropped. The \"Refactor misbehavior ban decisions\" commit has had some later cleanups squashed in.",

      "body": "I think it's worth updating the git commit log in 088336aa3cab566a6418fb2e88824bdf668b8458 (_[refactor] Add useful-for-dos \"reason\" field to CValidationState_) to say that previously, blocks which had a transaction that failed a non-p2sh pre-segwit softfork would not result in a ban, but now will. I also think that you should remove the `[refactor]` tag for a commit which isn't a pure refactor and changes p2p behaviour.\r\n\r\n> Also, @jnewbery pointed out somewhere (I seem to have lost the link to the comment) that reviewers should take note that DoS scores would accumulate, while the switch to Reason enums eliminates that potential accumulation, so reviewers should carefully check that the behavior changes that result are only the ones claimed in the PR. I'll repeat that here to make sure everyone is aware of this (but I don't think it's necessary to repeat this in a commit message or in a comment in an intermediate commit).\r\n\r\ngit commit logs are basically free (there's almost no downside to being more verbose in them) and I often look at old commit logs for motivation/justification for changes. If you do change your mind and decide to include a justification in the commit, then the commit log from my branch was:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis PR also introduces a subtle change in the way nDoS is set on\r\nCValidationState objects. Instead of incrementing the nDoS score when\r\nDoS() is called, the nDoS is set to the new value. This would\r\npotentially be a behavior change if DoS() were called more than once on\r\nthe same CValidationState object. To verify that this is not a behavior\r\nchange, check that DoS() is never called more than once on the same\r\nCValidationState object.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to make that change *really* easy to review, you could change the commit order so that all calls to `state.DoS(0...` are changed to `state.Invalid(...` before that commit. That means that the only call to `state.DoS(...` where the `nDoS` isn't 100 is the 'missing inputs' failure. Reviewers would only need to verify that the `CValidationState` set there hasn't already been set before, since calling `state.DoS(100, ...` has the same effect before and after that commit. (I'm not saying you should do that now, but it might aid other reviewers to see that that is equivalent to the final state of this PR).",

      "body": "> I think it's worth updating the git commit log in 088336a ([refactor] Add useful-for-dos \"reason\" field to CValidationState) to say that previously, blocks which had a transaction that failed a non-p2sh pre-segwit softfork would not result in a ban, but now will. I also think that you should remove the [refactor] tag for a commit which isn't a pure refactor and changes p2p behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis behavior change (where a node running with `-par=1` would potentially not ban for a block with invalid scripts, to now always banning regardless of whether `-par=1` or not) being present in that refactor commit was an oversight; I've moved it to its own commit.\r\n\r\nPrior version of the code is here: [15141.13](https://github.com/sdaftuar/bitcoin/commits/15141.13).  Once again there should be no diff in the final code.\r\n\r\nRegarding this:\r\n```This PR also introduces a subtle change in the way nDoS is set on\r\nCValidationState objects. Instead of incrementing the nDoS score when\r\nDoS() is called, the nDoS is set to the new value.\r\n```\r\nI actually dropped the commit (at Matt's request) where nDoS would not be incremented, so that the `assert()`'s that @ajtowns had suggested (comparing the DoS score to the reason enum) should be an effective reminder to the reviewer that incrementing is not taking place.\r\n\r\n",

provides more elaboration:\r\n- `ValidationInvalidReason::TX_PREMATURE_SPEND` is non-standard in `AcceptToMemoryPoolWorker` (two occurences) but invalid in `Consensus::CheckTxInputs`\r\n- `ValidationInvalidReason::BLOCK_INVALID_HEADER` maps to  `REJECT_OBSOLETE` (when concerning block versions)  or `REJECT_INVALID`(everything else)\r\n- `ValidationInvalidReason::TX_MEMPOOL_POLICY` maps to various different REJECT reasons\r\n- `ValidationInvalidReason::TX_NOT_STANDARD` maps to either high fee or nonstandard\r\n",

RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE is one such possible example (though we're not using it in this PR and I am not sure we ever will); the BLOCK_INVALID_HEADER enum I added is another (net_processing needs to be able to distinguish some headers failures from others, in order to maintain the current ban behavior).\r\n\r\nAnyway I'll update this comment to be clearer.",

      "body": "This is actually a behavior change from existing behavior, but hopefully a relatively harmless one.  Here's the relevant snippet from master:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2945492424934fa360f86b116184ee8e34f19d0a/src/net_processing.cpp#L1552-L1585\r\n\r\nIt's a bit hard to decipher because of the multiple layers going on here, but basically `punish_duplicate_invalid` is only set to true for outbound and non-manual peers relaying us headers outside of HB compact block mode, and `nDoS` is set to 0 for the cached-invalid case:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2945492424934fa360f86b116184ee8e34f19d0a/src/validation.cpp#L3341-L3357\r\n\r\nSo this does indeed result in a ban rather than just a disconnect for an outbound peer that announces an invalid header.  If there's no reason that this is materially worse than other ban behaviors that exist, then I think I'd prefer to stick with this behavior change for now, and try to improve ban-behavior globally after this PR (which should become much easier, now that banning is contained to one place in the code in a more understandable way).\r\n\r\nI can update the comment though to make this clearer.",

It seems cleaner and less error prone to keep MaybePunishNode and MayResultInDisconnect both implemented in terms of the same nice `GetDoSForReason` function added in ac3873e2a92457995f7e5a9e5fc24352af360c6b (renamed to `GetDos` in 6e3332a76f227b6dd6068513807934fd1b3d936b), than to duplicate the logic between these two functions and duplicate LOCK/Misbehaving stuff within this function.\r\n\r\nI would drop this commit entirely. The only parts of it that seem worth keeping are the added function comments, and these would make more sense as part of 4159f7ca7b449195f0e8a3f67a4045409c703e9d which adds the functions. Keeping GetDos would also reduce the churn in this PR and simplify the later 8e4590e522d4903d970cdaafb95e4fdfccf792fb commit.",

One example is to differentiate inbound and outbound peer misbehaviors.  Another potential example is if we'd treat RECENT_CONSENSUS_CHANGE failures differently (ie after the next consensus change is implemented), and perhaps again we'd want to treat some peers differently than others.\r\n\r\nI do think that the `MayResultInDisconnect` logic was not very useful, and in the latest version I've vastly simplified things to reflect that we only use this for deciding whether to relay transactions from whitelisted peers.  So there should be much less code duplication now.",
