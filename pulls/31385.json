    "body": "Broadens the package validation interface, see #27463 for wider context.\r\n\r\nOn master, package rules include that (1) the package topology must be child-wth-parents (2) all of the child's unconfirmed parents must be present. This PR relaxes the second rule, leaving the first rule untouched (there are plans to change the second rule, but not here).\r\n\r\nOriginal motivation for this rule was based on the idea that we would have a child-with-unconfirmed-parents package relay protocol, and this would verify that the peer provided the \"correct\" package. For various reasons, we're not planning on doing this. We could potentially do this for ancestor packages (with a similar definition that all UTXOs to make the tx valid are available in this package), but it's also questionable whether it's useful to enforce this.\r\n\r\nThis rule gets in the way of certain usage of 1p1c package relay currently. If a transaction has multiple parents, of which only 1 requires a package CPFP, this rule blocks the package from relaying. Even if all the non-low-feerate parents are already in mempool, when the p2p logic submits the 1p1c package, it gets rejected for not meeting this rule.",

However, we are not planning to introduce a protocol where\npeers would be asked to send these packages.\n\nThis rule has downsides: if a transaction has multiple parents but only\n1 that requires package CPFP to be accepted, the current rule prevents\nus from accepting that package. Even if the other parents are already in\nmempool, the p2p logic will only submit the 1p1c package, which fails\nthis check. See the test in p2p_1p1c_network.py",
