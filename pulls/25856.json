    "body": "According to BIP-174, the tap_tree field must be:\r\n\r\n> One or more tuples representing the depth, leaf version, and script for a leaf in the Taproot tree, allowing the entire tree to be reconstructed. The tuples must be in depth first search order so that the tree is correctly reconstructed. Each tuple is an 8-bit unsigned integer representing the depth in the Taproot tree for this script, an 8-bit unsigned integer representing the leaf version, the length of the script as a compact size unsigned integer, and the script itself.\r\n\r\nallowing serializing an empty tap tree tuple breaks the \"one or more\"ness of the field, so serializations should ignore empty but initialized tap_trees.\r\n\r\nsee also https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/pull/1194, where this caused downstream issues.\r\n",

In that case, we should reject the empty taptree during parsing rather than accepting the ostensibly bad PSBT and silently dropping the bad field. The general principle for PSBT is if it came in or if we filled the field internally, then it should be serialized. So changing the serialization in this way is incorrect IMO. Rather we should not accept empty taptrees and make it impossible to add one to the psbt in our own processing.",

Otherwise the tapleaf \"script\" is simply an uninterpreted string of bytes.\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects the issue where the type `CScript` is used prior to the tapleaf version being known to be a tapscript.  This prevents `CScript` methods from erroneously being called on non-tapscript data.\r\n\r\nA second commit abstracts out the TapBranch hash computation in the same manner that the TapLeaf computation is already abstracted.  These two abstractions ensure that the TapLeaf and TapBranch tagged hashes are always constructed properly.",
