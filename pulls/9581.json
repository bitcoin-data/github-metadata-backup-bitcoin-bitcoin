Then a more general discussion can happen about wether this is something we even want to do. As soon as you start half-enforcing style/formatting, you can just end up with \"fix-up\" pull-requests ever 2 weeks; while continuously breaking patches etc.\r\n\r\nMultiple single commit pull requests that only change formatting/styling/trivial things etc are not preferred, as each one requires review, and generates noise in an already pull-request flooded (with not enough people reviewing) repository.\r\n\r\nContributions are always welcome, but please be mindful of the workload you could be creating for others (especially so close to a feature freeze). If possible, combine batches of smaller, related changes into single pull requests. If needed, a single important change can always be broken out, as already happens with the back-porting we do.",

We already had cleanup pulls which changed to a max line length to 80 chars among other things. It turned out the patch was impossible to review, actually changed behavior and would have introduced bugs. I'd rather have \"ugly\" code that works than some PEP8 code that crashes.\r\n\r\nSounds good? :-)",

          "title": "Add basic_style.py to automate some style checking.",
          "body": "As discussed recently in #9581 and in referenced past discussions #6839, #6156, and probably a bunch of other places too, there is concern about the long tail of effort and risk involved with these style fix-up PRs. To summarize what has been articulated by the experienced maintainers:\r\n\r\n1) it is a lot of PR clutter for reviewers/maintainers to sift through\r\n2) it impedes release management since style fix-ups often have difficult merge conflicts with more important content\r\n3) they are sometimes hard to review and bugs can slip in\r\n4) they permanently clutter up output from `git blame` and other history tools\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that the ideal long-term strategy is to automate detection of these style issues as much as possible such that the CI system can auto-check every PR. This will ensure that the code is kept clean and consistent at source and is kept that way for all time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the message I am getting from what has been written is that the strategy for bringing this online needs to be done **properly** or **not at all**. It will require a conscientious effort to minimize the impact to ongoing activities and steps should be taken to make damn sure it is not the cause of any bugs. I have some thoughts, but collecting ideas from all around is good (and thanks for all that has already been written, it is quite helpful for thinking this through). I am content leaving this PR to sit until a larger collection of automation scripts are complete and we have a strategy that the maintainers are on board with.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR provides an example script for very basic style checks which are expressed as simple regular expressions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSTYLE_RULES = [\r\n    {'title':   'No tabstops',\r\n     'applies': ['*.c', '*.cpp', '*.h', '*.py', '*.sh'],\r\n     'regex':   '\\t',\r\n     'fix':     '    '},\r\n    {'title':   'No trailing whitespace on a line',\r\n     'applies': ['*.c', '*.cpp', '*.h', '*.py', '*.sh'],\r\n     'regex':   ' \\n',\r\n     'fix':     '\\n'},\r\n    {'title':   'No more than three consecutive newlines',\r\n     'applies': ['*.c', '*.cpp', '*.h', '*.py', '*.sh'],\r\n     'regex':   '\\n\\n\\n\\n',\r\n     'fix':     '\\n\\n\\n'},\r\n    {'title':   'Do not end a line with a semicolon',\r\n     'applies': ['*.py'],\r\n     'regex':   ';\\n',\r\n     'fix':     '\\n'},\r\n    {'title':   'Do not end a line with two semicolons',\r\n     'applies': ['*.c', '*.cpp', '*.h'],\r\n     'regex':   ';;\\n',\r\n     'fix':     ';\\n'},\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script provides a `report` subcommand that gives an overview of the state of the repository. It also provides a `check` command, which like in #9459, provides a shell status code (to make it easy to hook to TravisCI) and also gives pointers to what needs to be done to resolve the issue. Finally it provides a `fix` command which just does a search-and-replace according to the 'fix' string in the above `STYLE_RULES` dictionary.\r\n\r\nThe master branch has 141 files that fail this set of rules (19 + 93 + 16 + 13 + 0). However, I did not include the fixup in this PR due to the aforementioned reasons. The script can do the edit by invoking `contrib/devtools/basic_style.py fix .`.\r\n\r\n`clang-format`, `pep8`, `pylint`, `coverity`, clang static analyzer, etc. are what I would define as 'non-basic' style checks that can be similarly automated (and might actually make this one redundant). Also, the `copyright_header.py` script in #9452/#9459 could be part of the end result too.",
