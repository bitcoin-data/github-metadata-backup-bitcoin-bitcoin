    "body": "Follow-up to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29412. Before 29412, we were logging an error when receiving an unknown mutated block with a valid PoW. With 29412, we only log about mutated blocks to the `net` debug logging category. As the mutated block logging is and has been useful for detecting and debugging problem of some mining pools, it's re-added here. See the conversation starting here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29412#issuecomment-1971206525.\r\n\r\nOld blocks can cheaply be mutated and send to us. We don't log when receiving these. However, blocks with a valid PoW (above our DoS threshold) that we didn't know about could indicate a problem, for example, on the miner side. By logging about these mutated blocks, we make it easier to notice and debug these cases.",

I agree with that sentiment and think it would be beneficial to make this explicit by renaming the inherited function.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for `ConstructBlockHash()`.",
