See what causes RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR, sound like really bad excpetions.\r\n\r\nI think either is fine. bitcoind should always be able to write to its data directory, so I would say failure to do so counts as an internal error.\r\n\r\n> Concept ACK, but I don't like the tests.\r\n\r\nI also don't like the test framework messing with bitcoind's data directory. I don't think the failure testcase is necessary. If bitcoind can't write to its datadirectory, there are more pressing issues than the RPC raising the correct error.\r\n\r\nAgree with @MarcoFalke that it might be a good idea to combine this with the mempool_persist.py test (if it can be done tidily).",
