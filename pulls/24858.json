    "body": "Fixes #21379.\r\n\r\nThe blocks/blk?????.dat files are mutated and become increasingly malformed, or corrupt, as a result of running the re-indexing process.\r\nThe mutations occur after the re-indexing process has finished, as new blocks are appended, but are a result of a re-indexing process miscalculation that lingers in the block manager's `m_blockfile_info` `nSize` data until node restart.\r\nThese additions to the blk files are non-fatal, but also not desirable.\r\nThat is, this is a form of data corruption that the reading code is lenient enough to process (it skips the extra bytes), but it adds some scary looking log messages as it encounters them.\r\n\r\nThe summary of the problem is that the re-index process double counts the size of the serialization header (magic message start bytes [4 bytes] + length [4 bytes] = 8 bytes) while calculating the blk data file size (both values already account for the serialization header's size, hence why it is over accounted).\r\n\r\nThis bug manifests itself in a few different ways, after re-indexing, when a new block from a peer is processed:\r\n1. If the new block will not fit into the last blk file processed while re-indexing, while remaining under the 128MiB limit, then the blk file is flushed to disk and truncated to a size that is 8 greater than it should be. The truncation adds zero bytes (see `FlatFileSeq::Flush` and `TruncateFile`).\r\n1. If the last blk file processed while re-indexing has logical space for the new block under the 128 MiB limit:\r\n    1. If the blk file was not already large enough to hold the new block, then the zeros are, in effect, added by `fseek` when the file is opened for writing. Eight zero bytes are added to the end of the last blk file just before the new block is written. This happens because the write offset is 8 too great due to the miscalculation. The result is 8 zero bytes between the end of the last block and the beginning of the next block's magic + length + block.\r\n    1. If the blk file was already large enough to hold the new block, then the current existing file contents remain in the 8 byte gap between the end of the last block and the beginning of the next block's magic + length + block. Commonly, when this occcurs, it is due to the blk file containing blocks that are not connected to the block tree during reindex and are thus left behind by the reindex process and later overwritten when new blocks are added. The orphaned blocks can be valid blocks, but due to the nature of concurrent block download, the parent may not have been retrieved and written by the time the node was previously shutdown.",

I apologize in advance if this is already a known\nissue.\n\nThe issue can be demonstrated as follows:\n1) bitcoind and bitcoin-qt version v0.9.2.1 on Linux, disconnected from internet.\n2) create empty ~/.bitcoin directory and cd to it.\n3) bitcoind &\n     - exits because no bitcoin.conf and default arg -server=1 and no rpc setup\n4) create bitcoin.conf with these entries:\n     reindex=0\n     txindex=1\n     server=0\n5) bitcoin-qt &\n    - Click OK in popup about rebuilding block database\n    - File->exit\n6) copy beginning ~1kB of bootstrap.dat to ~/.bitcoin\n7) bitcoin-qt &\n     - File->exit\n~/.bitcoin/debug.log should contain this:\n2014-09-30 03:52:40 LoadBlockIndexDB(): last block file = 0\n2014-09-30 03:52:40 LoadBlockIndexDB(): last block file info: CBlockFileInfo(blocks=2, size=586, heights=0...0, time=2009-01-03...2009-01-03)\n2014-09-30 03:52:40 LoadBlockIndexDB(): transaction index enabled\n\n$ od -A x -t x1 blocks/blk00000.dat | head -40\n000000 f9 be b4 d9 1d 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n000010 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n000020 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3b a3 ed fd\n000030 7a 7b 12 b2 7a c7 2c 3e 67 76 8f 61 7f c8 1b c3\n000040 88 8a 51 32 3a 9f b8 aa 4b 1e 5e 4a 29 ab 5f 49\n000050 ff ff 00 1d 1d ac 2b 7c 01 01 00 00 00 01 00 00\n000060 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n000070 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ff ff\n000080 ff ff 4d 04 ff ff 00 1d 01 04 45 54 68 65 20 54\n000090 69 6d 65 73 20 30 33 2f 4a 61 6e 2f 32 30 30 39\n0000a0 20 43 68 61 6e 63 65 6c 6c 6f 72 20 6f 6e 20 62\n0000b0 72 69 6e 6b 20 6f 66 20 73 65 63 6f 6e 64 20 62\n0000c0 61 69 6c 6f 75 74 20 66 6f 72 20 62 61 6e 6b 73\n0000d0 ff ff ff ff 01 00 f2 05 2a 01 00 00 00 43 41 04\n0000e0 67 8a fd b0 fe 55 48 27 19 67 f1 a6 71 30 b7 10\n0000f0 5c d6 a8 28 e0 39 09 a6 79 62 e0 ea 1f 61 de b6\n000100 49 f6 bc 3f 4c ef 38 c4 f3 55 04 e5 1e c1 12 de\n000110 5c 38 4d f7 ba 0b 8d 57 8a 4c 70 2b 6b f1 1d 5f\n000120 ac 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n000130 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n*\n000240 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 f9 be b4 d9 d7 00\n000250 00 00 01 00 00 00 6f e2 8c 0a b6 f1 b3 72 c1 a6\n000260 a2 46 ae 63 f7 4f 93 1e 83 65 e1 5a 08 9c 68 d6\n000270 19 00 00 00 00 00 98 20 51 fd 1e 4b a7 44 bb be\n000280 68 0e 1f ee 14 67 7b a1 a3 c3 54 0b f7 b1 cd b6\n000290 06 e8 57 23 3e 0e 61 bc 66 49 ff ff 00 1d 01 e3\n0002a0 62 99 01 01 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n0002b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n0002c0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff 07 04 ff ff\n0002d0 00 1d 01 04 ff ff ff ff 01 00 f2 05 2a 01 00 00\n0002e0 00 43 41 04 96 b5 38 e8 53 51 9c 72 6a 2c 91 e6\n0002f0 1e c1 16 00 ae 13 90 81 3a 62 7c 66 fb 8b e7 94\n000300 7b e6 3c 52 da 75 89 37 95 15 d4 e0 a6 04 f8 14\n000310 17 81 e6 22 94 72 11 66 bf 62 1e 73 a8 2c bf 23\n000320 42 c8 58 ee ac 00 00 00 00 f9 be b4 d9 d7 00 00\nNote: zero-padding from 293(0x125) to 585(0x249) \n",

You're very close and you have the right idea. The exact line where they come from is in `CChainState::LoadExternalBlockFile` at the line `dbp->nPos = nBlockPos;` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L4288\r\nThat is why blindly adding another 8 on the call to `FindBlockPos` in `BlockManager::SaveBlockToDisk` is wrong for already known blocks.",

For example, this issue deals with the cases where reads fail, and get skipped, in-between blocks. The case where no subsequent blocks get imported is where an actual block read fails and that makes every subsequent block appear to be out of order. That's a different thing.\r\n\r\n> does it reverse already padded blk.dats\r\n\r\nNo, this change does not attempt to alter the block files if an error is found (and skipped). This change attempts to stop setting up data that is used by later processing which winds up corrupting the block files.\r\n\r\nI'd like to keep this change focused on fixing the original issue and not trying to re-design the import processes.",

      "body": "@ryanofsky Thanks for the review. I've put updates related to your comments into 011f6ec54fffb7600ae300851cc9816423f3f4dd. I'll squash the commits after positive code review of these.\r\n\r\nI still like what I have in `SaveBlockToDisk` regarding what is passed into `FindBlockPos` for the second parameter, `nAddSize`. When the position and size is known, we pass that in. When only size is known, we pass in block size + header size because we know that's what we'll have to add to the file. And, by doing it this way, we don't have to re-adjust the known position on the way out of `SaveBlockToDisk`. We will never pass the same position into `FindBlockPos` for a given block because we either don't know the position, or we pass in where we found the block. The only question is whether we should pass in the positon  that `FindBlockPos` previously returned. I don't see the advantage to doing that because it's kind of like trying to pretend that we don't know what we do know.",

This is a disturbing bug with an easy fix which seems well-worth merging.\r\n\r\n> I still like what I have in `SaveBlockToDisk` regarding what is passed into `FindBlockPos` for the second parameter, `nAddSize`. When the position and size is known, we pass that in. When only size is known, we pass in block size + header size because we know that's what we'll have to add to the file.\r\n\r\nTo me, this sounds more complicated that just passing the same size.\r\n\r\n> And, by doing it this way, we don't have to re-adjust the known position on the way out of `SaveBlockToDisk`.\r\n\r\nThis is inaccurate because WriteBlockToDisk is adjusting the position here if dbp is null. Instead of SaveBlockToDisk sometimes adjusting the position, and sometimes not adjusting it, I think it is clearer if SaveBlockToDisk always adjusts the position as in https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commit/07c05a1b24bf42e57f8c229f505ed448a6df81f7. Just making the adjustment in SaveBlockToDisk explicit at all is improvement. I'm pretty sure I stared at this code for an hour before I noticed the hidden adjustment in WriteBlockToDisk that was critical to making it work.\r\n\r\n> We will never pass the same position into `FindBlockPos` for a given block because we either don't know the position, or we pass in where we found the block. The only question is whether we should pass in the positon  that `FindBlockPos` previously returned. I don't see the advantage to doing that because it's kind of like trying to pretend that we don't know what we do know.\r\n\r\nI don't know why you are mentioning the position-not-known case because that is the working case, not the broken case, and no change we are discussing affects it. Also no code is \"trying to pretend\" anything in that case that I can see.\r\n\r\nThe advantage to passing the same position to FindBlockPos that it previously returned is that code is easier to explain and less likely to break if a variable has one meaning within a function, instead of two different meanings. This bug is **directly** caused by two different position values being used for the same block in FindBlockPos. You are working around two different position values being for being used for the same block by introducing two different size values for the same block. I think if we just used just one position and one size for a block in FindBlockPos, code would be easier to understand and less fragile.",

I'd have to review and test those changes closer, but at a glance, they seem plausible. They are close to my original fix in that they keep the change within `FindBlockPos`. I changed to the current approach trying to be responsive to feedback in April. I'd probably avoid adding comments in any potential future commit as those seem to cause a relatively large amount of friction. The current commit has gathered review, testing, and works, so I hate to start the process all over again. But, if this fix isn't going to get merged for some reason, then let me know and I'll do it.",

Maybe that would be a little bit clearer than adding and substracting 8.\r\n\r\nIn general, such a high percentage of code in  `FindBlockPos()` is conditional on `fKnown` or `!fKnown` that I wonder whether it would make sense to refactor this into two separate functions (not here, but as a possible follow-up).",

This bug has been around for about 7 years, and maybe more if you count the bugs that the last fix tried to handle. So, there are probably a lot of blk files that have been _recoverably_ corrupted (i.e. corrupted in a way that is still processable). To me, it's more of a notification for a concerned node operator that really cares about having a clean set of blk files. The new message gives the exact offset to go look, and maybe edit the file, if you really want to. But, The existing message doesn't really do much to help the operator. It kind of just scares them, even though the processing goes on. Maybe there is a balance that we need to hit. But, I'm not sure what that looks like besides this right now.",

The bug in the previous version of the code was not that it was passing the wrong *length* when _dbp_ is non-null. The bug was that it was passing the wrong _position_. (It was passing a different position than the one the original FindBlockPos call returned when the block was first written). Fixing the new position being 8 bytes ahead by making the length 8 bytes shorter seems fragile because it assumes FindBlockPos will be ok with this. Better to just pass later FindBlockPos calls the same position earlier calls returned, than work around this by passing a different length.\r\n\r\nI also think this comment is a little confusing, and that it's generally not helpful for comments to describe bugs in previous versions of the code that are no longer present. Information about the bug is helpful in the other part of the commit to understand the log statement, but I think is just distracting here in this part of the code.\r\n\r\nSuggested an alternate version of this fix in https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commit/07c05a1b24bf42e57f8c229f505ed448a6df81f7",

      "body": "Thanks for the review. I can see it both ways. I'm not feeling a big difference either way. To me, it kind of feels like two sides of the same coin.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm thinking is that `BlockManager::FindBlockPos` is multi-purpose. It's kind of funky because of how much within that method is conditioned upon the position being known, or not.\r\nIn one use, it's trying to figure out a spot where it can put the new header + block into a block file while respecting the file size limit.\r\nIn another use, it's trying to compute where it should put new blocks once we're done processing blocks that we already have in a file.\r\nSince in the second use, it knows the actual position and the block size, it can make sense why the passed in size to add, `nAddSize`, is different between the two invocations.\r\n\r\nThanks for providing an example of what you envisoned (07c05a1b24bf42e57f8c229f505ed448a6df81f7).\r\nI kind of like my commit because I don't have to go back and add the header size.\r\nBut, I can also see what you're saying about passing `FindBlockPos` the same positions that it returns.\r\nI'm undecided. Any other thoughts?\r\n\r\nLastly, I'm fine with trimming the comment to take out the info about past bug.\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks for looking at this. I agree, it's likely an overly broad try-catch block and that it's difficult to reason about what types of exceptions might be thrown, and from where, since there is no compile time concept of \"checked\" exceptions, like in Java. This is why I don't want to try changing it for this PR :-) I'm sure I'll miss something and it'll break at runtime. And, it'll just make the patch larger without impacting the usefulness of this specific fix.\r\n\r\nI can see that `blkdat >> block;` will throw at least `std::ios_base::failure` from at least a couple different places within the deserialization code. These are the exceptions that the original issue reported.",

Would suggest a comment that says why the code is using a different size in each case. Could use:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// When position_known is false, the CBlock has not been written to the\r\n// disk yet, so the nBlockSize value passed to FindBlockPos needs to be\r\n// set so FindBlockPos allocates enough bytes for the CBlock data *plus*\r\n// the size of the header WriteBlockToDisk will write before the CBlock\r\n// data.\r\n//\r\n// When position_known is true, WriteBlockToDisk will have already been\r\n// called, and it will have adjusted blockPos.nPos to point to the CBlock\r\n// data after the header, instead of to the header, so the nBlockSize\r\n// value passed to FindBlockPos should only include the CBlock size,\r\n// *not* the header size.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI still prefer the approach of passing a consistent size and position to FindBlockPos like https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commit/07c05a1b24bf42e57f8c229f505ed448a6df81f7 instead of dealing with an inconsistent position value by introducing an inconsistent size value. But both approaches have the same ultimate effect, so the more important thing is to document the code clearly.",

      "body": "I don't have a strong preference - it seems that both approaches only affect the blockstorage-internal logic, and since neither solution changes the public interface `SaveBlockToDisk`, this sholdn't change what external places will need to know: In particular, that if they pass `dbp!=nullptr`, dbp needs to point right after the header and before the block data (which should be documented in `SaveBlockToDisk` imo).\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that the internal function `FindBlockPos()` would be clearer if it was split up depending on whether the block is known, with so much code being conditional on it: If `dbp!=nullptr` , the function doesn't \"find\" anything new but only updates the block info statistics (and sometimes does a Flush which I'm not convinced is necessary). I had an initial go at this in https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/commits/202207_refactor_findblockpos , which is outside the scope of this PR, but might make sense as a follow-up.",

As a result of this, this (the second) test call to `SaveBlockToDisk` causes `m_blockfile_info.nBlocks` to increment to 2 [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6dc3084eec912cf2abfe18d1c05655defaa45e20/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L615), which is strange, since there's only one block. \r\n\r\nThis doesn't cause any problems now, but some future change could cause this test to break in mysterious ways. \r\n\r\nA way to fix this would be to allocate a new `BlockManager` (and probably `CChain`) for this call, to simulate restarting the node. (The third call to `SaveBlockToDisk`, below, can use the same ones as this one does, because following a reindex, the real node does go ahead and start adding new blocks.)\r\n\r\nIn case it's not clear, I updated that [commit](https://github.com/LarryRuane/bitcoin/commit/e8b90d475b193c1c1b1a74d7751c9ec830c82867) (containing other suggestions) to show what I mean.",
