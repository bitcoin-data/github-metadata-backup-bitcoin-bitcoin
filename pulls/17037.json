    "body": "And bip70 name.\r\nAnd on demand (meaning you don't have to mine a genesis block for it to pass minimal pow).\r\n\r\nThis allows the daemon to create a new regtest-like chains on demand.\r\nThe hash of the genesis block is dependent on the \"petname\" of the chain.\r\nExamples: \"regtest2, custom, chain_2, aaa, bbbb\"\r\n\r\nThe hash of the genesis block could depend on more things.\r\nFor example, for signet chains, it could depend on the signet_blockscript in the case of BIP325 (signet) https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16411/\r\n\r\nIn fact, #16411 could be simplified if this was merged first, for the genesis block wouldn't need to be mined anymore (which requires a special case in grindblock which in turn requires CreateSignetGenesisBlock to be exposed in chainparams). So I guess perhaps signet could be counted as a use case, or perhaps only part of this.\r\n\r\nBut why would somebody want more than one regtest?\r\n\r\nI'm personally using it for doing cross-chain payments in lightning, see https://github.com/jtimon/multi-ln-demo/blob/master/conf/bitcoind.conf\r\nI would like to work on what I call \"cross chain trampoline payments\" and I plan to keep using it for that too.\r\n\r\nI imagine other developers could find this useful for other developments involving bitcoin-like chains.\r\nFor example atomic swaps or submarine swaps.\r\n\r\nOf course, an alternative for these use cases is to use other regtests from other bitcoin-like networks, for example litecoin regtest or liquid regtest.\r\n\r\nAnother use case is creating temporal testnets for testing upcoming features.\r\nFor example, had this been in place before segwit, when \"segwitnet\" (was that its name) was created, it could have simply been some shared configuration instead of an additional hardoced chainparams.\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[segwitnet]\r\nsegwitheight=0\r\nrpcport=18555\r\nport=18556\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're not going to use it for a segwitnet now, obviously, but perhaps for a taprootnet or something.\r\nPerhaps #17032 would be needed too for this use case in particular to be more useful though, or at least make that for some of the fields that are different between testnet3 and regtest.\r\n",

(file left for later, see https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/tree/b16-new-testnet-file )\r\n- [X] New chains are neither orange, blue nor green: they're purple and have your custom chain petname shown in the GUI.\r\n- Extra context: some people asked for signed blocks but that's way more disruptive and this is already review-thirsty (see #9177 ).\r\n  ",

          "body": "This PR implements BIP 325 (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0325.mediawiki) -- Signet support.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This PR is being split into more bite-sized PR's, the first of which is #18267.\r\n\r\nMerged check boxes:\r\n* [ ] Signet consensus: #18267\r\n* [ ] Signet RPC tools: pending consensus merge\r\n* [ ] Signet utility scripts (contrib/signet): pending RPC tool merge\r\n\r\nSignet is a proposed new type of test network that requires a signature in the blocks. While this kind of network is centralized, it allows for properties that are desirable in a test network, which testnet alone cannot provide.\r\n\r\nSignet has a default global testnet baked in for easy usage, but is built around the concept of there being multiple simultaneous signets. Someone is already working on a signet with bip-taproot etc patched on top of it. When new features are tested globally, starting a temporary signet for that purpose is trivial.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Signet\r\n\r\nNoteworthy:\r\n* ~~proof of work check now skips genesis block for all networks, including mainnet~~\r\n* a new global \"is signet\" flag is added, which affects consensus: it adds a new enforcement that all blocks must have a valid signature for the \"signet block script\", a global script\r\n* `DecodeHexBlk` will now attempt to load the block data from a file whose filename is the hex string argument, if it turns out to not be a valid hex string; this has the odd caveat of the relative directory being relative to the execution of `bitcoind`, not `bitcoin-cli` (see `contrib/signet/mkblock.sh`)\r\n\r\nUpdate: proof of work check is back in place; instead, Signet now requires an additional `-signet_genesisnonce` parameter to operate.",

          "body": "When trying to pay an invoice from another network, I get the error message 'Could not find a route' (code 205).\r\nThat's not bad, it has to fail trying to find a route indeed.\r\nBut I think it would be nicer if it returned an error explicitly pointing out that the invoice to pay doesn't correspond with the network/chain this node is operating with.\r\n\r\nThe code I have doesn't seem to be working though, so any advice on this is very welcomed, assuming of course the concept makes sense in the first place.\r\n\r\nI'm testing this with https://github.com/jtimon/multi-ln-demo/pull/4 \r\nThis is where I check the error: https://github.com/jtimon/multi-ln-demo/blob/master/multiln/bin/demo.py#L114\r\n\r\nI don't expect people to run that, but I'm basically using the method pay() from contrib/pylightning.\r\nI'm confused because pay seems to be a plugin and not have the normal cmd argument with which to call get_chainparams().\r\n\r\nAgain, any tips welcomed.",

          "body": "This adds 5 new regtest-like chains to chainparams.\r\n\r\nThis could be useful for testing any experimental use case involving lightning and several chains/networks.\r\nFor example, I think it could be useful to more conveniently test multi-chain use cases related to https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/3260\r\n\r\nThis depends on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17037 , so I completely understand if this is not wanted because of that, or not wanted unless that gets merged or until that happens if it ever happens. For the alleged \"convenience\" is nullified if it's not compatible with bitcoin core releases, which is an inconvenience.\r\nI can close or re-open as asked.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt can also be a different number other than 5 chains (6 including regular regtest), of course.\r\nI guess the right number of regtest chains depend on the test cases.\r\n\r\nI will try to describe one, please don't judge the PR only by the example only (nor viceversa).\r\n\r\nIf I understood #3260 correctly, which I probably didn't at my first try, my most wanted test case looks something like this:\r\n\r\nAlice --chain_1_ln--> (TBCH1(Bob) -- htlc_accepted[hook] -->plugin(Bob) --sendonion[rpc]--> TBCH2(Bob)) --chain_2_ln-->  Carol\r\n\r\nWe could classify this test case as in the \"trampoline cross-chain payments\" class.\r\nAnd let's also define bob as acting as a \"trampoline cross-chain hop\" in this payment.\r\n\r\nA simplified notation could be:\r\n\r\nA1 -> B1_2 -> C2\r\n\r\nFor this same use case to need 5 chains, we would need something like\r\n\r\nA1 -> B1_2 -> C2_3 -> D3_4 -> E4_5 -> F5\r\n\r\n3 chains:\r\n\r\nA1 -> B1_2 -> C2_3 -> D3\r\n\r\n3 chains already means 2 cross-chain trampoline hops, so it should be plenty to demonstrate the use case, right?\r\nBeing trampoline payments, there could be any number of hops within the same chain.\r\n\r\nSo why 5?\r\nI got tired of searching names that corresponded to the alphabetical symbol:\r\n\r\nAlice -> Bob -> Carol -> David -> Ezra -> Fiona\r\n\r\nShamelessly pinging @cdecker @bitonic-cjp and @t-bast because I think they can all answer more questions about my own example than myself.\r\nAnd probably already thought of this very example, and better names for it than \"trampoline cross-chain payments\".\r\nI just want to see it happen, and hopefully help making it happen.\r\n\r\nSorry, I hop the example test case explanation wasn't too long.\r\n\r\nI tried to explain the same example with other words and without knowing about #3260 in https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-November/002354.html\r\n\r\nBut, sorry again, one thing is the example, another one this simple PR.\r\n",

I don't think this would be detrimental to signet, though.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, I would love to remove the grind genesis proof of work part from signet, but unfortunately this was discussed and people didn't like it so it was scratched (hence `-signet_genesisnonce`. I don't know if people will have a different opinion for this PR, but maybe with more feedback, we get a more complete picture on the topic.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm pretty much neutral.",

          "body": "This PR is to support functional tests by allowing the scheduler to be mocked via the RPC. \r\n\r\nIt adds a `MockForward` method to the scheduler class that iterates through the task queue and reschedules them to be `delta_seconds` sooner. \r\n\r\nThis is currently used to support functional testing of the \"unbroadcast\" set tracking in #18038. If this patch is accepted, it would also be useful to simplify the code in #16698.",

Go to menu _\"File\"_ -> _\"Open Wallet\"_, wallet will crash immediately\r\n\r\nIt's fixed by adding \"ec\" parameter into fs::exists() function to handle any error correctly.\r\n\r\n**Infinite loop:**\r\nIf iterator is not able to increment because of access denied to next level of recursive scan it will stay on the same position indefinitely causing wallet to stop responding.\r\n\r\nReproduction steps on Windows platform:\r\n1. Create new folder into bitcoin data folder (for example: _%Appdata%\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\\Loop_)\r\n2. Deny access to newly created folder for current user\r\n3. Run _bitcoin-qt.exe_\r\n4.

          "body": "This PR adds initial support for type hints checking in python scripts. \r\n\r\nSupport for type hints was introduced in Python 3.5. Type hints make it easier to read and review code in my opinion. Also an IDE may discover a potential bug sooner. Yet, as PEP 484 says: \"It should also be emphasized that Python will remain a dynamically typed language, and the authors have no desire to ever make type hints mandatory, even by convention.\" \r\n\r\n[Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is used in `lint-python.sh` to do the type checking. The package is standard so there is little chance that it will be abandoned. Mypy checks that type hints in source code are correct when they are not, it fails with an error.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\n* [--ignore-missing-imports](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-ignore-missing-imports) switch is passed on to `mypy` checker for now. The effect of this is that one does not need `# type: ignore` for `import zmq`. More information about import processing can be found [here](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports). This can be changed in a follow-up PR, if it is deemed useful. \r\n* We are stuck with Python 3.5 until 04/2021 (see https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/python3). When Python version is bumped to 3.6+, one can change:\r\n    ```python\r\n    _opcode_instances = []  # type: List[CScriptOp]\r\n    ```\r\n    to \r\n    ```python\r\n    _opcode_instances:List[CScriptOp] = [] \r\n    ```\r\n    for type hints that are **not** function parameters and function return types.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Useful resources:**\r\n\r\n* https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/typing.html\r\n* https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/",

If the params are passed along with a node context, those could be removed, as just passing a node context should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nI suggest that existing code stays as is, but whenever code is touched for other reasons, it could be updated to use `EnsureParams()`.",
