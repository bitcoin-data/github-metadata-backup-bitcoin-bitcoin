    "body": "And bip70 name.\r\nAnd on demand (meaning you don't have to mine a genesis block for it to pass minimal pow).\r\n\r\nThis allows the daemon to create a new regtest-like chains on demand.\r\nThe hash of the genesis block is dependent on the \"petname\" of the chain.\r\nExamples: \"regtest2, custom, chain_2, aaa, bbbb\"\r\n\r\nThe hash of the genesis block could depend on more things.\r\nFor example, for signet chains, it could depend on the signet_blockscript in the case of BIP325 (signet) https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16411/\r\n\r\nIn fact, #16411 could be simplified if this was merged first, for the genesis block wouldn't need to be mined anymore (which requires a special case in grindblock which in turn requires CreateSignetGenesisBlock to be exposed in chainparams). So I guess perhaps signet could be counted as a use case, or perhaps only part of this.\r\n\r\nBut why would somebody want more than one regtest?\r\n\r\nI'm personally using it for doing cross-chain payments in lightning, see https://github.com/jtimon/multi-ln-demo/blob/master/conf/bitcoind.conf\r\nI would like to work on what I call \"cross chain trampoline payments\" and I plan to keep using it for that too.\r\n\r\nI imagine other developers could find this useful for other developments involving bitcoin-like chains.\r\nFor example atomic swaps or submarine swaps.\r\n\r\nOf course, an alternative for these use cases is to use other regtests from other bitcoin-like networks, for example litecoin regtest or liquid regtest.\r\n\r\nAnother use case is creating temporal testnets for testing upcoming features.\r\nFor example, had this been in place before segwit, when \"segwitnet\" (was that its name) was created, it could have simply been some shared configuration instead of an additional hardoced chainparams.\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[segwitnet]\r\nsegwitheight=0\r\nrpcport=18555\r\nport=18556\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're not going to use it for a segwitnet now, obviously, but perhaps for a taprootnet or something.\r\nPerhaps #17032 would be needed too for this use case in particular to be more useful though, or at least make that for some of the fields that are different between testnet3 and regtest.\r\n",
