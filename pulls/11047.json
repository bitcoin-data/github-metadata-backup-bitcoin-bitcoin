    "body": "This may be a non-starter because of the churn caused, but I thought I'd put it out there and see what people think. Not that git is usually smart enough to figure out filename only changes, so rebasing shouldn't be an issue.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the functional tests to have a consistent naming scheme:\r\n\r\n- tests for individual RPC methods are named `rpc_...`\r\n- tests for interfaces (REST, ZMQ, RPC features) are named `interface_...`\r\n- tests that explicitly test the p2p interface are named `p2p_...`\r\n- tests for wallet features are named `wallet_...`\r\n- tests for mining features are named `mining_...`\r\n- tests for mempool behaviour are named `mempool_...`\r\n- tests for full features that aren't wallet/mining/mempool are named `feature_...`\r\n\r\nRationale: it's sometimes difficult for new contributors to know what's already covered by existing tests and where new tests should be added. Naming in a consistent fashion makes it easier to see what's already covered at a glance.",
