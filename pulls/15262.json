      "body": "NAK.   As far as I know, C++14 is not very interesting (C++17 OTOH...) and it is still incompatible with the latest releases of widely used supported GNU/Linux distros as pointed out on #13356.\r\n\r\nMoving the minimum required language requires balancing the negative trade-offs of incompatibility with the positive benefits of the new language features.   I'm not aware of any C++14 features that would obviously improve the codebase.   If there weren't a compatibility issue then sure why not, or if there were some really important language features that would make the software safer then it might be worth the cost (as C++11 was worth some incompatibility, though it was worse than we anticipated).\r\n",
