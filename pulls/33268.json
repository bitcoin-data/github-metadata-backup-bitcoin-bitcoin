    "body": "One of the ways that the wallet would determine if a transaction was sent from the wallet was by checking if the total amount being spent by a transaction from outputs known to the wallet was greater than 0. This has worked fine until recently since there was no reason for 0-value outputs to be created. However, with ephemeral dust and P2A, it is possible to create standard 0-value outputs, and the wallet was not correctly identifying the spends of such outputs. This PR updates `IsFromMe` to only check whether the wallet knows any of the inputs, rather than checking the debit amount of a transaction.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a new functional test is added to test for this case, as well as a few other anchor output related scenarios. This also revealed a bug in `sendall` which would cause an assertion error when trying to spend all of the outputs in a wallet that has anchor outputs.\r\n\r\nFixes #33265 ",
