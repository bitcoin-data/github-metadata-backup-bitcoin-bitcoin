A couple of commits have been extended to include shield-related code.\r\n\r\nList of upstream PRs backported/adapted:\r\n\r\n- bitcoin#9906  : Disallow copy constructor CReserveKeys\r\n- bitcoin#9830  : Add safe flag to listunspent result\r\n- bitcoin#9993  : Initialize nRelockTime\r\n- bitcoin#10108 : ApproximateBestSubset should take inputs by reference, not value\r\n- bitcoin#10075 : Remove unused C++ code not covered by unit tests\r\n- bitcoin#10257 : Add test for getmemoryinfo\r\n- bitcoin#10295 : Move some WalletModel functions into CWallet\r\n- bitcoin#10500 : Avoid CWalletTx copies in GetAddressBalances and GetAddressGroupings\r\n- bitcoin#10522 : Remove unused variables\r\n- bitcoin#10816 : Properly forbid -salvagewallet and -zapwallettxes for multi wallet\r\n- bitcoin#10849 : Multiwallet: simplest endpoint support\r\n- bitcoin#9380  : Separate different uses of minimum fees (only dustRelayFee)\r\n- bitcoin#10817 : Redefine Dust and add a discard_rate (only first commit)\r\n- bitcoin#10883 : Rename -usewallet to -rpcwallet\r\n- bitcoin#10604 : Add listwallets RPC, include wallet name in getwalletinfo + tests\r\n- bitcoin#10893 : Avoid running multiwallet.py twice\r\n- bitcoin#10870 : Use wallet 0 in rpc console if running with multiple wallets\r\n- bitcoin#10931 : Fix misleading \"method not found\" multiwallet errors\r\n- bitcoin#10885 : Reject invalid wallets\r\n- bitcoin#11022 : Basic keypool topup\r\n- bitcoin#10976 : [MOVEONLY] Move some static functions out of wallet.h/cpp\r\n- bitcoin#11310 : Test listwallets RPC\r\n- bitcoin#10858 : \"errors\" to getblockchaininfo + unify \"errors\" field in get*info RPCs\r\n- bitcoin#11492 : Fix leak in CDB constructor\r\n- bitcoin#11476 : Avoid opening copied wallet databases simultaneously\r\n- bitcoin#11590 : always show help-line of wallet encryption calls\r\n- bitcoin#11289 : Add wallet backup text to import* and add* RPCs",
