    "body": "The current block download timeout logic uses the number of blocks in flight (with validated headers) to extend the time we give a peer to deliver a block before disconnecting; the idea is that we permit extra time if there are many blocks in flight, because we may be saturating our own network link.\n\nHowever, this means that if there are many blocks in flight when a block request goes out, then a peer may be able to stall for a very long time on such a block request before we disconnect and request the block elsewhere.  In particular, during initial block download, we might have 128 blocks in flight at a time, meaning that the block download timeout may not trigger even if a peer doesn't deliver a block for over 10 hours.  This would be the case even if the other 127 blocks requested before a given block were all delivered very quickly.\n\nWith this commit, we ratchet down the block download window if the same block request made now (with the current time and current number of blocks in flight) would result in an earlier timeout than the one calculated when the block request originally went out.  As we approach the end of a large block download, if a handful of peers have a handful of blocks still outstanding, the download window given to each peer before we disconnect will be substantially reduced as the number of blocks in flight is reduced.\n\nNote that in all circumstances, a peer will have at least 20 minutes to deliver a block before we'd disconnect.  Whenever this code reduces the timeout, it is reducing it to a time in the future that is at least 20 minutes from now.\n\n(This was motivated by #5662, which in its current form would allow inbound peers to serve blocks and result in potentially even more blocks in flight.)\n",

With this change, in that same situation, the peer would have to deliver the first block in 20 minutes or be disconnected, which seems like a meaningful improvement.\n",
