    "body": "The current block download timeout logic uses the number of blocks in flight (with validated headers) to extend the time we give a peer to deliver a block before disconnecting; the idea is that we permit extra time if there are many blocks in flight, because we may be saturating our own network link.\n\nHowever, this means that if there are many blocks in flight when a block request goes out, then a peer may be able to stall for a very long time on such a block request before we disconnect and request the block elsewhere.  In particular, during initial block download, we might have 128 blocks in flight at a time, meaning that the block download timeout may not trigger even if a peer doesn't deliver a block for over 10 hours.  This would be the case even if the other 127 blocks requested before a given block were all delivered very quickly.\n\nWith this commit, we ratchet down the block download window if the same block request made now (with the current time and current number of blocks in flight) would result in an earlier timeout than the one calculated when the block request originally went out.  As we approach the end of a large block download, if a handful of peers have a handful of blocks still outstanding, the download window given to each peer before we disconnect will be substantially reduced as the number of blocks in flight is reduced.\n\nNote that in all circumstances, a peer will have at least 20 minutes to deliver a block before we'd disconnect.  Whenever this code reduces the timeout, it is reducing it to a time in the future that is at least 20 minutes from now.\n\n(This was motivated by #5662, which in its current form would allow inbound peers to serve blocks and result in potentially even more blocks in flight.)\n",

          "body": "This fixes the download behavior to allow downloading blocks on a chain that is known only by inbound peers and not by outbound/preferred download peers, mentioned in issue #5138.\n\n@sipa  I tried implementing your suggestion (on IRC) of just guarding the getdata code block with a (preferredpeer || rand() %100 == 0).  I think this works for what we were discussing (where an inbound peer announces a tip more than 1 block ahead on a chain no one else knows about), but it doesn't resolve @gavinandresen's test case in issue #5138 because we still wouldn't be sending getheaders when an inbound peer connects like we do for outbound peers. Instead, we'd have to wait for an inv that builds on the longer chain from the inbound peer before we send getheaders, and then with this code send the getdata.\n\nOne question: is it necessary to also check `!pto->fOneShot()` with this change?  I didn't think it would be possible for us to have a one shot peer's headers and therefore no blocks we'd ever try to download, so I left it out, but perhaps it's preferable to include that check just to be safe...?\n\nAs an aside: I noticed that an additional way we could workaround the regtest issue @gavinandresen raised, besides connecting nodes to each other in both directions, would be to whitelist localhost.\n\nI've tested this code on a modified version of the test, where after connecting a node with a longer chain and observing that the tips didn't sync, I then generated one more block on that inbound peer and observed that the tips then did sync.\n\nFinally, I believe that if we wanted to send an initial getheaders message to all inbound peers just as we do for outbound peers so that we could immediately download a longer chain known only by an inbound peer, we could do so with a similar small change to the code that sends the initial getheaders messages (while still preferring outbound peers for downloading blocks during initial block download), but it wasn't clear to me whether such a behavior change would be desirable.\n",

      "body": "@sipa  I thought you raised a good point about ignoring blocks requested after a given one, so I've pushed up a commit that does so (for block requests going to the same peer).\n\nI am not entirely sure the additional 5 lines of code (and one extra piece of state for each peer) is worth the code complexity, so if you prefer the first version I can drop this commit, but it seemed unfortunate that in the first approach,  if a single peer had 16 blocks outstanding at the end of your download, that even the reduced timeout window would still be 95 minutes away -- a long time compared with how fast IBD should be with headers-first.  With this change, in that same situation, the peer would have to deliver the first block in 20 minutes or be disconnected, which seems like a meaningful improvement.\n",

          "body": "I've brought this previous pull request up to date and defined a new use case for it https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4687 .\n\n```\nThis option is useful for mining pools that want faster block propagation.\nOutbound connections will statistically have better overall network connectivity\nthan incoming connections. This is due to most nodes that accept these\noutbound connections supporting a maximum of 125 connections.\nInbound connections are often NAT restricted and will then only support 8\nconnections. These NAT restricted connections are less desirable for pools.\nThis can be demonstrated using the following example of a pool with 125 connections.\nThis example makes the assumption that inbound connections are NAT restricted and \nlimited to 8 connections while outbound connections connect to nodes with the\ndefault connection limit of 125.\nConnection capacity within one hop of pool with default settings:\n(8 outbound connections * 125 connections per node) +\n(117 incoming connections * 8 connections per node) =\n1936 Connections within one hop of the pool server\n(125 outbound connections * 125 connections per node) =\n15625 Connections within one hop of the pool server\nBased off of these calculations a pool server can have about 8 times the\noverall network connections within one hop while establishing\nthe same amount of connections itself. In reality it will likely be even more\ndue to the bitcoin network having far more available connections slots on nodes\nthan there are nodes trying to connect to those slots.\nThis setting should only be used by pool operators.\n```\n",
