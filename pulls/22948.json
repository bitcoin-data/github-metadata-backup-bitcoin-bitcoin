    "body": "Currently, at the end of a test vector (valid or invalid) we iterate the flags one by one and unset them and check that it makes the transaction succeed or fail. \r\n\r\nThis is called 'minimality' in that we want to check that each flag is sufficient on it's own. However, I think we should be instead doing the 2**(specified) combinations of flag, to ensure that for all combinations of flags only the one we have specified is either valid or invalid.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we might have e.g. subsets of flags that have interactions we're not detecting here.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the asymptotic runtime here should be better on average (since we don't usually set that many flags, v.s. 32 iterations on the one by one checker), but the worst case is 2**32 flag combos. It's up to the test writers to not abuse this check.\r\n\r\nContrived example demonstrating the problem:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconst auto sum = flag_a_set + flag_b_set +flag_c_set ;\r\n// check parity is even\r\nif (sum & 1) throw \"Oops\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nhaving set \"a,b,c\", the one-by-one checker for \"a,b,c,\" expects failure would check [\"a,b\", \"a,c\", \"b,c\"] and see no failures since the parity of each is 2. However, [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] would fail since the parity is 1. \r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any code that is written in this specific manner, but similar circumstance might arise naturally in the code.",

      "body": "If I understand the intent of this code correctly, the idea is that given a set of chosen flags, we want to check that every possible superset of flags doesn't succeed. If that's so, I believe there's a problem with the current `FlipAll( GenerateAllSubMasks( flags ) )` logic for computing all possible supersets.\r\n\r\nEg, assuming 3-bit words, for `flags = 100`, we'll generate all `flags` sub masks `{000}`, and then flip them `{111}`. However, what we really want is to generate all the `~flags = 011` sub masks `{010, 001, 000}`, and then flip them `{101, 110, 111}`.\r\n\r\nIn short, there's a missing bit flip before computing all the sub masks. Ie. it should be\r\n```\r\nFlipAll( GenerateAllSubMasks( ~flags ) )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that said, there's still the issue that flipping flag bits doesn't interact well with the `TrimFlags` operation done inside `GenerateAllSubMasks`.\r\n\r\nEg. if the only flag bits were`VERIFY_P2SH` and `VERIFY_WITNESS` (in that order), for `flags = 00` we'd generate all the `~flags = 11` sub masks `{10, 01, 00}`, trim them `{10, 00, 00}` (`01` is mapped to `00`), remove duplicates `{10, 00}`, and finally flip them `{01, 11}`. However, we ended up with an invalid combination (`01`) when the correct result would have been `{10, 11}`.\r\n\r\nMore generally, after fixing the initial missing flip, the code would look something like\r\n```\r\nFlipAll( Unique( TrimFlags( GenerateAllSubMasksWithoutTrimming( ~flags ) ) ) )\r\n```\r\nwhen what we really want is something like:\r\n```\r\nfor flag_superset in FlipAll( GenerateAllSubMasksWithoutTrimming( ~flags ) ) ) ):\r\n    if flag_superset == TrimFlags( flag_superset ):\r\n        # use flag_superset\r\n```",
