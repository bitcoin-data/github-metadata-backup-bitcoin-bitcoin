C++17 is optimistically planned for 0.21.0.**_\r\n\r\n* build: Update `ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.m4` to latest version which supports C++17 checking\r\n* build: Use C++17 mode when compiling. Require a compiler with support for C++17 language features.\r\n* ci: Add `-fsanitize=integer` suppression (`unsigned-integer-overflow`) for `libstdc++` C++17's `basic_string` (`rfind`)\r\n* Use `std::make_unique` (C++14) instead of legacy `MakeUnique` wrapper\r\n* Use `std::optional` (C++17) instead of `boost::optional`\r\n* Use `[[nodiscard]]` (C++17) instead of legacy `NODISCARD` macro\r\n\r\nLeft to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make AppVeyor compile using MSVC in C++17 mode.\r\n- [ ] Revert temporary commit \"Temporarily disable Travis build jobs without a C++17 compiler\" and apply proper fix instead\r\n- [ ] Revert temporary commit \"Temporarily disable `test_spanparsing`\" (`test_spanparsing` does not not compile in C++17 mode) and apply proper fix instead\r\n",
