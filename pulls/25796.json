    "body": "This PR implements an RPC called `descriptorprocesspsbt`. This RPC is based off of `walletprocesspsbt`, but instead of interacting with the wallet to update, sign and finalize a psbt, it instead accepts an array of output descriptors and uses that information along with information from the mempool, txindex, and the utxo set to do so. `utxoupdatepsbt` also updates a psbt in this manner, but doesn't sign or finalize it. Because of this overlap, a helper function that is added in this PR is called by both `utxoupdatepsbt` and `descriptorprocesspsbt`. Whether or not the helper function signs a psbt is dictated by if the HidingSigningProvider passed to it contains any private information. There is also a test added in this PR for this new RPC that uses p2wsh, p2wpkh, and legacy outputs. \r\nEdit: see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25796#issuecomment-1228830963",

          "title": "descriptors: Be able to specify change and receiving in a single descriptor string",
          "body": "It is convenient to have a descriptor which specifies both receiving and change addresses in a single string. However, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17190#issuecomment-895515768, it is not feasible to use a generic multipath specification like BIP 88 due to combinatorial blow up and that it would result in unexpected descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo resolve that problem, this PR proposes a targeted solution which allows only a single pair of 2 derivation indexes to be inserted in the place of a single derivation index. So instead of two descriptor `wpkh(xpub.../0/0/*)` and `wpkh(xpub.../0/1/*)` to represent receive and change addresses, this could be written as `wpkh(xpub.../0/<0;1>/*)`. The multipath specifier is of the form `<NUM;NUM>`. Each `NUM` can have its own hardened specifier, e.g. `<0;1h>` is valid. The multipath specifier can also only appear in one path index in the derivation path.\r\n\r\nThis results in the parser returning two descriptors. The first descriptor uses the first `NUM` in all pairs present, and the second uses the second `NUM`. In our implementation, if a multipath descriptor is not provided, a pair is still returned, but the second element is just `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nThe wallet will not output the multipath descriptors (yet). Furthermore, when a multipath descriptor is imported, it is expanded to the two descriptors and each imported on its own, with the second descriptor being implicitly for internal (change) addresses. There is no change to how the wallet stores or outputs descriptors (yet).\r\n\r\nNote that the path specifier is different from what was proposed. It uses angle brackets and the semicolon because these are unused characters available in the character set and I wanted to avoid conflicts with characters already in use in descriptors.\r\n\r\nCloses #17190 ",

          "title": "[Draft / POC] Silent Payments",
          "body": "This PR proposes an early version of [Silent Payment](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8) (author:@RubenSomsen).\r\nIn this scheme, the recipient generates a public address, but the sender tweaks the address and the recipient detects the payment by verifying all transactions on the blockchain. An example use case would be private donations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is not a final version, but to start the discussion and get benchmarks based on a real implementation.\r\n\r\nThis version is built on top of [#994](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/994) (bitcoin-core/secp256k1) for x-only ECDH support and #23480 (bitcoin/bitcoin) for `rawtr()`. Each new silent transaction detected is stored in wallet as a `rawtr()` descriptor. \r\n\r\nIn this implementation, the sender can tweak the recipient address by passing the `silent_payment` option to send RPC. The transaction output will be different from the address entered.\r\n\r\nFor example `./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named send outputs=\"[{\\\"bcrt1pwlh5xuyrpgfunwyww8cfu78yfs2yqyevl7yturavahh5kgxwdd2q5hzgfu\\\": 1.1}]\" fee_rate=1 options=\"{ \\\"silent_payment\\\": true}\"`.\r\n\r\nwill generate `vout` with completely unrelated outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"vout\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 1.10000000,\r\n      \"n\": 0,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(65b19890c5ca40edb816d26f5f48cd9f3ed51121613b1c2405adc1a6dbbc824a)#8myx9tcu\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pvkce3yx9efqwmwqk6fh47jxdnuld2yfpvya3cfq94hq6dkausf9qrfjkgz\",\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 2.02499835,\r\n      \"n\": 1,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(c45cb3d500bbf8f0c8841e8e011b008781d826c16ee348edb822c0f97419bc4d)#26hcce63\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pc3wt84gqh0u0pjyyr68qzxcqs7qasfkpdm353mdcytq0jaqeh3xsuvlykg\",\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny wallet, as long as it has access to private keys, can send silent payments. Thus, this excludes watch-only wallets or wallets with external signers .\r\n\r\nBut the recipient's wallet needs a new flag called `SILENT_PAYMENT`. This flag allows an additional scan that verifies that the wallet keys match the silent payment scheme. When it detects a silent payment that belongs to the wallet, it is stored in a `rawtr()` descriptor.\r\n\r\n`./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named createwallet wallet_name=\"recipient\" silent_payment=true`\r\n\r\nTherefore, scanning each address for each transaction is potentially prohibitive overhead, so the node can be initialized with `keypool=1` or a descriptor with range [0,1] can be imported into a blank wallet. Until there is more benchmark data, it is the safest option. The proposal recommends one static address.\r\n\r\nI've been running some silent payments on signet using wallets with default keypool and default range, I haven't noticed any relevant performance drops on the signet node.\r\nApparently this implementation is working as expected but I can't guarantee that the scheme is implemented correctly or safely, so I'm opening this PR for reviews, modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nThere is a new functional test (`test/functional/wallet_silentpayment.py`) that can help to better understand the implementation.",

Before this RPC looked for just the utxos in the utxo set and the mempool. This PR makes it so that if the user has txindex enabled, then the full transaction is looked for there for all inputs. If it is not found in the txindex or  txindex isn't enabled, then the mempool is checked for the full transaction. If the transaction an input is spending from is still not found at that point, then the utxo set is searched and the inputs spending segwit outputs are updated with just the utxo.",

It's been a few minutes of staring and I'm not quite sure what's exactly being tested here, making it difficult to update in the future.\r\n\r\nMy basic test flow would probably follow the lines of:\r\n\r\n1) pick a node that doesn't have a wallet\r\n2) make a single wpkh utxo\r\n3) make single input psbt with that utxo\r\n4) make sure it signs it when expected, and finalizes when expected (e.g., give it a descriptor unrelated to the utxo, partial_signature lying around when expected, vary sighash modes)\r\n5) make sure extracted tx submits to mempool ok\r\n\r\nimo we don't need to re-test all of the descriptor logic that's internal and hopefully already tested; we just want to check that the API here makes sense and pipes through. The 2-of-3 multisig, multi-input stuff just seems like a distraction.",
