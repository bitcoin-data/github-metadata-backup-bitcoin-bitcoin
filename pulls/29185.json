Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code.

For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs.

Is the recommended way to manually override CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS now?\r\n\r\nYea. `-flto` is really no different to `-O2` or any other compile option, so using it will require adding `-flto=*`, and any other related options you might want, i.e using a link cache via `-Wl,-cache_path_lto`, to the respective *FLAGS vars. Note that this is already required by anyone wanting to do anything other, or in addion to just using `-flto` with the current options (or they'd have to workaround by modifying the source etc).",

So I guess it would have to be appended to `CXX` and possibly `LDFLAGS`.\r\n\r\nAppending to `CXXFLAGS` works fine.\r\n\r\nFWIW, there are three `if test \"$CXXFLAGS_overridden\" = \"no\"` cases in the `configure.ac`, which also includes processing of the warning options (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25972).\r\n\r\nUPD.\r\n```\r\n$ ./configure CC=clang-15 CXX=clang++-15 CXXFLAGS=\"-g -O2 -flto=thin\" SECP_CFLAGS=\"-flto=thin\"\r\n$ make -C src bitcoind\r\n```",
