For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs.

Is the recommended way to manually override CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS now?\r\n\r\nYea. `-flto` is really no different to `-O2` or any other compile option, so using it will require adding `-flto=*`, and any other related options you might want, i.e using a link cache via `-Wl,-cache_path_lto`, to the respective *FLAGS vars. Note that this is already required by anyone wanting to do anything other, or in addion to just using `-flto` with the current options (or they'd have to workaround by modifying the source etc).",

The reviewing process is happening in this [repo](https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin) as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27060#issuecomment-1431798320.\r\n3. The recent discussion at CoreDev -- https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-09/cmake/\r\n\r\nHow reviewing happens:\r\n1. Pull requests are opened against the https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/tree/cmake-staging branch.\r\n2. After reviewing and merging them, the staging branch get synced with the main branch from this repo.\r\n4. This loop continues until all commits from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797 get reviewed.\r\n\r\nThe planned chunks of work:\r\n- [x] The root `CMakeLists.txt` and `config/bitcoin-config.h` files -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/5\r\n- [x] Project-wide system introspections; the `leveldb` build target -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/6\r\n- [x] The `bitcoind` build target -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/7\r\n- [x] Cross-compiling support -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/10\r\n- [x] Ccache support; `libnatpmp`, `libminiupnpc`, `libzmq` and `systemtap-sdt` optional packages support -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/13\r\n- [x] Utility binaries, wallet functionality, `bench_bitcoin` and `test_bitcoin` -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/15\r\n- [x] Handling different build configurations -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/18\r\n- [x] Hardening, shared libraries -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/32\r\n- ~Build `libbitcoinconsensus` library -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/41~ See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29189\r\n- [ ] Qt stuff\r\n- [ ] Guix builds -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/67\r\n- [ ] Building for fuzzing -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/43\r\n- [ ] Building for Android\r\n- [ ] CI stuff\r\n- [ ] `libbitcoin-kernel` and `bitcoin-chainstate`\r\n- [ ] multiprocess support\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n~The current minimum required CMake version is 3.13, which is the system [package](https://packages.debian.org/buster/cmake) on [Debian 10](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/). Considering the timings of Debian 10 LTS EOL and integrating CMake into this repo, it seems reasonable to bump the minimum supported version up to 3.16, which is the system [package](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/cmake) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.~\r\n\r\n- [x] Bump minimum supported CMake version from 3.13 up to 3.16 -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/33\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo hold the 100% feature parity, the current CMake-based build system implementation can autodetect an optional package and enable it as Autotools-based one does. However, it was suggested to make all optional package opt-in by default. See:\r\n- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/12#discussion_r1156251913\r\n- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/12#discussion_r1157570678\r\n- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/13#discussion_r1164377093\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make all optional package opt-in by default\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAutotools -- CMake Feature Parity Table is available [here](https://gist.github.com/hebasto/2ef97d3a726bfce08ded9df07f7dab5e).\r\n\r\nTo list CMake's options, one might add the `-LH` option during configuring step.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdated build docs:\r\n- [Building Bitcoin Core with Visual Studio](https://gist.github.com/hebasto/32c77c0cd592d13685437271ac6b79f6)",
