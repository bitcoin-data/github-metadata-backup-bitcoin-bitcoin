    "body": "This is a substantial improvement of fee estimation code built off #9942.\r\nAlthough in many cases the estimates will not appear to differ by much from previous estimates, they will handle some situations much better.\r\n\r\nA longer writeup of the original algorithm and the changes in this PR can be found here:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/morcos/d3637f015bc4e607e1fd10d8351e9f41\r\n\r\nA summary of major changes:\r\n- Estimates can now be given for up to a 1008 block target.\r\n- Estimates are tracked on 3 different time horizons which allows for both the longer targets and lets the estimates adjust more quickly to changes in conditions.\r\n- estimatefee is deprecated in favor of using only estimatesmartfee (already used by the GUI)\r\n- estimateSmartFee now requires a 60% success rate at target/2, an 85% rate at target and a 95% rate at 2*target.\r\n- estimates are by default conservative which requires the 95% rate for 2*target to be met at longer time horizons as well, but by choosing non-conservative estimates, the estimates are drastically reduced during periods of less transaction activity (such as the weekend).\r\n- estimates are smarter about making sure enough data has been gathered in order to return a valid estimate (at least twice the number of blocks as the requested target much have been recorded)\r\n- Fee rate buckets are half as big leading to a bit more precision.\r\n- estimaterawfee is added so that customized logic can be implemented to analyze the raw data and calculate estimates.\r\n- Transactions which leave the mempool due to eviction or other non-confirmed reasons now count as failures.  These are also saved at shutdown.\r\n\r\n**A summary of open issues:**\r\n- Estimates are not backwards compatible.  Currently when updating to this patch, any old fee estimates will be discarded and your node will have to be running for a while to provide new estimates.  It is a possibility to add logic to return the old estimates for targets 2-25 until the new estimates have gathered enough data.\r\n- estimatefee is probably a roughly similar calculation to what it used to be, but I've made no effort to make sure the quality of the estimates it gives have not degraded, so infrastructure which doesn't support estimatesmartfee should update.\r\n- The GUI needs to be updated to access the new range of estimates.  I would suggest providing options for targets of: 2,4,6,12,24,48,144,504,1008\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks @jonasschnelli.  In Berlin, I noted that at least 50% of the wallets listed on bitcoin.org use Core as a fee estimation source directly or through other servers based on Core and any statistical or algorithmic biases might compound over time because of the large number of clients using the single source.   I presented some anecdotal, non-scientific observations about fees and some reasons that they might be artificially high.  Some of my concerns about the current esitmatefee were\r\n\r\n* Slow to respond (2.5 day half life)\r\n* Too high confidence (95%)\r\n* No long term estimates (only 25 blocks)\r\n\r\nI believe that the changes in this PR mitigate some of those concerns, and thus I am in favor of these changes.  Nice work!  \r\n\r\nI'm still a little concerned about so many wallets \"competing\" using the same identical algorithm.  @morcos do you envision some devs (wallets) would use estimaterawfee to tweak the algorithm for their users?",

The exact strategy you use for determining what fee you want to put on a transaction depends on so many factors that its hard to have a one size fits all solution, but thats exactly what Bitcoin Core has to try to ship.  So rather than attempt to defend why the algorithm I picked is the one algorithm to rule them all, I thought it would also make sense to expose a way to examine all the collected data and let people build their own algorithms if they'd like to.\r\n  ",

Was kind of annoying to squash, so will leave it if that's ok?\r\n\r\n@laanwj I think this is reviewed enough that we'd be better off merging and getting some more experimentation with the estimates..    It takes 2 full weeks for the longest estimates to even be exposed.  \r\n\r\nThe biggest open questions are whether I should add an ability to use old estimates during transition and whether we are going to build in GUI support.\r\n\r\nThe tests could also use some improvement but I don't think they're notably worse than they were.",

      "body": "After offline discussion, it appears the bigger issue is what to do when the short time horizon estimates have decayed to not being able to give you an answer.  It seems like what happens in conservative mode is probably the right thing where you take advantage of the fact that the longer time horizon estimates have not decayed yet.  We probably want the ability to utilize this as a fall back in non-conservative mode as well.  This can happen either from shutting down a node for a couple of days which means the short time horizon will decay too much, or even just from losing network activity from something like a laptop over the weekend.\r\nAs it is, I think its probably still a strict improvement to existing estimates, but could use further refinement.",

      "body": "The design of estimateSmartFee is to be used by the wallet to intelligently as possible automatically put a fee on a transaction being sent.  In the GUI, the slider clearly indicates what target the fee is being returned for.  For the RPC call estimatesmartfee, this is also clearly returned.  The difficulty comes with automatic estimation that happens from a sendtoaddress or sendmany RPC call.  If in the future we add a way to select a transaction confirm target with the desired RPC call, perhaps it would make sense to fail, but for now it seems to me that its more important for the transaction to go out, even if its paying a fee for a much faster target.",
