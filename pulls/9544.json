Consistency in order to improve readability and allow for automatic identification of missing/incorrect end of namespace comments.\r\n\r\n`// namespace` is the form preferred by the clang-tooling (`clang-tidy`, etc). `// anonymous namespace` is also quite common. I haven't seen `// anon namespace` before, but let me know if the choice of `// anon namespace` is intentional and I'll adjust this PR :-)",
