That is why simply matching on `\"%c\"` or `\"%*\"` is not enough. Note that the intentionally trivial skipping logic overshoots somewhat (`c[因%` is filtered in addition to `%[因c`).",

      "body": "@theStack Thanks for the review! I'll address the nit about `.find(char)`. The skipping logic is intentional - I wanted to keep it as simple as possible and the overshoot (that `c[因%` is matched in addition to `%[因c`) doesn't matter in practice. I'm happy to change that if proven wrong or if anyone cares strongly :)  Regardless I'll update the PR description to make the intention more clear. Again, thanks for reviewing!",

Given that if I understood your intention correctly ;-)\r\nAlso, a tiny nit: could use the overloaded version of `.find()` which takes a `char` as first parameter instead of passing strings with length 1, see http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/find/ (probably more efficient).",
