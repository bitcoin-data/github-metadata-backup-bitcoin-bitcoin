    "body": "This addition adds a build-time option that's linux specific.\n\nIt drops any capabilities assigned to the process at launch time (if it were launched as root, root loses all special meaning). It also removes all capabilities from the binding set and locks all options related to privilege escalation so that they may not be changed.\n\nFor these options to work (if built) the binary must be setuid root (horrible) or setcap cap_setpcap+eip bitcoind; (awesome) It only needs this capability so that it can clear the bounding set which it does in main() of bitcoind very first thing. I am not sure where the code needs to go to make it function in bitcoin gui client?\n\nFor more details make sure you have libcap2-dev installed and:\nman 7 capabilities\nman 2 prctl\n\nThe relevant sections of prctl(2) are: PR_CAPBSET_DROP and PR_SET_SECUREBITS.\n\nThis patch will make it so that (barring issues in the posix.1e implementation in the kernel itself) any code execution vulnerabilities in the future will be unable to gain escalated privileges through the bitcoind process. Even by exec()'ing suid binaries and exploiting known issues with them.\n\nForum thread:\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=7582.0\n",

For instance: (off the top of my head) bind uses it. The entirety of the priv escalation code in the kernel (setuid binary processing, etc) uses it. The bounding set feature that lets you set a mask of capabilities that can be re-enabled is fairly new but the underlying mechanisms have been in place since 2.4 iirc.\n\nAnd to answer you sgimenez this code isn't just removing all capabilities. It's setting the _capabilities bounding set_ so that _nothing spawned from the bitcoin process can ever re-enable them_. See the referenced documentation in the original pull.\n",
