    "body": "This makes Windows signing match the current OSX signing process.\n\n[osslsigncode](https://sourceforge.net/projects/osslsigncode/) has been patched to detach and re-attach Windows signatures. The changes can be seen here: https://github.com/theuni/osslsigncode/commits/attach-signature\n\nThere's a pull-request open upstream for the changes:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/osslsigncode/osslsigncode/merge-requests/3/\n\nThis work has been back-ported to the stable 1.7.1 release of osslsigncode, so that a smaller patch can be reviewed. Hopefully we'll get the changes merged upstream for the next release so that we can drop the patches here.\n\nFor reference, I've pushed the detached sigs that would've been used for 0.11.0rc2 here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin-detached-sigs/commit/329d2e8f0af8d71300c75c007fe4f384b4df12b1\n\nFor a test, I created a phony tag in my local bitcoin-detached-sigs repository and re-attached the 0.11.0rc2 .exe's from the detached sigs here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin-detached-sigs/commit/329d2e8f0af8d71300c75c007fe4f384b4df12b1. No surprise, they matched our release binaries.\n\nIf desired, this should be safe to use for 0.11.0-rc3.\n",

It's just a typical ./configure && make.
