    "body": "Functional test framework unit tests are currently run prior to all other functional tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables execution of the test framework unit tests in parallel with the functional tests, rather than before the functional tests, saving runtime and more efficiently using available cores.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29470#issuecomment-1962313977\r\n\r\n### New behavior:\r\n1) When running all tests, the framework unit tests are run in parallel with the other tests (unless explicitly skipped with `--exclude`).  This parallelization introduces marginal time savings when running all tests, depending on the machine used.  As an example, a 2-3% time savings (9 seconds) was observed on a machine using `--jobs=18` (with 18 available cores).\r\n2) When running specific functional tests, framework unit tests are now skipped by default.  Framework unit tests can be added by including `feature_framework_unit_tests.py` in the list of specific tests being executed.  The rationale for skipping by default is that if the tester is running specific functional tests, there is a conscious decision to focus testing, and choosing to run all tests (where unit tests are run by default) would be a next step.\r\n3) The `--skipunit` option is now removed since unit tests are parallelized (they no longer delay other tests).  Unit tests are treated equally as functional tests.\r\n\r\n### Implementation notes:\r\nSince `TextTestRunner` can be noisy (even with verbosity=0, and therefore trigger job failure through the presence of non-failure stderr output), the approach taken was to send output to stdout, and forward test result (as determined by `TestResult` returned).  This aligns with the previous check for unit test failure (`if not result.wasSuccessful():`).  \r\n\r\nThis approach was tested by inserting `self.assertEquals(True, False)` into test_framework/address.py and seeing specifics of the failure reported.\r\n\r\n```\r\n135/302 - feature_framework_unit_tests.py failed, Duration: 0 s\r\n\r\nstdout:\r\n.F\r\n======================================================================\r\nFAIL: test_bech32_decode (test_framework.address.TestFrameworkScript.test_bech32_decode)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/dev/myrepos/bitcoin/test/functional/test_framework/address.py\", line 228, in test_bech32_decode\r\n    self.assertEqual(True, False)\r\nAssertionError: True != False\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRan 2 tests in 0.003s\r\n\r\nFAILED (failures=1)\r\n\r\n\r\nstderr:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere was an initial thought to parallelize the execution of the unit tests themselves (i.e. run the 12 unit test files in parallel), however, this is not anticipated to further reduce runtime meaningfully and is anticipated to add unnecessary complexity.\r\n",

This is due to the implementation currently enforcing a direct single-byte data push (using `CScriptOp.encode_op_n`), which obviously fails for values 17+. Fix that by passing the numbers directly to the CScript list, where it's automatically converted to minimally-encoded pushes (see class method `CScript.__coerce_instance`, branch `isinstance(other, int)`). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second commit adds a unit test to ensure that the encoding  is correct.",

As you mentioned, the unit tests are decently fast and the default job value is 4 anyway (so there would be some inherent parallelization now rather than the previous behavior to serialize unit test execution).  For example, on my system, running `feature_signet.py` with or without `feature_framework_unit_tests.py` (default jobs=4) now has the same runtime.  The tests that would be impacted are relatively short ones anyway, and the user still has the option to specify `--skipunit` to save a few seconds (the difference between the short test execution and unit test runtime).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > When running specific functional tests, framework unit tests are now skipped by default\r\n> \r\n> This is useful, but wasn't that already the case? Or do you mean when using the `--filter` argument, rather than executing the individual test directly?\r\n\r\nThe previous behavior was to run the unit tests first, blocking all other tests until the unit tests passed.  If the unit tests failed, execution would stop before running any other tests (i.e. the default behavior for unit tests was to fail fast).\r\n\r\nThe new behavior is for unit tests to be run in parallel, not in a fail fast manner.  The user can specify `--failfast` to end testing early if any test fails (unit tests are no exception). \r\n\r\n",

Do you see this aligning with the original goals of `skipunit` or is there something else to consider? New behavior is described in the opening post, but briefly:\n- unit tests are run in parallel with other tests, so no longer delay other tests\n- unit tests are no longer run implicitly when running specific tests (so do not block those tests). Unit tests can be explicitly included in the list of tests.",

      "body": "Thank you for reviewing.  **Would you be ok with a simplified approach of writing all unit test output to stdout, with this output being shown when unit tests fail?**  This seems a bit cleaner and more consistent than selectively placing all unit test output to stdout or stderr depending on test pass/fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### More info\r\n`TextTestRunner` lets us print unit test output to one stream.  Previously (before this PR), `TextTestRunner` wrote all output to stderr regardless of pass/fail but doing this now would cause a false failure (test runner interprets any stderr to mean the test failed).\r\n\r\nAs was the case before this PR, unit test pass/fail would continue to be based on `TestResult` returned.\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned, stdout is hidden by the test runner in non-failure situations, so writing to stdout on test pass doesn't do much currently (other than providing the output to test runner for future use).  The user is provided with a reasonable test pass/fail status (matching that of the other tests).\r\n\r\n### Example output\r\n#### Pre-PR (pass)\r\n```\r\n$ test/functional/test_runner.py --jobs=18 --cachedir=/mnt/tmp/cache --tmpdir=/mnt/tmp test/functional/feature_signet.py\r\nTemporary test directory at /mnt/tmp/test_runner_₿_🏃_20240403_192403\r\nRunning Unit Tests for Test Framework Modules\r\n.....................\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRan 21 tests in 8.262s\r\n\r\nOK\r\nRemaining jobs: [feature_signet.py]\r\n1/1 - feature_signet.py passed, Duration: 8 s\r\n\r\nTEST              | STATUS    | DURATION\r\n\r\nfeature_signet.py | ✓ Passed  | 8 s\r\n\r\nALL               | ✓ Passed  | 8 s (accumulated) \r\nRuntime: 8 s\r\n```\r\n#### Pre-PR (failure in unit test)\r\n```\r\n$ test/functional/test_runner.py --jobs=18 --cachedir=/mnt/tmp/cache --tmpdir=/mnt/tmp test/functional/feature_signet.py\r\nTemporary test directory at /mnt/tmp/test_runner_₿_🏃_20240403_192509\r\nRunning Unit Tests for Test Framework Modules\r\n.F\r\n======================================================================\r\nFAIL: test_bech32_decode (test_framework.address.TestFrameworkScript.test_bech32_decode)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/dev/bitcoin/test/functional/test_framework/address.py\", line 228, in test_bech32_decode\r\n    self.assertEqual(False, True)\r\nAssertionError: False != True\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRan 2 tests in 0.003s\r\n\r\nFAILED (failures=1)\r\nEarly exiting after failure in TestFramework unit tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PR (pass, running unit and functional tests):\r\n```\r\n$ test/functional/test_runner.py --jobs=18 --cachedir=/mnt/tmp/cache --tmpdir=/mnt/tmp test/functional/feature_signet.py test/functional/feature_framework_unit_tests.py \r\nTemporary test directory at /mnt/tmp/test_runner_₿_🏃_20240403_193148\r\nRemaining jobs: [feature_signet.py, feature_framework_unit_tests.py]\r\n1/2 - feature_signet.py passed, Duration: 8 s\r\nRemaining jobs: [feature_framework_unit_tests.py]\r\n2/2 - feature_framework_unit_tests.py passed, Duration: 9 s\r\n\r\nTEST                            | STATUS    | DURATION\r\n\r\nfeature_framework_unit_tests.py | ✓ Passed  | 9 s\r\nfeature_signet.py               | ✓ Passed  | 8 s\r\n\r\nALL                             | ✓ Passed  | 17 s (accumulated) \r\nRuntime: 9 s\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR (pass, running only unit tests):\r\n```\r\n$ test/functional/test_runner.py --jobs=18 --cachedir=/mnt/tmp/cache --tmpdir=/mnt/tmp test/functional/feature_framework_unit_tests.py\r\nTemporary test directory at /mnt/tmp/test_runner_₿_🏃_20240403_193240\r\nRemaining jobs: [feature_framework_unit_tests.py]\r\n1/1 - feature_framework_unit_tests.py passed, Duration: 9 s\r\n\r\nTEST                            | STATUS    | DURATION\r\n\r\nfeature_framework_unit_tests.py | ✓ Passed  | 9 s\r\n\r\nALL                             | ✓ Passed  | 9 s (accumulated) \r\nRuntime: 9 s\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PR (failure in unit tests):\r\n```\r\n$ test/functional/test_runner.py --jobs=18 --cachedir=/mnt/tmp/cache --tmpdir=/mnt/tmp test/functional/feature_framework_unit_tests.py\r\nTemporary test directory at /mnt/tmp/test_runner_₿_🏃_20240403_193325\r\nRemaining jobs: [feature_framework_unit_tests.py]\r\n1/1 - feature_framework_unit_tests.py failed, Duration: 0 s\r\n\r\nstdout:\r\n.F\r\n======================================================================\r\nFAIL: test_bech32_decode (test_framework.address.TestFrameworkScript.test_bech32_decode)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/dev/myrepos/bitcoin/test/functional/test_framework/address.py\", line 228, in test_bech32_decode\r\n    self.assertEqual(False, True)\r\nAssertionError: False != True\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRan 2 tests in 0.003s\r\n\r\nFAILED (failures=1)\r\n\r\nstderr:\r\n\r\n\r\nTEST                            | STATUS    | DURATION\r\n\r\nfeature_framework_unit_tests.py | ✖ Failed  | 0 s\r\n\r\nALL                             | ✖ Failed  | 0 s (accumulated) \r\nRuntime: 0 s\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
