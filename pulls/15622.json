I agree on a zero-globals policy, enforced with singletons, or with a \"state\" class that is a container of all the globals, or with a dedicated namespace. This way, every time a new global has to be added (rarely), we can see a clear change in a single place. In my mind this policy should not be enforced from now, but should be accepted, then written in doc/developer-notes.md or elsewhere, and enforced after a couple of years, when all the open PRs are already compliant.\r\n\r\nI've just described this method of long grace periods in my [comment on #15465](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15465#issuecomment-475914641).",
