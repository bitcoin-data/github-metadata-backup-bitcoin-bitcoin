    "body": "`fclose(3)` may fail to flush the previously written data to disk, thus a failing `fclose(3)` is as serious as a failing `fwrite(3)`.\r\n\r\nPreviously the code ignored `fclose(3)` failures. This PR improves that by changing all users of `AutoFile` that use it to write data to explicitly close the file and handle a possible error.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther alternatives are:\r\n\r\n1. `fflush(3)` after each write to the file (and throw if it fails from the `AutoFile::write()` method) and hope that `fclose(3)` will then always succeed. Assert that it succeeds from the destructor :roll_eyes:. Will hurt performance.\r\n2. Throw nevertheless from the destructor. Exception within the exception in C++ I think results in terminating the program without a useful message.\r\n3. (this is implemented in the latest incarnation of this PR) Redesign `AutoFile` so that its destructor cannot fail. Adjust _all_ its users :sob:. For example, if the file has been written to, then require the callers to explicitly call the `AutoFile::fclose()` method before the object goes out of scope. In the destructor, as a sanity check, assume/assert that this is indeed the case. Defeats the purpose of a RAII wrapper for `FILE*` which automatically closes the file when it goes out of scope and there are a lot of users of `AutoFile`.\r\n4. Pass a new callback function to the `AutoFile` constructor which will be called from the destructor to handle `fclose()` errors, as described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29307#issuecomment-2243842400. My thinking is that if that callback is going to only log a message, then we can log the message directly from the destructor without needing a callback. If the callback is going to do more complicated error handling then it is easier to do that at the call site by directly calling `AutoFile::fclose()` instead of getting the `AutoFile` object out of scope (so that its destructor is called) and inspecting for side effects done by the callback (e.g. set a variable to indicate a failed `fclose()`).",

      "body": "Concept ACK, approach ~0\r\n\r\nThe PR description is a bit vague about how it is changing the AutoFile API.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the autofile API *allowed* but did not *require* AutoFile callers to check for failing `fclose` calls after writing. Now it requires that callers call the `fclose` method manually and explicitly use or discard its return value.\r\n\r\nChecking for failing `fclose` calls is important because if a call fails, it probably indicates that there is a serious problem that should trigger a log message or an alert. Specifically if the file was used for writing it could mean that data could not successfully be saved to disk. So it would be bad for `fclose` errors to be discarded without being handled at all or reported somewhere.\r\n\r\nThe PR makes AutoFile require callers to handle failing fclose calls, and it enforces this in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. It adds `[[nodiscard]]` annotation to the `fclose` method so its return value cannot be ignored. The return value is 0 if successful or `EOF` (-1) if unsuccessful.\r\n2. It tries to enforce that callers actually invoke `fclose` by adding an `Assume` statement to the destructor that terminates the program with a fatal error if the file was written to and fclose was not called and the binary was built in a debug mode.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this approach works, but it is maybe a little fragile because it doesn't actually enforce that caller handles the fclose result in every code path. So for example if an early return statement is added after a caller opens an autofile object but before it calls the fclose method, and the early return code path is not normally executed, it can introduce a latent bug that occasionally will crash debug builds, while providing no indication that anything is wrong in release builds.\r\n\r\nI think if the goal is to require AutoFile callers to handle failing fclose calls, a more reliable way to do that would be to change the constructor signature to\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nexplicit AutoFile(std::FILE* file, std::function<void()> on_error);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd require the caller to provide an on_error callback that does error handing like\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n[&] {\r\n        remove(pathTmp);\r\n        LogError(\"%s: Failed to close file %s: %s\\n\", __func__, fs::PathToString(pathTmp), SysErrorString(errno));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the current approach is ok too, but it seems more fragile because it doesn't detect all programming errors, and when it does it detects them with a runtime crash instead of a compile time error.\r\n\r\nI am coming to this late, so if you are really attached to the current approach I can just review and ack it, but I wanted to suggest an alternative.",

Not on any error? E.g. the `write()` method throws an exception on error.\r\n\r\nNot all callers have the file name when creating `AutoFile` which means we would have to log some generic message without a file name. Or go an extra mile and make sure we have the file name, but some callers don't use _files_ at all, IIRC the fuzzer uses some cookie \"files\" that are not on the filesystem.\r\n\r\nThen the callback can be omitted and the message can be logged from the destructor:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n     ~AutoFile()\r\n     {   \r\n         if (m_was_written) {\r\n             // Callers that wrote to the file must have closed it explicitly\r\n             // with the fclose() method and checked that the close succeeded.\r\n             // This is because here from the destructor we have no way to signal\r\n             // error due to close which, after write, could mean the file is\r\n             // corrupted and must be handled properly at the call site.\r\n             Assume(IsNull());\r\n         }\r\n                        \r\n-        (void)fclose();\r\n+        if (fclose() != 0) {\r\n+            LogError(\"Failed to close file: %s\\n\", SysErrorString(errno));\r\n+        }\r\n     }\r\n```",

I attempted an alternative implementation ([branch](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...hodlinator:bitcoin:pr/29307_suggestions_prime)) [inspired by ryanofsky's comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29307#issuecomment-2243842400) that takes a lambda in the constructor which is called upon `fclose()`-failure in the destructor. This enforces the context-aware handling of the issue at *compile-time*. The change was somewhat invasive but I'm curious to hear what others make of it. (It also splits `AutoFile` into `FileReader` and `FileWriter` (naming inspired by other types in *streams.h*)).",

I think `Truncate()` - yes because it changes the contents of the file. Changed.\r\n\r\n`Commit()` does not, so I left it alone. In other words - if a file is opened, none of the `write()`, `write_buffer()` or `Truncate()` is called, `Commit()` is called, and the file object is destroyed, could that be a problem? I think no because the contents of the file was not changed.",

It should be left for the caller to decide about the error.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if you want to do this, you'd have to apply it to both branches of the `if`. The error message shouldn't differ just because a file is xor'd or not.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would be good to explain whether this is a bugfix or a refactor/belt-and-suspenders. I don't think an error/eof could have occurred if the full `dst.size()` was read. So I don't think this is needed, but I could be wrong. Ideally, there is a unit test showing why the change is needed.",

This is not feasible because there are many users of `AutoFile`. However, some of those users already do call the `fclose()` method explicitly. For those users it is easy and I added checks whether `fclose()` succeeds. `DumpMempool()` is such a user and the change is:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n             throw std::runtime_error(\"FileCommit failed\");\r\n-        file.fclose();           \r\n+        if (file.fclose() != 0) {    \r\n+            throw std::runtime_error(\r\n+                strprintf(\"Error closing %s: %s\", fs::PathToString(file_fspath), SysErrorString(errno)));\r\n+        }\r\n         if (!RenameOver(dump_path + \".new\", dump_path)) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor consistency in `DumpMempool()` I changed all code paths in that function to explicitly call `fclose()`. There are two codepaths and this added `(void)file.fclose();` is the other one. I ignore the return value because this is already failure handling and the function is going to return `false`.

It mimics 1:1 the libc [fclose(3)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fclose.3.html) which is in line with the majority of the other system functions which:\r\n\r\n> return the value 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error\r\n\r\nI don't think that is \"fake\" and I do not know why it would be confusing. It is well established. The benefit of mimicking 1:1 is that there is _zero learning curve_ for people that read the Bitcoin Core code and are familiar with the libc functions.",

(This assumes that the thrown exception is worse than the failure to close the file, which may not always be true).\r\n\r\nFor other cases I ended up with scopes and extra variables to check for failures, like in your examples in the comment above. Agree that it would be nice to find something more elegant... and until we do, your current approach in this PR seems okay.\r\n\r\nnit: I still think the user-provided lambda in destructor approach merits an alternative 4 in the PR description.",
