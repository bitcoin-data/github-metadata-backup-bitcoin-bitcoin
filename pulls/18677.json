    "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR consists of build changes only. It adds an `--enable-multiprocess` autoconf option (off by default and marked experimental), that builds new `bitcoin-node` and `bitcoin-gui` binaries. These currently function the same as existing `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` binaries, but are extended in #10102 with IPC features to execute node, wallet, and gui functions in separate processes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to adding the `--enable-multiprocess` config flag, it also adds a depends package and autoconf rules to build with the [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) library, and it adds new travis configuration to exercise the build code and run functional tests with the new binaries.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR were originally part of #10102 but were moved into #16367 to be able to develop and review the multiprocess build changes independently of the code changes. #16367 was briefly merged and then reverted in #18588. Only change since #16367 has been dropping the `native_boost.mk` depends package which was pointed out to be no longer necessary in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16367#issuecomment-596484337 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18588#pullrequestreview-391765649",

I assume we aren't using any parts of it that require OpenSSL, and we might as well opt out of any [autodetection](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/blob/master/c%2B%2B/configure.ac#L148) and/or additional compilation.\r\n\r\nAlso, I didn't notice before, but just wanted to note that building capnp currently [requires gnu extensions](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/blob/master/c%2B%2B/CMakeLists.txt#L69). This is at odds with our current [compiler requirements](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18088).",

I fixed this and more problems with it in the latest push.\r\n\r\n> Would you prefer these issues opened here or the libmultiprocess repo?\r\n\r\nThis was a depends system issue so it made sense here, but in general it can be hard to pin down where issues arise so either place should be fine\r\n\r\n> Can we pass `--with-openssl=no` (+ any other relevant flags) to the capnp configure? I assume we aren't using any parts of it that require OpenSSL, and we might as well opt out of any [autodetection](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/blob/master/c%2B%2B/configure.ac#L148) and/or additional compilation.\r\n\r\nI think you'd have to write an openssl depends package and add it to `$(package)_dependencies` in capnp.mk for there to be anything to detect. But maybe requesting to be built without openssl when openssl isn't available would be a good way to demonstrate not liking openssl\r\n\r\n> Also, I didn't notice before, but just wanted to note that building capnp currently [requires gnu extensions](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/blob/master/c%2B%2B/CMakeLists.txt#L69). This is at odds with our current [compiler requirements](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18088).\r\n\r\nI don't think gnu extensions are required, and I don't see any problem building without them (following regular build steps but passing CXXFLAGS=-std=c++14 to configure). Digging into the history of this check it looks like it was added to work around a cygwin bug where snprintf wasn't declared with -std=c++0x, but was with -std=gnu++0x\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/capnproto/l46nHozrhCY/vJTHMkJC-ZEJ\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/capnproto/l46nHozrhCY/UG__SqiVbywJ\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/20149633/how-to-use-snprintf-in-g-std-c11-version-4-8-2",

I fixed the a similar problem on travis by installing the [libc6-dev-amd64-cross](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libc6-dev-amd64-cross) package, and maybe there is a similar package for mint. Either way, I'm going to try to reproduce the problem and eliminate the need for that dependency (details in #18915). IMO, it does not need to block this PR, but I will try to fix it soon anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I fixed the a similar problem on travis by installing the [libc6-dev-amd64-cross](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libc6-dev-amd64-cross) package, and maybe there is a similar package for mint. Either way, I'm going to try to reproduce the problem and eliminate the need for that dependency (details in #18915). IMO, it does not need to block this PR, but I will try to fix it soon anyway.\r\n\r\nThanks, it works. Btw, Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu's code base.",

It's difficult to follow the threads in this PR and know in advance which problems are related, but I want to suggest if anybody sees any problems or errors at all with this PR please just go to https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/new and make a new issue pasting the error and build commands, and please open different issues if there are different problems.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18677#pullrequestreview-408292513\r\n\r\n> I fixed the a similar problem on travis by installing the [libc6-dev-amd64-cross](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libc6-dev-amd64-cross) package, and maybe there is a similar package for mint\r\n\r\nNow with the new update, it should no longer be necessary to install this package;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18677#issuecomment-625988135\r\n\r\n> I was unable to build depends for [e1a8c36](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/e1a8c361c26ae3251b21f505f9538336fdb14155) on macOS 10.15.4,:\r\n\r\nI think this should be fixed in the latest update which switches back to a native build.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18677#issuecomment-625988135\r\n\r\n> Starting tests with `BITCOIND` breaks the backwards compatibility test: `BITCOIND=bitcoin-node test/functional/feature_backwards_compatibility.py`\r\n\r\nI tried to reproduce this, but didn't couldn't get the problem to happen. As mentioned in the earlier reply https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18677#issuecomment-625996555, it's difficult to see how changes from this PR or from setting the BITCOIND variable could cause `v0.19.0.1/bin/bitcoind` binary not to be found. My attempt to reproduce looked like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit checkout e1a8c361c26ae3251b21f505f9538336fdb14155\r\n./autogen.sh\r\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/russ/src/libmultiprocess/prefix/lib/pkgconfig\r\n./configure --disable-ccache --enable-multiprocess\r\nmake\r\ncontrib/devtools/previous_release.sh -b v0.15.2 v0.16.3 v0.17.1 v0.18.1 v0.19.0.1\r\nBITCOIND=bitcoin-node test/functional/feature_backwards_compatibility.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould definitely encourage creating an issue so we can get to the bottom of this at https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/new if you still see this error.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18677#issuecomment-626118471\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> test_framework.test_node.FailedToStartError: [node 0] bitcoind exited with status -11 during initialization\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nI tried to follow the same steps to reproduce but couldn't get this issue to happen. There's a chance this could be fixed in the latest update if there was some inconsitency in the depends sysroots causing this error. For for this error to happen at this point in the test is pretty mysterious given node would have had to start successfully before this. Would encourage creating an issue at https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/new if this error still happens or if you see any new errors from this PR. Here are steps I tried to reproduce this with:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit checkout e1a8c361c26ae3251b21f505f9538336fdb14155\r\nmake -C depends MULTIPROCESS=1 NO_QT=1 V=1\r\n./autogen.sh\r\nCONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/share/config.site ./configure --disable-ccache\r\nmake\r\nBITCOIND=bitcoin-node test/functional/wallet_multiwallet.py\r\n```\r\n",

Without depends still works fine too, using `capnp` 0.7.0 from homebrew, and the latest `libmultiprocess` self compiled. Ideally you should tag a `libmultiprocess` (pre-)release after this lands in master, or right before 0.21 branches off.\r\n\r\nI'm no longer able to reproduce a problem with `BITCOIND=bitcoin-node test/functional/feature_backwards_compatibility.py`\r\n\r\nDirect link to IRC meeting log for April 16th: http://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/bitcoin-core-dev/2020/bitcoin-core-dev.2020-04-16-19.03.log.html#l-243 \r\n\r\n>> I thought we were going to pivot this to just add a `-process=node/wallet/gui` option to the same `bitcoin-qt` binary?\r\n\r\n>  think the current naming is better, but I pointed out in the IRC meeting it is easy to change. \r\n\r\nI think separate binaries is a better approach for now. For development I'd like to have them both, so I don't have to reconfigure to see if a bug is related to the multiprocess stuff. I imagine at some point we'll feel comfortable shipping the multi-process binaries, with their dependencies, but not comfortable enough to make them the default.",

But internally (after [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102)), `bitcoin-gui` will spawn a `bitcoin-node` process to run P2P and RPC code, communicating with it across a socket pair, and `bitcoin-node` will spawn `bitcoin-wallet` to run wallet code, also communicating over a socket pair. This will let node, wallet, and GUI code run in separate address spaces for better isolation, and allow future improvements like being able to start and stop components independently on different machines and environments.\n+\n+## Next steps\n+\n+Specific next steps after [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) will be:\n+\n+- [ ] Adding `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options to `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables so they can listen and connect to TCP ports and unix socket paths. This will allow separate processes to be started and stopped any time and connect to each other.\n+- [ ] Adding `-server` and `-rpcbind` options to the `bitcoin-wallet` executable so wallet processes can handle RPC requests directly without going through the node.\n+- [ ] Supporting windows, not just unix systems. The existing socket code is already cross-platform, so the only windows-specific code that needs to be written is code spawning a process and passing a socket descriptor. This can be implemented with `CreateProcess` and `WSADuplicateSocket`. Example: https://memset.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/win32-api-passing-socket-with-ipc-method/.\n+- [ ] Adding sandbox features, restricting subprocess access to resources and data. See [https://eklitzke.org/multiprocess-bitcoin](https://eklitzke.org/multiprocess-bitcoin).\n+\n+## Debugging\n+\n+After [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102), the `-debug=ipc` command line option can be used to see requests and responses between processes.\n+\n+## Installation\n+\n+The multiprocess feature requires [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/) and [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) as dependencies. A simple way to get starting using it without installing these dependencies manually is to use the [depends system](../depends) with the `MULTIPROCESS=1` [dependency option](../depends#dependency-options) passed to make:\n+\n+```\n+cd <BITCOIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY>\n+make -C depends NO_QT=1 MULTIPROCESS=1\n+./configure --prefix=$PWD/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\n+make\n+src/bitcoin-node -regtest -printtoconsole -debug=ipc",

I did look at the commit comments about passing `--sysroot` and missing includes, however from what I can tell, there should be no change in behaviour with this diff. I did run a few compilation tests and didn't see any obvious difference in compile flags/includes etc.\r\n\r\nThe comment the PR description links to is https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16367#issuecomment-594600985. If you follow the instructions there creating `test.cpp` `echo '#include <stdlib.h>' > test.cpp` and running `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/clang++ -c test.cpp`, then you can see if the problem affects your system.\r\n\r\nIt has something to do with the SDK version:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/9050#issuecomment-429674155\r\n- https://discourse.brew.sh/t/clang-can-no-longer-find-usr-include-header-files-fatal-error-stdlib-h-file-not-found/4523\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52509602/cant-compile-c-program-on-a-mac-after-upgrade-to-mojave/52530212#52530212\r\n\r\nMy original fix from those comments was https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commit/d6921b176186fd8304b6d6a13772fd0fc32fe726, but Cory's suggestion https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commit/04bec8d2844e0cd2e09a62b21b006292f33f8093 seemed better: just use native compiler for native packages, not the sdk compiler.\r\n\r\n> My assumption is that the problems seen ([chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess#5](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/5), [#16367 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16367#issuecomment-592093081)) might have been due to an issue with the development environments i.e missing SDK headers, not installing the CommandLineTools etc.\r\n\r\nNot unless running the `shell xcrun -f clang` compiler without a sysroot option is supposed to work.\r\n\r\n> Mostly curious because if this was an issue it seems like it shouldn't be multiprocess specific?\r\n\r\nIt's not, just a bad interaction with native packages that don't specify --sysroot, which we didn't have previously.\r\n\r\n> It also seems strange to drop the `xcrun` call only for clang/clang++, and not for the rest of the tools.\r\n\r\nThat's a good point. It didn't occur to me to test changing all the other tools paths when I adopted Cory's fix, and at the moment I don't have a convenient way to retest. My original fix https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commit/d6921b176186fd8304b6d6a13772fd0fc32fe726 doesn't have this inconsistency, and I'd be happy to switch back to it if it's preferable.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to have automated test coverage for this. It seems curious that the one osx job we have on travis does _not_ test depends, IIUC?",

But internally (after [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102)), `bitcoin-gui` will spawn a `bitcoin-node` process to run P2P and RPC code, communicating with it across a socket pair, and `bitcoin-node` will spawn `bitcoin-wallet` to run wallet code, also communicating over a socket pair. This will let node, wallet, and GUI code run in separate address spaces for better isolation, and allow future improvements like being able to start and stop components independently on different machines and environments.\n+\n+## Next steps\n+\n+Specific next steps after [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) will be:\n+\n+- [ ] Adding `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options to `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables so they can listen and connect to TCP ports and unix socket paths. This will allow separate processes to be started and stopped any time and connect to each other.\n+- [ ] Adding `-server` and `-rpcbind` options to the `bitcoin-wallet` executable so wallet processes can handle RPC requests directly without going through the node.\n+- [ ] Supporting windows, not just unix systems. The existing socket code is already cross-platform, so the only windows-specific code that needs to be written is code spawning a process and passing a socket descriptor. This can be implemented with `CreateProcess` and `WSADuplicateSocket`. Example: https://memset.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/win32-api-passing-socket-with-ipc-method/.\n+- [ ] Adding sandbox features, restricting subprocess access to resources and data. See [https://eklitzke.org/multiprocess-bitcoin](https://eklitzke.org/multiprocess-bitcoin).\n+\n+## Debugging\n+\n+After [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102), the `-debug=ipc` command line option can be used to see requests and responses between processes.\n+\n+## Installation\n+\n+The multiprocess feature requires [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/) and [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) as dependencies. A simple way to get starting using it without installing these dependencies manually is to use the [depends system](../depends) with the `MULTIPROCESS=1` [dependency option](../depends#dependency-options) passed to make:\n+\n+```\n+cd <BITCOIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY>\n+make -C depends NO_QT=1 MULTIPROCESS=1\n+./configure --prefix=$PWD/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\n+make\n+src/bitcoin-node -regtest -printtoconsole -debug=ipc",

LIBMULTIPROCESS_CFLAGS and LIBMULTIPROCESS_LIBS are set by the configure script and used in the makefile.\r\n\r\nIf the question is why are the variables set in this PR when they are not used until #10102, the answer is that I would like all the configure changes to be reviewed here as a complete unit so they make more sense, and so  #10102 reviewers can just review c++ code without being forced to look at m4 macros in configure code.\r\n\r\nIf the question is why is the makefile not specifying LIBMULTIPROCESS_LIBS in this PR, the answer is I'd be happy to add it in this PR, but am a little concerned that if I add it, someone will come back 3 weeks from now asking me why it is added when it is not currently needed.\r\n\r\nI do appreciate these reviews, but would also appreciate more context for the questions. If there is a concern about a bug, what kind of bug is it? If it's a concern about clarity, is there something beyond these two lines of code that is confusing?
