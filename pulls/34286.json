    "body": "## Summary\n\nThis PR replaces the TODO comment in `wallet_assumeutxo.py` (line 242) with actual test assertions that verify node and wallet behavior after a restart during assumeutxo background sync.\n\n## Changes\n\nThe new tests verify:\n- Two chainstates exist (background validation not complete)\n- Background chainstate is still at `START_HEIGHT`\n- Snapshot chainstate has synced to at least `PAUSE_HEIGHT`\n- Wallets cannot be loaded after restart (expected behavior)\n- Wallet backup from before snapshot height cannot be restored\n\n## Motivation\n\nDuring implementation, I discovered that **wallets cannot be loaded after a node restart during assumeutxo background sync**. This is expected behavior because:\n- The wallet loading code checks if required blocks are available for rescanning\n- During assumeutxo background sync, blocks before the snapshot are not available\n- This applies to all wallets, including watch-only wallets created at the snapshot height\n\nThis is a valuable test addition because it documents this expected behavior and ensures it doesn't regress. Users should be aware that if they restart their node during assumeutxo background sync, they won't be able to load their wallets until the background sync completes.\n\n## Related\n\nrefs #28648\n\nAddresses the TODO comment that was originally added as part of the assumeutxo wallet test implementation.",

You were right that the CI failed.\r\n\r\nThe failure showed `AssertionError: not(360 == 359)` - the snapshot chainstate was at height 360, not 359.\r\n\r\nThis confirms what the `stopatheight` documentation says: *\"Blocks after target height may be processed during shutdown.\"*\r\n\r\nI've reverted back to `assert_greater_than_or_equal` with a clearer comment explaining why:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# The snapshot chainstate should be at least PAUSE_HEIGHT. It may be\r\n# higher because stopatheight may allow additional blocks to be\r\n# processed during shutdown (per stopatheight documentation).\r\nassert_greater_than_or_equal(chainstates[1]['blocks'], PAUSE_HEIGHT)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI kept the `[1]` index suggestion since that's still clearer when we've verified `len(chainstates) == 2`.",

Fixed by:\r\n\r\n- Created `wallet_loading_error` base string and reused it with the appropriate heights (`SNAPSHOT_BASE_HEIGHT` before restart, `SNAPSHOT_BASE_HEIGHT + 1` after restart)\r\n- Renamed the descriptor error variable to `descriptor_import_error` so it doesn't clobber the wallet one\r\n- Now verifying the full error message including the target height\r\n\r\nNoticed something interesting while testing: after restart, all wallet loading errors show height 300 regardless of wallet creation time.",
