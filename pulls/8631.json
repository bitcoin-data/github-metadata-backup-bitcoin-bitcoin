    "body": "This replaces #8023 with a solution that moves us directly to std::thread, rather than using an intermediate wrapper.\n### Background\n\nstd::thread is pretty much a drop-in replacement for boost::thread, except that boost::thread is interruptible. We've used those interruptions, but we'll have to drop them eventually as they didn't become part of the spec.\n\nWhen an interruption point is hit, it throws an instance of boost::thread_interrupted. boost::thread catches these automatically by default.\n\nThe interruption points are defined as:\n\n```\n\n    boost::thread::join()\n    boost::thread::timed_join()\n    boost::thread::try_join_for(),\n    boost::thread::try_join_until(),\n    boost::condition_variable::wait()\n    boost::condition_variable::timed_wait()\n    boost::condition_variable::wait_for()\n    boost::condition_variable::wait_until()\n    boost::condition_variable_any::wait()\n    boost::condition_variable_any::timed_wait()\n    boost::condition_variable_any::wait_for()\n    boost::condition_variable_any::wait_until()\n    boost::thread::sleep()\n    boost::this_thread::sleep_for()\n    boost::this_thread::sleep_until()\n    boost::this_thread::interruption_point()\n```\n\nThe ones relevant to us are primarily `boost::condition_variable_any::wait()`, `boost::this_thread::sleep_for()`, and of course `boost::this_thread::interruption_point()`\n\nAny boost::thread will immediately throw boost::thread_interrupted if those are hit at any point. So we can't simply s/boost::thread/std::thread/g, as we would never be able to exit.\n### Changes\n- All threads are now externally interruptible. Rather than having a single bool for shutting down, I've attempted to notify each relevant subsystem. But because they're not well-defined, the notifications are somewhat arbitrary as well.\n- For long-running threads, our own `thread_interrupted` and `interruption_point` have been added.\n- Threads should call TraceThread if they may hit an interruption_point.\n- MilliSleep is no longer interruptible.\n- boost::thread_group is gone. All threads are now managed individually\n### Future changes\n\nThere is lots of cleanup to be done post-merge. I was very tempted to include cleanups here, but I've elected to keep the changes minimal. Todo:\n- s/boost::mutex/std::mutex/\n- s/boost::condition_variable/std::condition_variable/\n- s/boost::chrono/std::chrono/\n- Drop a ton of boost includes\n- Drop other boost cruft (like catching `boost::thread_interrupted`)\n\nAlso, I started on this by creating a base class for launching threads. Each instance would be responsible for implementing Interrupt() and Stop(). But because this is already a complex set of changes, I think it's best to do that as a separate step.\n",

In my code for https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8464 I have also removed boost::thread and interruption points, preferring more explicit quitting. Dealing with the interruption code made working on #8464  more difficult than it had to be.\n\nOne Nit, which I think is worth addressing. I would refactor the names from Interrupt to Quit, Shutdown, or even ControlledExit. Connotation of interrupt is a non-consensual break, whereas Quit or Shutdown implies being done as a normal part of control flow.\n",

      "body": ">  Nearly every thread uses separate interrupt/shutdown calls for exactly that reason.\n\nThere's another reason, and that is that interrupt is supposed to be an instant operation at the caller site, and shutdown is allowed to wait. This allows parallelism in the shutdown process:\n- Send module A interrupt  (A starts terminating its threads, which may take some time)\n- Send module B interrupt  (B starts terminating its threads, which may take some time)\n\n...\n- Module A shutdown (waits for A's threads to join)\n- Module B shutdown (waits for B's threads to join)\n\nSure, the naming may not be optimal, \"interrupt\" is more like a hint to stop work, but I think the approach makes sense.\n\n(I'm sure this can be implemented more thoroughly with explicit shutdown-dependencies and std::futures, but the idea is the same, to make shutdown as fast as possible)\n\nEdit: re-triggered travis, the failure was a timeout, probably has nothing to do with the changes here.\n",

So let's do these case-by-case.\n- I don't think we can get rid of the exception throwing yet. I hate the interruption_point logic, but I don't think it's realistic to remove it all in one PR. I certainly agree with minimizing it though.\n- Agree on losing the binds where possible\n- Without the scriptcheck changes, this can't be tested as we can't shutdown. So I'm afraid we'll have to step on eachother's toes until one is merged. Obviously I'm happy to drop the scriptcheck changes and adapt to the new stuff if it goes in first.\n",
