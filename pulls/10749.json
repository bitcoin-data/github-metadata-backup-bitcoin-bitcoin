The goal of this PR is to get rid of enum hacks. Changing existing `const`:s to `constexpr`:s is not within that scope :-)\r\n3. When introducing new compile-time constants I prefer `constexpr` which is explicit about the intention of the code (getting a *compile-time* constant). Do you see any compelling reasons to avoid using `constexpr` (which implies `const`) for compile-time constants?",
