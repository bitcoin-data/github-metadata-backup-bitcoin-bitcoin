    "body": "This commit adds support for ekeys, or encrypted private keys, to the wallet.\nAll keys are stored in memory in their encrypted form and thus the passphrase\nis required from the user to spend coins, or to create new addresses.\n\nKeys are encrypted with AES-256-CBC through OpenSSL's EVP library. The key is\ncalculated via EVP_BytesToKey using AES256 with 1000 rounds.\n\nEach RPC command which requires the password in practice has an additional\nparameter, namely that password.  Due to the need to convert the types of\nother parameters before sending them, users who do not use encryption (via\nthe -nocrypt option) will have to specify a blank string (or any string) as\nthe first parameter, followed by the command they currently use.\n\nWhenever keying material (unencrypted private keys, the user's password, the\nwallet's AES key) is stored unencrypted in memory, any reasonable attempt is\nmade to mlock/VirtualLock that memory before storing the keying material.\nThis is not true in several (commented) cases where mlock/VirtualLocking the\nmemory is not possible.\n\nAlthough encryption of private keys in memory can be very useful on desktop\nsystems (as some small amount of protection against stupid viruses), on an\nRPC server, the password is entered fairly insecurely. Thus, the only main\nadvantage encryption has for RPC servers is for RPC servers that do not spend\ncoins, except in rare cases, eg. a webserver of a merchant which only receives\npayment except for cases of manual intervention.\n\nThanks to jgarzik for the original patch and sipa for all his input.\n",

      "message": "Add wallet privkey encryption.\n\nThis commit adds support for ekeys, or encrypted private keys, to the wallet.\nAll keys are stored in memory in their encrypted form and thus the passphrase\nis required from the user to spend coins, or to create new addresses.\n\nKeys are encrypted with AES-256-CBC through OpenSSL's EVP library. The key is\ncalculated via EVP_BytesToKey using AES256 with 1000 rounds.\n\nWhen the user is attempting to call RPC functions which require the password\nto unlock the wallet, an error will be returned unless they call\nwalletpassword <password> <time to keep key in memory> first.\n\nA topupkeypool command has been added which tops up the users keypool\n(requiring the password via walletpassword first).\nkeypoolsize has been added to the output of getinfo to show the user the\nnumber of keys left before they need to specify their password and call\ntopupkeypool.\n\nA walletpasswordchange <oldpassword> <newpassword> has been added to allow\nthe user to change their password via RPC.\n\nWhenever keying material (unencrypted private keys, the user's password, the\nwallet's AES key) is stored unencrypted in memory, any reasonable attempt is\nmade to mlock/VirtualLock that memory before storing the keying material.\nThis is not true in several (commented) cases where mlock/VirtualLocking the\nmemory is not possible.\n\nAlthough encryption of private keys in memory can be very useful on desktop\nsystems (as some small amount of protection against stupid viruses), on an\nRPC server, the password is entered fairly insecurely. Thus, the only main\nadvantage encryption has for RPC servers is for RPC servers that do not spend\ncoins, except in rare cases, eg. a webserver of a merchant which only receives\npayment except for cases of manual intervention.\n\nThanks to jgarzik for the original patch and sipa for all his input.",

Otherwise, you wind up with a lot of code that doesn't do anything and may obscure what's _really_ going on. \n\nre: calls to SetKey mlocking -- if that's the case, then you _really_ don't need to copy it to vchKey. All that serves to do is increase the number of copies of keys you have in memory and increases your attack surface.\n\nSecurity-wise: careful, minimal code > paranoid code.

So it's much harder to parallelize an attack with, e.g., an ASIC, as you would need lots of RAM to do so.\n\nBut I agree with you: There have been much more reviews of the SSL code base, and so the chance of critical errors in OpenSSL is much lower compared to scrypt.\n",

This patch already uses the public key as the IV for the encryption of each private key so any kind of brute force/dictionary attack is already ridiculously difficult, I dont see a major advantage to adding a random salt to be used for a given wallet (and then stored in the wallet) as to brute force a wallet, you already need to know some of the information in the wallet (namely the public keys).  But maybe others disagree?\n\n@sysfrog OK, so its agreed then that OpenSSL key derivation is probably the best way to go?\n\n@dizzyd Still planning on updating with some of your original recommendations, but I'm on vacation atm and dont feel like doing much coding.\n",
