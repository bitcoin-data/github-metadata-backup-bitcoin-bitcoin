    "body": "This PR is supposed to provide context for some of the refactoring PRs I've been working on (#25268, #26621, etc).\r\n\r\nThe aim is to completely decouple CConnman and its internals from PeerManager to allow for isolated testing of our message processing code (isolated from net only as isolating from validation is another can of worms). To get there, this work refactors CConnman's API to use `NodeId` as the primary handle for managing connections and defines a new interface `ConnectionsInterface` that describes the interface between PeerManager and CConnman. The result is that CNode is no longer part of this interface and access to it is no longer needed within net processing.\r\n\r\nMost of the API simply shifts from `CConnman::DoX(CNode*)` to `CConnman::DoX(NodeId)` and where possible the PR minimizes the need for new methods on `CConnman` to avoid the slight overhead of (internally) locking `m_nodes_mutex` to look up the right `CNode` by its id.\r\n\r\nSome steps this PR is taking:\r\n\r\n- [ ] We can't test PeerManager in isolation if it is not the owner of its own state. Therefore this PR moves all the remaining application layer data from net to net processing.\r\n- [ ] Some use of CNode in net processing only accesses constant data that is available from the time of connection establishment. This PR introduces `ConnectionContext` which is meant to hold all this constant connection data and for each connection a copy is stored on the corresponding `Peer` instance. This reduces the need for accessing CNode in net processing and avoids some `For{Each}Node` calls (which are a horrible layer violation).\r\n- [ ] Some use of CNode in net processing directly modifies eviction related members of CNode. Instead of wrapping access to these members in CConnman methods, this PR creates a new manager (EvictionManager) that encapsulates the eviction logic as well as the required per-peer data (entirely removing the relevant CNode members).\r\n- [ ] To disconnect a peer , PeerManager directly sets the disconnection flag `CNode::fDisconnect` to true. This PR wraps access to that flag on `CConnman`, i.e. `CConnman::IsDisconnected` & `CConnman::DisconnectNode(NodeId)`.\r\n\r\nFinally, the PR also introduces initial unit tests for PeerManager that make use of a mocked `ConnectionsInterface` instead of the actual CConnman.\r\n\r\nLooking for conceptual & approach review.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is not super polished so I would expect the CI to fail but I will break this up and polish if there is enough conceptual support. I will not keep this rebased as the general architectural direction this is taking should be clear in any case.",

I think a simpler approach would be to add a `unique_ptr<Peer>` (and perhaps likewise for other per-peer data) to `CNode`, which is initialized via `NetEventsInterface::InitializeNode`. If you want to test `PeerManager` without a `CConnman`, it then becomes the test framework's job to set up a bunch of `CNode` objects and initialize them. In that world, the `Peer` struct is just the processing-related data members of `CNode`, and largely not something that should be passed around independently (let alone in addition to) the `CNode` its embedded in.",

I think we'll mostly disagree here but I appreciate your opinion.\r\n\r\n>> Most of the API simply shifts from CConnman::DoX(CNode*) to CConnman::DoX(NodeId)\r\n>\r\n> That seems undesirable to me? Where possible, acting directly on the node via a pointer/reference is much better than taking a global lock, doing a lookup, and then acting.\r\n\r\nWhile it is obviously true that directly accessing the CNode pointers is more performant (no locking or look ups), accessing internals of other components like this leads to spaghetti code and the performance win of micro or nano seconds is just not worth it.\r\n\r\n> I think a simpler approach would be to add a `unique_ptr<Peer>` (and perhaps likewise for other per-peer data) to `CNode`, which is initialized via `NetEventsInterface::InitializeNode`.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like doing a complete 180 on the work that happened over multiple years to decouple net and net processing. I'm not re-inventing the wheel in this PR, this general direction has been what other contributors have had in mind and worked on for multiple years. I'd prefer finishing up previous work and making things consistent instead of going in an entirely new direction.",

          "body": "Efficient isolated fuzzing of our message processing code (net processing) would be very valuable. However, to make that deterministic, fast and fuzzer friendly it appears that extensive refactoring is required. There are three main blockers: module separation (net/net processing/validation split), determinism, performance.\r\n\r\nI am gonna use this issue to track and motivate the work that needs to be done. It would be great if we can achieve the same outcome with less refactoring but I don't see how at the moment. Open to suggestions and feedback.\r\n\r\n### Module separation\r\n\r\nOnce we have a clean separation between our net, net processing and validation modules, we can fuzz/test them in isolation to maximize the bug yield (🐛, 🪲, 🪳). By design, most fuzzing engines are not great at finding bugs when the scope of the targets is too large (e.g. fuzzing net, net processing and validation all at once).\r\n\r\n* net / net processing split (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28252)\r\n  * Move application layer data from net to net processing ([#19398](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19398))\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26621\r\n  * Define a clean interface between net processing <-> net \r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25268\r\n      - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25500\r\n      - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25572\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27257\r\n* net processing / validation split (lots of overlap with kernel)\r\n  * Reduce `cs_main` usage in net processing\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26151\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26140\r\n    - [ ] Kill CNodeState\r\n  * Define a clean interface between net processing <-> validation\r\n\r\n### Determinism\r\n\r\nNon-deterministic fuzz targets are less efficient at finding bugs and debugging non-reproducible bugs is annoying/costly.\r\n\r\n* All required components should be newly setup for each target execution\r\n  * Can be done currently using our testing setup suite but that's waaaay too slow for fuzzing.\r\n* Avoid  `GetRand()` (mock it?)\r\n* Avoid globals (are there any globals left in net processing?)\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nFuzzing is a search, the faster the search - the better.\r\n\r\n* LevelDB (is in memory but still slow?)\r\n  * Probably solved by mocking out validation?\r\n* PeerManager construction is expensive because it requires multi megabyte allocations each time (mostly due to large bloom filters)\r\n* Disk usage\r\n  * Block storage\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125\r\n    - [ ] Create a mock of BlockManager for in memory block storage?\r\n  * BanMan (banlist is written to disk)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n* Decouple net processing from ArgsMan (args setup is slow)\r\n  * Allows to fuzz the peerman options without depending on the global args man \r\n  - [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27499\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you think there are PRs that aren't listed here but should be.\r\n",

      "body": "We've debated the CNode* passing/abstracting thing ever since CConnman was merged. This has come up over and over so it's definitely not new. And the big problem is: everyone has their own take. The question of \"should we use CNode or CConnman as the interface for network stuff\" could be debated forever. I think the only correct answer is \"not both arbitrarily\", which is what we do now.\r\n\r\nI commend @dergoegge for working on this. It's tough and requires picking an approach and sticking to it.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't love any solution, but NodeId as an access handle has always seemed like one of the most reasonable approaches to me. It's not the most sophisticated, but it's straightforward. And from my experiments years ago anyway, there were fewer footguns as there are no more external lifetime concerns. So Concept ACK from me on that part.\r\n\r\nWhat matters to me is that CConnman gets a clean separation and CNode's internals are no longer exposed. TBH I'm less concerned about the approach taken to get there. I understand that there may be a performance trade-off, but imo it's worth it for simplicity. I fully expect people to disagree, but if performance is the argument, imo it needs to be demonstrated.\r\n\r\n@ajtowns's take is also totally reasonable imo, just a matter of different priorities I think.",

Being immediately dismissed out of hand feels pretty frustrating.\r\n\r\n> It's challenging right now because we are passing internal pointers around.\r\n\r\nI don't really think that's at all true? Passing pointers to objects is a completely normal thing; and whether something is \"internal\"  or not is just a matter of how you define the api -- if other things are accessing it, it's not \"internal\" by definition, though perhaps it should be.\r\n\r\nI'd contend that the challenging things is mostly that we're letting nodes interact with other nodes' state directly.\r\n\r\n> It's really not that complicated if all you have to do is call moduleX.ForgetPeer(id) in FinalizeNode.\r\n\r\nIt also means either wrapping `*Assert(GetState(nodeid))`, doing a whole bunch of normally redundant `if (peer) ...` boilerplate after `peer = GetPeerRef(nodeid)`, or else leaving potential nullptr dereferences lying about. No, it's not *that* complicated, but it's largely unnecessary, same as using a possibly null pointer in a function param, when you could use an always-valid reference instead.\r\n\r\n> It mostly seems like a discussion of performance vs. sane interfaces and I don't think it is worth optimizing for performance in this specific case (at the cost of bad interfaces) as it doesn't represent a bottleneck either way.\r\n\r\nI don't think this approach is a \"sane\" interface -- interacting with many peers is fundamentally something we should be able to do in parallel, and adding many synchronisation points where we prevent ourselves from operating in parallel is a fundamentally broken approach. It's broken both from the perspective of \"it would be nice if we could do better in the future\", in that you're making those improvements harder, but it's also broken from the perspective of \"it's easier to avoid bugs when you can just focus on a single thing, and not have to worry about many interactions\".\r\n\r\nIgnoring the performance aspect, and just focussing on the \"net_processing deals with a single peer and doesn't interfere with the state of other peers\" would, I think, look like:\r\n\r\n * replace `ForNode` and `ForEachNode` with a callback -- ie, pass a lambda (with copy captures) back to connman, and have connman forward that lambda back to each peer to deal with as they choose\r\n * replace the `ForEachNode` loops on evictions with a cached score -- when you run `ProcessMessages` or `SendMessages` nodes update their eviction score, and connman tracks the worst scores so that when a node needs to be evicted it knows exactly which node to evict\r\n * ...and I think that's it? At that point all of `PeerManager` only needs to know about a single peer at any one time, which makes for simpler code (and makes parallelising net processing much more plausible, though that gets into \"performance\") Huh, that seems much simpler than I would have expected.\r\n\r\nHaving `PeerManager` only focus on a single peer also seems a much better design for fuzz (or unit) testing to me -- in the above model, you'd test interactions with other peers solely via the callbacks, eg, without ever necessarily having to actually instantiate multiple peers. Am I missing something there?\r\n\r\n(Actually parallelising the msghand thread probably depends on whether we can at least do parallel lookups into the mempool perhaps via a reader/writer lock approach, but something like this would be a necessary step too)",

I agree that that is cool but I also think we should have better testing (ideally implementation agnostic) before switching to that. In any case maybe it makes more sense to discuss that in another issue?\r\n\r\n> Actually parallelising the msghand thread probably depends on whether we can at least do parallel lookups into the mempool perhaps via a reader/writer lock approach, but something like this would be a necessary step too\r\n\r\nUsing `cs_main` for so many validation unrelated things is probably another blocker, but perhaps easier to solve.",

      "body": "I think I might be coming across as disagreeing more than I actually do? I'm all for modularisation and better testing, and getting things tightly focussed so that you don't need to keep huge amounts of context in your head; but I think the way we've been doing that in `net_processing` in many places is adding complexity and interrelationships rather than reducing them.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps a competing PR/design doc of what you are thinking about would help? I've thought about the design in this PR so much that I might be a little stuck in my ways now.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to move towards something more like:\r\n\r\n * `CTxMempool`, `TxRequestTracker`, `Chainstate`, etc: global high-level state accessed by `PeerManager`\r\n * `PeerManager`: deals with updating a *single* peer's logical/high-level state\r\n * `CConnman`: deals with collecting all our peers together, and prioritising which ones to service/connect/evict\r\n * `CNode`: deals with *all* of the state for a single peer\r\n    * high-level, protocol related state: `Peer m_peer; CNodeState m_state` (probably via an opaque `unique_ptr`)\r\n    * low-level, I/O state: `Sock m_sock`\r\n    * coordination vs other peers: `NodeId id; nRefCount; fPauseRecv; fDisconnect; ...`\r\n\r\nie, I guess I don't think `net`-vs-`net_processing` should be looked at as a \"high level\" vs \"low level\" split at all; but rather as the overall management of connections, who to keep, who to prioritise, etc (`CConnman`) vs the details of communicating with an individual connection, which messages to send, how to deal with messages you receive, etc (`net_processing`).\r\n\r\n(There's also a bunch of \"low-level\" things in `net` -- `CSerializedNetMsg`, `TransportSerializer`, `CNetMessage`; but those are all more related to message handling in `net_processing` than `CConnman`)\r\n\r\nMaybe think of it as `net_processing` as being like the bartender which gets you your drinks and listens to your sob stories; and `CConnman` is like the bouncer that lets you in in the first place or kicks you out when the bartender says you're causing trouble, or a celebrity arrives and they need to make space, or you're violating fire safety rules, or whatever. In that analogy, the things that go in `CNode` (rather than `Peer`) are the bits of info the bouncer cares about, either to read (`fDisconnect` = \"kick this guy out\") or as info to pass onto the bartender, like giving someone an stamp on their hand at an all ages venue, so that the bartender knows they can serve them alcohol without having to interrupt the bouncer to ask if they checked their age or not: it's simpler and more efficient if you can just look these things up directly, rather than having to ask someone. (The analogy breaks if you push it too far, of course)\r\n\r\nThat would imply a few implementation changes compared to master:\r\n\r\n * `PeerManager` doesn't have `m_peer_map` or `m_node_states`, or their associated locks (but does still have `m_txrequest` and other global state)\r\n * `PeerManager` shouldn't need a reference back to `CConnman` at all; when interacting with one peer generates work for other peers, that should be coordinated either via global state (mempool/txrequest/etc), or passing the extra work directly from `ProcessMessages`/`SendMessages` back to the `CConnman` that invoked it, which can then distribute the work to appropriate peers\r\n * peer I/O should be via `CNode` not `CConnman` (ie, move `PushMessage` into `CNode`, matching `PollMessage`)\r\n * `CValidationInterface` would have to implemented by `CConnman` instead of `PeerManager` (those functions apply across all nodes, so it needs to go through the container of all nodes)\r\n * similarly, the RPC functionality currently exposed through `PeerManager` would need to go through `CConnman` first, for the same reason\r\n * probably splitting `CNode` out of `net.h`, perhaps splitting `Peer`/`CNodeState` out of `net_processing.h` (so that `net_node.h` has an opaque `class Peer;`, but `net_node.cpp` can `#include <net_msgstate.h>` in order to implement `CNode::~CNode` and destruct its opaque `unique_ptr<Peer> m_peer`)\r\n\r\nI think an approach like that would have a few benefits:\r\n\r\n * breaks the circular dependency between `PeerManager` and `CConnman`\r\n * lets you test `PeerManager` in isolation without even instantiating a dummy `CConnman`\r\n * can require `PeerManager` to be passed into `CConnman` at construction, rather than at `connman->Start()`, simplifying its API\r\n * can have `CConnman` own its `NetEventsInterface` instead of and be responsible for destructing it (make the virtual destructor public), removing the risk that peerman gets destructed while connman is still using it\r\n * potentially lets you simplify the per-peer locks, since all access to nodes' high-level state goes via `CConnman`\r\n * keeps things efficient -- you're still separating things into logical modules, but not adding layers of lookups and indirection\r\n\r\n> Using `cs_main` for so many validation unrelated things is probably another blocker, but perhaps easier to solve.\r\n\r\n`mempool.cs` can also be a blocker for effective parallelisation -- you can't quite do tx relay to two peers concurrently when even looking up a txid via the mempool to see if an `INV` is a duplicate requires an exclusive lock, especially if that lock's held for an extended period (eg while validating a tx or block or reorging).\r\n\r\n> If you think this design is somehow fundamentally broken w.r.t. parallelizing, please elaborate why because I don't see it.\r\n\r\nIf you want good performance then you keep things simple -- few locks, access things directly. Often that approach is also simple and the easy to understand. Doing things in a complicated, round about way isn't \"fundamentally broken\" -- you can make it work, and you can always throw enough hardware at it to make it work fast enough. But I think it should be pretty obvious that:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool CNode::IsDisconnected() const { return fDisconnected; }\r\nvoid CNode::Disconnect() { fDisconnected = true; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nis simpler and more performant and better for parallelisation than\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool CConnman::IsDisconnected(NodeId id) const\r\n{\r\n    LOCK(m_nodes_mutex);\r\n    auto it = m_nodes.find(id);\r\n    return it == m_nodes.end() ||\r\n           it->second->fDisconnect;\r\n}\r\nbool CConnman::DisconnectNode(NodeId id)\r\n{\r\n    LOCK(m_nodes_mutex);\r\n    auto it = m_nodes.find(id);\r\n    if (it == m_nodes.end()) return false;\r\n    it->second->fDisconnect = true;\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe more complicated code here isn't doing anything clever to justify the complexity: it's still just reading/setting the same atomic bool. Both `PeerManager` and `CConnman` care about this bool, so it's not \"internal\" to one or the other.\r\n\r\nNow, sure: a quick map lookup while holding a global lock isn't the end of the world, but refactoring should be making things *simpler* or *more efficient* or both, and this is doing the opposite. That's why I think it's the wrong direction. If the design is forcing your code to be complicated, ugly and slow, then the design's bad.\r\n\r\nFor parallelisation in particular, you get best performance with the fewest locks (so you don't have to stop, and potentially have another process claim the cpu) and the least shared data (so you can just process it in cache without having to synchronise with other tasks). So adding locks and lookups over shared data on things that were previously just a single atomic operation is completely backwards.\r\n\r\nHere's a concrete example: https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/202308-netnode . It first splits out `CNode` and related things from net.h, then moves `PushMessage` into `CNode` (and so it doesn't require `m_connman.m_total_bytes_sent_mutex` or `m_connman` at all for sending messages), then also moves `GetAddresses()` into `PeerManager`. That drops the number of `m_connman` uses in `net_processing` from 80 to 27 by my count, so seems a decent start on cutting out the circular dep between `CConnman` and `PeerManager`. Dropping `connman.ForEachNode` and `for (peer : m_peer_map)` in this model is a whole other bunch of work, of course.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you look at `net` vs `net_processing` as low-vs-high level, moving `-maxsendbuffer` would be backwards; but if you look at it as \"message handling\" vs \"dealing with the collection of all nodes\" its logical: `maxsendbuffer` affects your communication with an individual node, it's not something that matters across nodes.",
