One risk I see is that the fuzzer might try to work also on \"meaningless\" inputs (inputs which cause `std::ios_base::failure`) which would now become \"somewhat meaningful\" due to default construction.\r\n\r\nTake the extreme example of a huge input containing a few million bytes worth of 0x41 scream (`AAAAAAAAAAA…`) being deserialized to an object of type `CFoo`. The current fuzzer would quickly reach `std::ios_base::failure`, return a `nullopt` and then give up without further processing (fail early thanks to `if (!opt_foo) { return; }` or similar). If we were to return a `CFoo{}` instead then the fuzzer would proceed with processing (fail late) which may slow down the fuzzing.\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense? :)\r\n\r\ntl;dr -- would be worth doing if no negative fuzzing speed impact can be measured :)\r\n\r\n_Edit: [Proof of concept here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...practicalswift:consume) if someone wants to experiment :)_",

      "body": "I think when it comes to trading off giving the fuzz test more freedom to explore more code branches vs micro-optimizing for performance, we should always pick the option that gives the fuzz engine more freedom. Fuzzing is great to complement traditional tests (e.g. our unit and functional tests). Those traditional tests offer a reasonable line coverage, but fuzz testing can offer great branch coverage. Giving the fuzz engine to explore as much branches as possible is vital. With modern coverage guided fuzz engines, the strength of fuzzing is that even with a large search space, the fuzz engine will always find useful inputs that increase coverage. Additional search space may (or may not!) come with a performance penalty, but I think we shouldn't use performance as a way to measure usefulness of a fuzz tests. The fastest fuzz test is the one that tests nothing. However, it is also the most useless one. Anything that can be solved by letting the fuzz engine run for another hour or by simply adding one more core should not be a reason to cripple the test into one that yields less coverage.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this has shown to be effective in the past. Take for example the process_message harness vs the process_message*s* harness. The latter is allowed to send an arbitrary number of messages and start an arbitrary number of peers. The latter (more flexible and broader) test that gives the engine more freedom is also the *only* test that has found bugs in pull requests that none of the other fuzz test or unit test or even functional tests have found. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* It found a nullptr dereference: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18808#discussion_r417307258\r\n* It found an unidentified problem: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15197#pullrequestreview-408731734\r\n* Some more that I am missing...?",

I guess the question boils down to if and to what extent the guidance provided by failing early is meaningful for the fuzzer :)\r\n\r\nCode if anyone wants to experiment: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...practicalswift:consume",

Does that sound like a fair experimental setup that could guide us regarding the trade-offs we're facing here? If so, I'll do it :)",
