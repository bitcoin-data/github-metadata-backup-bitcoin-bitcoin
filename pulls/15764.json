    "body": "Introducing the wallet of the glorious future: native descriptor wallets. With native descriptor wallet, addresses are generated from descriptors. Instead of generating keys and deriving addresses from keys, addresses come from the scriptPubKeys produced by a descriptor.\r\n\r\nDescriptor wallets will now store only keys, keymetadata, and descriptors. Keys are derived from descriptors but those keys are also stored in order to make signing work faster and be less complicated. In order to allow choosing different address types, 6 descriptors are needed for normal use. There is a pair of primary and change descriptors for each of the 3 address types. With the default keypool size of 1000, each descriptor has 1000 keys and scriptPubKeys pregenerated. This has a side effect of making wallets very large since 6000 keys are generated by default, instead of the current 2000. This can probably be improved in the future as we probably don't need so many addresses for each address type.\r\n\r\nDescriptors can also be imported with a new `importdescriptor` RPC.\r\n\r\nNative descriptor wallets also redefines how ismine and watchonly work. Ismine is changing to the simpler model of \"does this scriptPubKey exist in this wallet\". To facilitate this, all of the scriptPubKeys for all of the descriptors are computed on wallet loading. A scriptPubKey is considered `ISMINE_SPENDABLE` if it appears in the set of scriptPubKeys for the wallet. Because of this ismine change, watchonly is also redefined. A wallet can no longer contains watchonly things and non-watchonly things. Instead wallets are either watchonly (by having private keys disabled) or not. There is no mixing of watchonly and non-watchonly in a wallet. Some tests that relied on watchonly behavior had to be removed (i.e. part of `feature_segwit.py`)\r\n\r\nAdditionally several RPCs related to importing and dumping data from a wallet are incompatible with descriptor wallets. These RPCs (`addmultisigaddress`, `importaddress`, `importpubkey`, `importmulti`, `importprivkey`, and `dumpprivkey`) are disabled for normal use.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis PR is built on #15741 for batched writing to the wallet so `TopUpKeyPool` works faster, and on #15761 for upgrading wallets with a RPC.",

But while I understand the impulse to want to replace old code with new code and drop support for things like creating wallets in the current format, I think the PR could be actually simpler, and users would be better off if this took a more conservative approach and just added descriptor functionality as a new optional feature alongside existing functionality, rather than trying to:\r\n\r\n1. add new descriptor support\r\n2. add an upgrade function\r\n3. replace old code and tests\r\n\r\nall in a single PR. It seems to me if this PR just stuck to (1) and saved (2) and (3) for later followup this would be easier to review, and we would have more opportunity to iterate and hammer out any problems with the new descriptor code and design while leaving existing functionality intact.\r\n\r\nAndrew could correct me if I'm wrong, but I think in practice doing what I'm suggesting wouldn't involve big changes to the PR. Mostly just restoring removed code, and maybe copying and updating existing python tests instead of updating them in place. Or adding --descriptor options to the python tests and running both variants.",

      "body": "Concept ACK on:\r\n* adding a descriptor id (sha256 of the string); alternatively we could also the ID wallet based, in which case a simple auto-increment int could suffice\r\n* the WalletDescriptor class, but:\r\n  * I would drop `range_start` and `range_end` unless there's a good reason for them\r\n  * serialization needs versioning (`CURRENT_VERSION=VERSION_BASIC`)\r\n* a new `importdescriptors` RPC method (as opposed to overloading `importmulti`)\r\n* dumpwallet dumps descriptors\r\n  * individual (labeled) addresses should refer to their descriptor id (or just printed directly after their descriptor)\r\n* `std::map<OutputType, DescriptorID> m_..._descriptors` to track descriptors by output type\r\n   * #15590 (or some variation thereof) would let you check the type upon import\r\n\r\nWe need to track if a descriptor is change / receive, and whether it's active (like the keypool) or archived. This PR handles that with `SetPrimaryDescriptor`, etc. My approach was to add a purpose int to each descriptor `DESCRIPTOR_PURPOSE_[RECEIVE,CHANGE]_[CURRENT,ARCHIVE]`. No strong preference. I would probably rename `Primary` to `Receive` though.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm not a fan of:\r\n* LoadDescriptor expands a descriptor and then throws keys and script into the global wallet (e.g. `AddScriptPubKey`); I prefer if descriptor objects handle their own IsMine stuff.\r\n\r\nTo keep this PR small I suggest, in additon to what @jnewbery summarizes:\r\n* don't add private key support (I do think we should have a WIP PR that adds private key support, to get a rough feel for what needs to happen)",
