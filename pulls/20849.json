    "body": "Previously, when disconnecting a peer with a given address we would\r\ncreate a dummy subnet that contains just 1 address (/32 for IPv4 and\r\n/128 for IPv6) and would disconnect all peers that belong to this\r\nsubnet (there may be more than one connection, to a different port).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that for any non-IPv4 and non-IPv6 address we would\r\ncreate an invalid subnet which would later not match any addresses.\r\n\r\nThus, don't use a one-host-subnet, but compare the addresses directly.\r\nThis works for any type of addresses.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

In two places in the code we expect that once we create such subnet later it will match `foo.onion`: in `CConnman::DisconnectNode()` and in `BanMan`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20849 fixes `DisconnectNode()` by changing it to not use subnets at all (small isolated change, easy to verify it is correct).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20852 changes `CSubNet` to follow the above expected behavior, thus fixing both `DisconnectNode()` and `BanMan` (bigger change, harder to verify it is correct, caused unexpected CI failure (fixed)).\r\n\r\n**About the release, maybe the following makes sense:**\r\n\r\nInclude https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20849 in the next rc and in the `0.21.0` release.\r\n\r\nLater, if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20852 is merged (ever) there is no need to revert https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20849.\r\n",
