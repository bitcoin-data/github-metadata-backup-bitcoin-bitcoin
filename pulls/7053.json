    "body": "This the last part of #5970 that is going to be opened independently,\nsee more details for why in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5970#issuecomment-157688788.\n\nThe main remaining commit in that #5970 was\nhttps://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/8550a273ad04c0b1d1eb518574d85f2e7fba1287\nwhich is lazily leveraging not only previous steps in that PR,\nbut also in the additional work by many people accepting that, given\nthat they were altering the declaration of a function, it was free\nfor them to pass Consensus::Params or CChainParams too. This PR\ncontains that commit plus a few small additions ready to squash or\nleave out.\n\nIt may be disruptive to things we would really like to see in 0.12\nbefore the testing window closes, but I can easily rebase this on\ndemand, even after all the desired changes are merged and right\nbefore forking 0.12 (and I believe it will remain pretty reviewable and\nlow risk). It is likely that after rebase, this becomes more incomplete than it currently is, but better is better.\n",
