This small change allows the Block Index Loading to watch out for a requested exit, and abort during the process.\n\nIt's been tested on my computer so far.\n\nWithout this change: the bitcoin-qt process is unkillable (without a kill -9) during the initial Loading of the Block Index. This goes against standards for processes, which should try to exit cleanly as soon as a kill signal is sent.\n",
