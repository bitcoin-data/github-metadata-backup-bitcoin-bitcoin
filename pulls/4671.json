These two nodes were submitted without any clear evidence of community trust in their organizations and, as such, should either provide such evidence, or be removed.\n\n@ayeowch and @bitkevin were the original submitters of the pull requests which added these nodes. Note that they are both part of projects to add more full nodes to the network, which they can continue to do with or without a DNS Seed.\n\nAlso, blog.open-nodes.org seems to indicate they are running nodes with aggressive outbound connection counts, amounting to attacking the network and replacing diversely-operated nodes with ones they run :(.\n",

This is part of getaddr.bitnodes.io infrastructure sponsored by the Bitcoin Foundation and operated independently by myself. I believe most of the seeders are operated based on sipa's bitcoin seeder (https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder). seed.bitnodes.io is based on a separate Python implementation available from https://github.com/ayeowch/bitnodes/blob/master/seeder.py. Nodes with most common height are selected on random basis and served via NSD authoritative-only DNS server. The seeder is currently hosted on a dedicated server by Hetzner in Germany and has been one of the most healthy according to http://bitcoinstats.com/network/dns-servers/. I'd be happy to provide more evidence if so required in order to continue the operation of the seeder.\n",
