    "body": "When the `validation:block_connected` tracepoint was introduced in 8f37f5c2a562c38c83fc40234ade9c301fc4e685, the connect block duration was passed in microseconds `µs`. By starting to use steady clock in fabf1cdb206e368a9433abf99a5ea2762a5ed2c0 this changed to nanoseconds `ns`. As the test only checked if the duration value is `> 0` as a plausibility check, this went unnoticed. This was detected this when setting up monitoring for block validation time as part of the Great Consensus Cleanup Revival discussion.\r\n\r\nThis change casts the duration explicitly to nanoseconds, updates the documentation, and adds a check for an upper bound to the tracepoint interface tests. The upper bound is quite lax as mining the block takes much longer than connecting the empty test block. It's however able to detect a duration passed in an incorrect unit (1000x off).\r\n\r\nA previous version of this PR casted the duration to microseconds `µs` - however, as the last three major releases have had the duration as nanoseconds (and this went unnoticed), we assume that this is the API now and changeing it back to microseconds would break the API again.
