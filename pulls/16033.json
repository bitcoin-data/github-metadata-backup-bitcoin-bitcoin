This in turn makes the thread-analysis reasoning being based on incorrect premises.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an assertion in the `LockAnnotation` ctor which checks that the guarantees given by us at compile-time are held also in practice (`ifdef DEBUG_LOCKORDER`).\r\n\r\nIssues like the one described in #16028 will be discovered immediately with this PR merged.\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR:\r\n* Move `LockAnnotation` from `threadsafety.h` (imported code) to `sync.h` (our code)\r\n* Move `LockAnnotation` in `wallet_tests` to make it reflect the truth\r\n* Make sure the compile-time locking promises given via `LockAnnotation`:s hold also in practice at runtime (`ifdef DEBUG_LOCKORDER`)\r\n* Rename `LockAnnotation` to `LockAssertion`",
