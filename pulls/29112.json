    "body": "The way that we have configured SQLite to run means that only one database transaction can be open at a time. Typically, each individual read and write operation will be its own transaction that is opened and committed automatically by SQLite. However, sometimes we want these operations to be batched into a multi-statement transaction, so `SQLiteBatch::TxnBegin`, `SQLiteBatch::TxnCommit`, and `SQLiteBatch::TxnAbort` are used to manage the transaction of the database.\r\n\r\nHowever, once a db transaction is begun with one `SQLiteBatch`, any operations performed by another `SQLiteBatch` will also occur within the same transaction. Furthermore, those other `SQLiteBatch`s will not be expecting a transaction to be active, and will abort it once the `SQLiteBatch` is destructed. This is problematic as it will prevent some data from being written, and also cause the `SQLiteBatch` that opened the transaction in the first place to be in an unexpected state and throw an error.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this situation, we need to prevent the multiple batches from writing at the same time. To do so, I've implemented added a `CSemaphore` within `SQLiteDatabase` which will be used by any `SQLiteBatch` trying to do a write operation. `wait()` is called by `TxnBegin`, and at the beginning of `WriteKey`, `EraseKey`, and `ErasePrefix`. `post()` is called in `TxnCommit`, `TxnAbort` and at the end of `WriteKey`, `EraseKey`, and `ErasePrefix`. To avoid deadlocking on ` TxnBegin()` followed by a `WriteKey()`, `SQLiteBatch will now also track whether a transaction is in progress so that it knows whether to use the semaphore.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not a problem for BDB wallets since BDB uses WAL and provides transaction objects that must be used if an operation is to occur within a transaction. Specifically, we either pass a transaction pointer, or a nullptr, to all BDB operations, and this allows for concurrent transactions so it doesn't have this problem.\r\n\r\nFixes #29110",

It looks like we can't have concurrent transactions that try to operate on the same data, at least not without changing the isolation level, and I don't think it's worth the effort to figure that out when we're planning on removing BDB soon anyways. I've taken your test and updated it to just use SQLite.\r\n\r\nI don't think this particular issue is a problem for us however. The fact that it deadlocks in this particular test case is probably a good thing since it means that BDB is handling locking internally. If there were two threads trying to read/write at the same time, BDB would force one thread to wait for the other, as this PR is doing for SQLite. That's the behavior that we want. It's only a deadlock (and test failure) since the test is trying to do the behavior of two threads within one thread.",

I took some of my commits there.\r\n\r\nWith it, the fix for the problem https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29112#pullrequestreview-1821862931 is straightforward. After resetting the database connection, we can release the lock, as closing the connection automatically rolls back the active transaction (see the PR). This ensures isolation across db handlers and will prevent the deadlocks here.\r\n\r\nTo show the end result, created a quick branch merging all the changes: This PR + #29253 + the test shared in [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29112#pullrequestreview-1821862931) (71170998).  See https://github.com/furszy/bitcoin-core/tree/2024_pr29112_with_dangling_txn_fixes. All tests passing there :).\r\n\r\n",

Just holding off because josibake seemed ready to review https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29112#issuecomment-1930372190 and might have more feedback.\r\n\r\nI did leave some comments but they are all minor and can be ignored. I was was also wondering about this in the PR description:\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29112#issue-2047565192\r\n\r\n> To avoid this situation, we need to prevent the multiple batches from writing at the same time. Although SQLite does have facilities for doing that, they require the Write Ahead Log (WAL) mode, which is a feature that we explicitly chose to disable since it spread wallet data to multiple files. As such, we need to be handling the concurrency ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem accurate to me. As long as all the batch objects are sharing a `sqlite3* m_db` pointer and using the same connection to the database, a semaphore or mutex needs to be used to keep their transactions separate. This would be true whether the database is in WAL or journaling mode. Also if each batch object had it's own `sqlite3* m_db` connection, the semaphore should not be needed regardless of the database mode, IIUC.\r\n",

Although SQLite does have facilities for doing that, they require the Write Ahead Log (WAL) mode, which is a feature that we explicitly chose to disable since it spread wallet data to multiple files. As such, we need to be handling the concurrency ourselves.\r\n> \r\n> This doesn't seem accurate to me. As long as all the batch objects are sharing a `sqlite3* m_db` pointer and using the same connection to the database, a semaphore or mutex needs to be used to keep their transactions separate. This would be true whether the database is in WAL or journaling mode. Also if each batch object had it's own `sqlite3* m_db` connection, the semaphore should not be needed regardless of the database mode, IIUC.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I misunderstood the documentation. Dropped the sentence.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nGoing to leave the nits for now.",

The `SQLiteBatch::Close` function is called by the `SQLiteBatch` destructor so it called on every batch object, whether or not is a created a transaction. If a batch object is being destroyed in one thread while a batch object in another thread has an ongoing transaction, the batch object that's being destroyed could see HasActiveTxn return true and abort a transaction it doesn't own.\r\n\r\nWould also suggest adding a comment above this `m_sqlite_semaphore.post()` line to explain it. Maybe // If TxnAbort call failed, it will not have released the semaphore, so release it here to avoid deadlocks on future writes.",
