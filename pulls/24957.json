    "body": "Fixes #23852\r\n\r\nThis allows pruning to work during the `-loadblock` import process.\r\n\r\nAn example use case is where you have a clean set of block files and you want to create a pruned node from them, but you don't want to alter the input set of block files.\r\n\r\n#23852 noted that pruning was not working reliably during the loadblock import process. The reason why the loadblock process was not pruning regularly as it progressed is that the pruning process (`BlockManager::FindFilesToPrune`) checks the tip height of the active chainstate, and `CChainState::ActivateBestChain` was not called (which updates that tip height) in `ThreadImport` until after all the import files were processed.\r\n\r\nAn example bash command line that makes it easy to import a bunch of block files:\r\n```\r\n./src/qt/bitcoin-qt -debug -logthreadnames -datadir=/tmp/btc -prune=550 -loadblock=/readonly/btc/main/blk{00000..00043}.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne interesting side note is that `CChainState::ActivateBestChain` can be called while the import process is running (in the `loadblk` thread) by concurrent network message processing activity in the `msghand` thread. For example, one way to reproduce this easily is with the `getblockfrompeer` RPC (requesting a block with height greater than 100000) run from a node connected to an importing node. There are other ways too, but this is an easy way. I only mention this to explain how the `max_prune_height=225719` log message in the original issue came to occur.",

      "body": "@aureleoules thanks for looking into this. your block files have blocks out of order. it's nothing that you did wrong. it's just that with the `-loadblock` option, there is no unknown-parent tracking like there is with `-reindex`. i forget the historical reason for why that is at the moment. but, that's how it is. for reference:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L885\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L4431-L4439\r\n\r\nThere is a tool to make some block files for testing where the blocks are in order and loadable with `-loadblock` at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/linearize\r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly, another snag you'll come across is that you need to have at least 100,000 blocks for mainnet due to `nPruneAfterHeight` see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/chainparams.cpp#L109\r\n\r\nI'll make a todo item for myself to see how I can make testing this easier via a follow-up comment, and maybe a set of test input block files or something.",

      "body": "@luke-jr Thanks! I just rebased and had to make a small change due to the #16981 updates. Those updates moved the block data read from disk into the code block that is guarded by `cs_main`. I couldn't move my updates for this PR into that code block because `ActivateBestChain` asserts that `cs_main` is not held. So, I brought `pblock` one level back up out of that `cs_main` guarded scope (leaving the read where #16981 moved it) so that I could access it without the lock being held.\r\n\r\n> Should we be doing this check later on when processing out of order successor blocks?\r\n\r\nNo, because `-loadblock` doesn't support the out of order processing, and I don't want to make `-prune` work with `-reindex` for the reasons that I listed at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23852#issuecomment-1104200340",
