    "body": "This PR furthers the P2P message serialization/deserialization abstraction introduced in #16202 and #16562, in preparation for introducing the BIP324 v2 transport (making this part of #27634). However, nothing in this PR is BIP324-specific, and it contains a number of independently useful improvements.\r\n\r\nThe overall idea is to have a single object in every `CNode` (called `m_transport`) that is responsible for converting sent messages to wire bytes, and for converting received wire bytes back to messages, while having as little as possible knowledge about this conversion process in higher-level net code. To accomplish that, there is an abstract `Transport` class with (currently) a single `V1Transport` implementation.\r\n\r\nStructurally, the above is accomplished by:\r\n* Merging the `TransportDeserializer` and `TransportSerializer` classes into a single `Transport` class, which encompasses both the sending and receiving side. For `V1Transport` these two sides are entirely separate, but this assumption doesn't hold for the BIP324 transport where e.g. the sending encryption key depends on the DH key negotiation data received from the other side. Merging the two means a future `V2Transport` can handle all this interaction without callers needing to be aware.\r\n* Removing the assumption that each message is sent using a computed header followed by (unmodified) data bytes. To achieve that, the sending side of `Transport` mirrors what the receiver side does: callers can set a message to be sent, then ask what bytes must be sent out, and then allowing them to transition to the next message.\r\n* Adding internal locks to protect the sending and receiving state of the `V1Transport` implementation. I believe these aren't strictly needed (opinions welcome) as there is no real way to use `Transport` objects in a multi-threaded fashion without some form of external synchronization (e.g. \"get next bytes to send\" isn't meaningful to call from multiple threads at the same time without mechanism to control the order they'll actually get sent). Still, I feel it's cleaner to make the object responsible for its own consistency (as we definitely do not want the entire object to be under a single external GUARDED_BY, as that'd prevent simultaneous sending and receiving).\r\n* Moving the conversion of messages to bytes on the sending side from `PushMessage` to `SocketSendData`, which is needed to deal with the fact that a transport may not immediately be able to send messages.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a refactor, though some commits are. Among the semantic changes are:\r\n* Changing the send buffer pushback mechanism to trigger based on the memory usage of the buffer rather than the amount of bytes to be sent. This is both closer to the desired behavior, and makes the buffering independent from transport details (which is why it's included here).\r\n* When optimistic send is not applicable, the V1 message checksum calculation now runs in the net thread rather than the message handling thread. I believe that's generally an improvement, as the message handling thread is far more computationally bottlenecked already.\r\n* The checksum calculation now runs under the `CNode::cs_vSend` lock, which does mean no two checksum calculations for messages sent to the same node can run in parallel, even if running in separate threads. Despite that limitation, having the checksum for non-optimistic sends moved in the net thread is still an improvement, I believe.\r\n* Statistics for per-message-type sent bytes are now updated when the bytes are actually handed to the OS rather than in `PushMessage`. This is because the actual serialized sizes aren't known until they've gone through the transport object.\r\n\r\nA fuzz test of the entire `V1Transport` is included. More elaborate rationale for each of the changes can be found in the commit messages.",

The same issue seems to apply to the current Bitcoin Core codebase, though I don't know whether it's a frequent issue for us.\r\n\r\nThe core issue is that whenever our optimistic send fails to fully send a message, we do subsequently not even select() for receiving; if it then turns out that sending is not possible either, no progress is made at all. To address this, the solution used in this PR is to still select() for both sending and receiving when an optimistic send fails, but skip receiving if sending succeeded, and (still) doesn't fully drain the send queue.\r\n\r\nThis is a significant reduction in how aggressive the \"receive pushback\" mechanism is, because now it will only mildly push back while sending progress is made; if the other side stops receiving entirely, the pushback disappears. I don't think that's a serious problem though:\r\n* We still have a pushback mechanism at the application buffer level (when the application receive buffer overflows, receiving is paused until messages in the buffer get processed; waiting on our own net_processing thread, not on the remote party).\r\n* There are cases where the existing mechanism is too aggressive; e.g. when the send queue is non-empty, but tiny, and can be sent with a single send() call. In that case, I think we'd prefer to still receive within the same processing loop of the network thread.\r\n",

This option is only added in order to make experimentation possible; I don't expect it will be supported long-term (or should even remain in this PR).\r\n\r\nStill missing features are:\r\n* Support for the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag.\r\n* Automatically trying V2 connections when the service flag is set.\r\n* Retrying downgrade to V1 when attempted outbound V2 connections immediately fail.\r\n* P2P functional tests (only a fuzz test for the transport is included, and a few bitcoind-to-bitcoind functional tests)\r\n\r\nOther than that, support for V2 connections is functionally complete, including:\r\n* Autodetection of incoming V1 connections.\r\n* Garbage, both sending and receiving.\r\n* Short message type IDs, both sending and receiving.\r\n* Ignore packets (receiving only, and untested).\r\n* Session IDs are visible in `getpeerinfo` output (for manual comparison).\r\n",

After this PR, `vSendMsg` is turned into a queue of *messages*, which have not yet been converted to bytes-on-the-wire; this conversion is now handled by `m_transport`, and it's the transport that remembers what/how much has been sent yet.",

This prediction is also tested now, through an `Assume` in the net code directly, and inside the transport simulation fuzz test.\r\n* A lot more comments and documentation.\r\n* More sanity checks in the added fuzz test.",

The issue is \"net: move message serialization from PushMessage to SocketSendData\" changes the data type of `vSendMsg` from bytes-to-be-sent to messages-to-be-sent, and the latter just don't have a known size-on-the-wire (unless an additional API to transports is added for that, or hardcoding the V1 message encoding size rules).

      "body": "It seems confusing and not ideal that a function called `ReceiveMsgFrom` has so much code dealing with the Send part, and also the side effect of flushing the send message buffer, when the goal is just to create a header for `ser_msg` to be able to receive that, but not to send anything. For example, it should be possible to call `ReceiveMsgFrom` in situations where the send buffer has unrelated contents. Maybe it'd be better to just have the relevant code (i.e. the old `prepareForTransport` duplicated here to extract the header instead of changing the send parts of `m_transport`?)",

You're right that duplicating the old `prepareForTransport` here would work, but I feel that's not really the right approach, as it's kind of hiding what's really going on. It'd also be incompatible with a potential future upgrade to using v2 transports inside the affected unit and fuzz tests.\r\n\r\nWhat's really going on is that we're using the CNode's own *sending* infrastructure to construct bytes, which are then fed to the same CNode's *receive* infrastructure. But there is also \"normal\" non-test sending logic (e.g. sending of version/verack automatically) that uses the same sending infrastucture (however, failing as there is no real socket to send anything on). The flushing here was necessary to wipe the non-test messages that enter the same transport.\r\n\r\nI have for now tried to address your concern here by introducing a more explicit `FlushSendBuffer` call, and adding it where necessary to make tests pass, making it clear where and what is being flushed away, however I think the more proper solution would involve:\r\n* Somehow prevent the sending of non-test messages entirely in test connmans (rather that hacking them away after the fact).\r\n* Give the test connman dedicated per-receive-node send transports which are just used for the test messages sent there. That would make it compatible with v2 operation too.\r\n\r\nDoing those things here feel out of scope, though.\r\n\r\n",

Without it, if there were two consecutive `PushMessage` without intervening `SocketSendData`, `vSendMsg` would already have something in it on the second one.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, I think it's more \"obviously correct\" to do the full check here.",

In these cases, we bail out immediately and just leave things in the send queue and transport.\r\n\r\nFurther up, above the `SetMessageToSend` call, I've added:\r\n\r\n> This fails when there is an existing message still being sent.\r\n\r\nwhich in #28196 is extended to say:\r\n\r\n> This fails when there is an existing message still being sent, or (for v2 transports) when the\r\nhandshake has not yet completed.\r\n\r\n",
