    "body": "These are the simple (and hopefully obviously correct) copies that can be moves instead.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30094#issuecomment-2108751842\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, there are hundreds of places where we copy UniValues needlessly. It should be the case that moves are always preferred over copies, so there should be no downside to these changes.\r\n\r\nwillcl-ark, however, noticed that memory usage may increase in some cases. Logically this makes no sense to me. The only plausible explanation imo is that because the moves are faster, more ops/second occur in some cases.\r\n\r\nThis list of moves was obtained by changing the function signatures of the UniValue functions to accept only rvalues, then compiling and fixing them up one by one. There still exist many places where copies are being made. These can/should be fixed up, but weren't done here for the sake of doing the easy ones first.\r\n\r\nI ran these changes through clang-tidy with `performance-move-const-arg` and `bugprone-use-after-move` and no bugs were detected (though that's obviously not to say it can be trusted 100%).\r\n\r\nAs stated above, there are still lots of other less trivial fixups to do after these including:\r\n- Using non-const UniValues where possible so that moves can happen\r\n- Refactoring code in order to be able to move a UniValue without introducing a use-after-move\r\n- Refactoring functions to accept UniValues by value rather than by const reference",

I didn't check exhaustively, though, since that would be a lot more work and I think we have a clang-tidy check that would catch those cases.",

UniValue copies are reasonable in many cases, but our use of them often lends itself to moving. So we can't detect and disable copies as a rule, and (I assume) if clang-tidy could detect and suggest possible moves as optimizations, it would be offering a generic version of that already.\r\n\r\nHere's an upstream discussion about it that has apparently gone stale: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/53489",

      "body": "> Could this be a case for a clang-tidy plugin?\r\n\r\nI think the ideal thing to do for types that are potentially expensive to copy is to disable implicit copies, but provide explicit `T Copy() const` and `void CopyFrom(const T&)` methods so copies can be made where needed. (There was a `DISABLE_IMPLICIT_COPIES` macro proposed in #24641 that tried to do this, but it didn't seem possible to generalize the implementation so we never added it.) It think it would be probably be reasonable to allow univalue to be explicitly but not implicitly copied, but I'm sure @theuni would have a better intuition.",

In all screenshots **this PR is on the right hand side**:\r\n\r\nWe can see here this PR made 96m allocations, vs 137m, a strict improvement?\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-131022](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/158b4f0d-2509-498c-b9d6-857b86c44570)\r\n\r\nThe unnecessary calls to allocator functions are clearly gotten rid of:\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-131039](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/731fdcec-bdb5-423d-aa60-4ae7a3529b3c)\r\n\r\nHowever despite that total resource usage increases, albeit only a little, ~10MB (also see first image) :\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-131046](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/a120b44e-8db7-42e4-b61b-03740f7f1893)\r\n\r\n![easy-univalue-moves-comparison](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/c89ab584-536f-4086-9e92-a0de07d81562)\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR which affect this test (since #30094) are in [core_write.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30115/files#diff-48fa743e653b0ceebb1e454766c5a2e70981a44503eca6adf24895016db9eb26)\r\n\r\nI guess this may just be allocator stuff I might never get to the bottom of, but I will continue to investigate this for a little bit before bringing a full ACK back :)\r\n\r\nFWIW these changes **did** provide a measurable speedup on my test, roughly of this order:\r\n\r\n- this PR: ~ 1:43\r\n- master: ~ 1:55\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI also see similar result just fetching a single block (in this case block 800,000). Many fewer allocations, but larger total usage:\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-134351](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/24721337-4151-4693-8789-6661115f32e1)\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-134513](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/cf711912-bd96-4de5-ab9f-56ef8aab720f)\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the clues may lie in here, but I am too dumb to know what they are. For some reason after this PR a second ~30MB allocation is made. Without this PR there are 37.2MB and 24.0MB allocations made,, and with this PR those are 38.2MB and 30.9MB, and I don't understand why:\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20240517-135346](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/9a471ba8-254b-4b6c-bde8-458c431e4ab8)\r\n\r\nheaptrack dumps in case anyone else wants to take a look:\r\n\r\n[heaptrack_dumps.zip](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/15349481/heaptrack_dumps.zip)\r\n\r\n",

I agree benchmarks showing increased peak memory usage and RSS are surprising, but number of allocations is down as expected, and runtime is also decreased.\r\n\r\nThe fact that \"peak allocations\" appear to be larger after the change seems interesting. Before the change, the largest allocations are 38.4MB, 26.7MB, and 8.4MB, but after the change they are 39.4MB, 33.7MB, and 10.8MB. I'm not sure what could account for this though. \r\n\r\nIn general, it seems like using std::move could increase memory usage with vectors, because if you std::move into a vector, the new vector has the same [capacity](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/capacity) as the existing vector, but when you copy into a vector, the library could choose a smaller capacity just matching the size, and overall memory usage would be lower after the first vector is destroyed.",

      "body": "> @ryanofsky If you theory is correct, then having a way to invoke `shrink_to_fit` on `UniValue`'s internal vector might be useful.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is ideal. UniValue is a recursive structure, so calling it on the top level vector only shouldn't cause any difference? Similarly, if shirking is done recursively, the runtime overhead will be equal to that of a copy, so might as well just do a copy instead? Finally, whenever a `UniValue` would be ready to shrink, it is usually one step away from being deleted completely anyway. The only missing step is to call `write()` on it to convert it to bytes to send on the wire. However that leads to an alternative, where a new write_and_destroy function is added, which recursively shrinks (deletes) the UniValue as soon as it was written to the stream. From a runtime-overhead this should be free (as the univalue is destroyed afterward anyway). I haven't tested or implemented this, but this may be a start:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>diff</summary>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/common/args.cpp b/src/common/args.cpp\r\nindex c90eb0c685..e66f18277d 100644\r\n--- a/src/common/args.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/common/args.cpp\r\n@@ -248,7 +248,7 @@ bool ArgsManager::ParseParameters(int argc, const char* const argv[], std::strin\r\n         const common::SettingsSpan values{*includes};\r\n         // Range may be empty if -noincludeconf was passed\r\n         if (!values.empty()) {\r\n-            error = \"-includeconf cannot be used from commandline; -includeconf=\" + values.begin()->write();\r\n+            error = \"-includeconf cannot be used from commandline; -includeconf=\" /*+ values.begin()->write_const()*/;\r\n             return false; // pick first value as example\r\n         }\r\n     }\r\n@@ -811,7 +811,7 @@ void ArgsManager::logArgsPrefix(\r\n         for (const auto& value : arg.second) {\r\n             std::optional<unsigned int> flags = GetArgFlags('-' + arg.first);\r\n             if (flags) {\r\n-                std::string value_str = (*flags & SENSITIVE) ? \"****\" : value.write();\r\n+                std::string value_str = (*flags & SENSITIVE) ? \"****\" : \"\"/*value.write_const()*/;\r\n                 LogPrintf(\"%s %s%s=%s\\n\", prefix, section_str, arg.first, value_str);\r\n             }\r\n         }\r\n@@ -825,7 +825,7 @@ void ArgsManager::LogArgs() const\r\n         logArgsPrefix(\"Config file arg:\", section.first, section.second);\r\n     }\r\n     for (const auto& setting : m_settings.rw_settings) {\r\n-        LogPrintf(\"Setting file arg: %s = %s\\n\", setting.first, setting.second.write());\r\n+        LogPrintf(\"Setting file arg: %s = %s\\n\", setting.first, \"\"/*setting.second.write_const()*/);\r\n     }\r\n     logArgsPrefix(\"Command-line arg:\", \"\", m_settings.command_line_options);\r\n }\r\ndiff --git a/src/common/settings.cpp b/src/common/settings.cpp\r\nindex c1520dacd2..268ab39f1e 100644\r\n--- a/src/common/settings.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/common/settings.cpp\r\n@@ -99,7 +99,7 @@ bool ReadSettings(const fs::path& path, std::map<std::string, SettingsValue>& va\r\n     file.close(); // Done with file descriptor.

In the order of single digit percentage points. And, this excess does not appear to grow over time.\r\n\r\nTherefore in my opinion this effect, where it's measurable/noticable at all, is more than offset by the reduced number of allocations (e.g. I've seen 106,000,000 allocations being reduced to 60,000,000 in larger tests using e.g. `blockToJSON`), and the speedups shown using @theuni's benchmark.",

As a result, this simplifies the `kernel::Notifications` interface.\r\n- removes warnings.cpp from the kernel library\r\n- removes warning globals\r\n- adds testing for the warning logic\r\n\r\nBehaviour change introduced:\r\n- the `-alertnotify` command is executed for all `KernelNotifications::warningSet` calls, which now also covers the `large-work-invalid-chain` warning\r\n- the GUI is updated automatically whenever a warning is (un)set, covering some code paths where it previously wouldn't be, e.g. when `node::AbortNode()` is called, or for the `large-work-invalid-chain` warning\r\n\r\nSome discussion points:\r\n- is `const std::string& id` the best way to refer to warnings? Enums are an obvious alternative, but since we need to define warnings across libraries, strings seem like a straightforward solution.",
