    "body": "The current sample systemd script sets 0710 permissions on `/etc/bitcoin` which means it can only be read by the owner. If `/etc/bitcoin` does not exist when the systemd script is run for the first time then the directory gets created with `root` as the owner. The 0710 permissions will/may prevent a non-root user from being able to list the directory (on Ubuntu 18.04 the file can be listed but the permissions are inaccessible).\r\n\r\nEven after copying `bitcoin.conf` to `/etc/bitcoin` it will remain unusable until either the directory permissions are changed or the service user is made the owner.\r\n\r\nThis PR adjusts the permissions that the service script will set on `/etc/bitcoin` so that all users can read and list the default config directory. A user will still have to copy the bitcoin.conf file to it but the adjustment will avoid them having to manually set permissions or change ownership of `/etc/bitcoin`.\r\n\r\nIn addition the `ProtectHome` option has been added. The rationale being if using a service to run bitcoind it's more likely to be a headless daemon that should not need access to user home directories.\r\n\r\nBest link I found for systemd [options].(https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#ConfigurationDirectory=)",

Why is this an issue?\r\n\r\nIt's now happened to me a couple of times where I've installed the service script and overlooked creating the config file. I then check the log messages realise it's missing and copy it into the `/etc/bitcoin` directory. This is where the problem occurs. Restarting the bitcoin service will continue to fail because the permissions on `/etc/bitcoin` are incorrect.\r\n\r\n> 2019-05-11T07:25:52Z\r\n>\r\n> ************************\r\n> EXCEPTION: N5boost10filesystem16filesystem_errorE\r\n> boost::filesystem::status: Permission denied: \"/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\"\r\n> bitcoin in AppInit()\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem the ownership of `/etc/bitcoin` has to be changed to the user the service is running as. Unlike the `StateDirectory` directory the ownership of the `ConfigurationDirectoryMode`  does not get updated automatically by systemd, from the [systemd reference]:(https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#ConfigurationDirectory=):\r\n\r\n> Except in case of ConfigurationDirectory=, the innermost specified directories will be owned by the user and group specified in User= and Group=. If the specified directories already exist and their owning user or group do not match the configured ones, all files and directories below the specified directories as well as the directories themselves will have their file ownership recursively changed to match what is configured.\r\n\r\nAnother possible fix would be to remove the `ConfigurationDirectoryMode` directory from the script. That way at least the service script won't create it with incorrect permissions and it will be left up to the user to do so as they see fit, most likely with themselves as the owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Concept NACK.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. If the `/etc/bitcoin` directory was created by `systemd` with `root` ownership and `0755` permissions, the just created `bitcoin.conf` file (e.g., `touch /etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`) will acquire the same permissions. It means `bitcoin.conf` will be readable for all users.\r\n\r\n2. This PR looks like a bad trade-off between first-time setup convenience for long-term security.\r\n\r\n3. [The best practice](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/init.md) is:\r\n> The configuration file, PID directory (if applicable) and data directory should all be owned by the bitcoin user and group. It is advised for security reasons to make the configuration file and data directory only readable by the bitcoin user and group. Access to bitcoin-cli and other bitcoind rpc clients can then be controlled by group membership.\r\n\r\n@sipsorcery \r\n> the PR doesn't affect the permissions on the bitcoin.conf file.\r\n\r\nYes, it does. It affects the permissions on the `bitcoin.conf` file indirectly as described above.",

That could certainly be a wrong assumption.\r\n\r\nThis is the error that occurs if I take the same steps I've use to set up dozens of systemd services on Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n````\r\n~$ tail /var/lib/bitcoind/debug.log -f\r\n2019-07-05T18:43:54Z Using data directory /var/lib/bitcoind\r\n2019-07-05T18:43:54Z\r\n\r\n************************\r\nEXCEPTION: N5boost10filesystem16filesystem_errorE\r\nboost::filesystem::status: Permission denied: \"/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\"\r\nbitcoin in AppInit()\r\n\r\n2019-07-05T18:43:54Z Shutdown: In progress...\r\n2019-07-05T18:43:54Z Shutdown: done\r\n````\r\n\r\n@hebasto You are right*. \r\n*Unless the `bitcoin.conf` file already exists with the correct ownership.

On the one hand I see the problem with having the config file world-readable due to RPC secrets; on the other hand, if one wants to run with the default settings and doesn't care about putting a `bitcoin.conf` in `/etc/bitcoin` the current systemd service file simply creates the the directory with the wrong permissions. I think @ryanofsky's `chgrp` suggestion is the best of both worlds, will experiment with that and update my PR if it works.",

Without `-conf=/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`, `bitcoind` would default to iiuc `$HOME/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` (with `$HOME` set by the `bitcoin` user), preventing further hardening measures such as `ProtectHome=true` (assuming the `bitcoin` user's home dir is `/home/bitcoin`).\r\n\r\n> 3. The best practice is:\r\n> `The configuration file, PID directory (if applicable) and data directory should all be owned by the bitcoin user and group. It is advised for security reasons to make the configuration file and data directory only readable by the bitcoin user and group. Access to bitcoin-cli and other bitcoind rpc clients can then be controlled by group membership.`\r\n\r\nThis looks like it might also need fixing; there is no point to separating the config file out from the writeable datadir if you are going to make the config dir writeable by the user executing the service; making the config file readable but not writeable by the user executing the service is the whole point of having separate data- and config dirs; this is also why systemd does not `chown` the `ConfigurationDirectory` to the `User` and `Group` specified in the service file.",
