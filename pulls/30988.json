    "body": "Currently `CConnman` is a mixture of:\r\n* low level socket handling, e.g. send, recv, poll, bind, listen, connect, and\r\n* higher level logic that is specific to the Bitcoin P2P protocol, e.g. V1/V2 transport, choosing which address to connect to, if we manage to connect mark the address good in `AddrMan`, maintaining the number of inbound and outbound connections, banning of peers, interacting with `PeerManager`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the socket handling into a new class which makes the code more modular and reusable. Having more modular and reusable code is a good thing on its own, even if the code is not reused. Stratum V2 and libevent-less RPC/HTTP server could benefit from this, but it makes sense on its own, even without those projects.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe socket operations are driven by the new class `SockMan` which informs the higher level via provided methods when e.g. new data arrives on the socket or a new connection is accepted. For this, `SockMan` provides some non-virtual methods to start it rolling and then it calls pure virtual methods which are implemented by the higher level (e.g. `CConnman`) on certain events, for example \"got this new data on this node's socket\".\r\n\r\nThe public interface of `SockMan` is:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n/**\r\n * A socket manager class which handles socket operations.\r\n * To use this class, inherit from it and implement the pure virtual methods.\r\n * Handled operations:\r\n * - binding and listening on sockets\r\n * - starting of necessary threads to process socket operations\r\n * - accepting incoming connections\r\n * - making outbound connections\r\n * - closing connections\r\n * - waiting for IO readiness on sockets and doing send/recv accordingly\r\n */\r\nclass SockMan\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n\r\n    //\r\n    // Non-virtual functions, to be reused by children classes.\r\n    //\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Bind to a new address:port, start listening and add the listen socket to `m_listen`.\r\n     * Should be called before `StartSocketsThreads()`.\r\n     * @param[in] to Where to bind.\r\n     * @param[out] errmsg Error string if an error occurs.\r\n     * @retval true Success.\r\n     * @retval false Failure, `strError` will be set.\r\n     */\r\n    bool BindAndStartListening(const CService& to, bilingual_str& errmsg);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Start the necessary threads for sockets IO.\r\n     */\r\n    void StartSocketsThreads(const Options& options);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Join (wait for) the threads started by `StartSocketsThreads()` to exit.\r\n     */\r\n    void JoinSocketsThreads();\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Make an outbound connection, save the socket internally and return a newly generated node id.\r\n     * @param[in] to The address to connect to, either as CService or a host as string and port as\r\n     * an integer, if the later is used, then `proxy` must be valid.\r\n     * @param[in] is_important If true, then log failures with higher severity.\r\n     * @param[in] proxy Proxy to connect through if `proxy.IsValid()` is true.\r\n     * @param[out] proxy_failed If `proxy` is valid and the connection failed because of the\r\n     * proxy, then it will be set to true.\r\n     * @param[out] me If the connection was successful then this is set to the address on the\r\n     * local side of the socket.\r\n     * @return Newly generated node id, or std::nullopt if the operation fails.\r\n     */\r\n    std::optional<NodeId> ConnectAndMakeNodeId(const std::variant<CService, StringHostIntPort>& to,\r\n                                               bool is_important,\r\n                                               const Proxy& proxy,\r\n                                               bool& proxy_failed,\r\n                                               CService& me);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Disconnect a given peer by closing its socket and release resources occupied by it.\r\n     * @return Whether the peer existed and its socket was closed by this call.\r\n     */\r\n    bool CloseConnection(NodeId node_id);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Try to send some data to the given node.\r\n     * @param[in] node_id Identifier of the node to send to.\r\n     * @param[in] data The data to send, it might happen that only a prefix of this is sent.\r\n     * @param[in] will_send_more Used as an optimization if the caller knows that they will\r\n     * be sending more data soon after this call.\r\n     * @param[out] errmsg If <0 is returned then this will contain a human readable message\r\n     * explaining the error.\r\n     * @retval >=0 The number of bytes actually sent.\r\n     * @retval <0 A permanent error has occurred.\r\n     */\r\n    ssize_t SendBytes(NodeId node_id,\r\n                      Span<const unsigned char> data,\r\n                      bool will_send_more,\r\n                      std::string& errmsg) const;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Close all sockets.\r\n     */\r\n    void CloseSockets();\r\n\r\n    //\r\n    // Pure virtual functions must be implemented by children classes.\r\n    //\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Be notified when a new connection has been accepted.\r\n     * @param[in] node_id Id of the newly accepted connection.\r\n     * @param[in] me The address and port at our side of the connection.\r\n     * @param[in] them The address and port at the peer's side of the connection.\r\n     * @retval true The new connection was accepted at the higher level.\r\n     * @retval false The connection was refused at the higher level, so the\r\n     * associated socket and node_id should be discarded by `SockMan`.\r\n     */\r\n    virtual bool EventNewConnectionAccepted(NodeId node_id,\r\n                                            const CService& me,\r\n                                            const CService& them) = 0;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Called when the socket is ready to send data and `ShouldTryToSend()` has\r\n     * returned true.

Really the only thing HTTP needs it for is `walletpassphrase` which calls `RPCRunLater()` which interacts with `HTTPRPCTimerInterface()`. I don't think Conman has a specific mechanism for this because timed things are attached directly to nodes like `m_last_getheaders_timestamp` etc. The current `HTTPRPCTimerInterface` uses libevent `event_new()`  and `evtimer_add()`, I accomplish this with a map of timestamps and callback functions in my event loop: https://github.com/pinheadmz/bitcoin/commit/42b7240378ffc4890ab4ba1453623e5986ea2a71",

Maybe the scheduler, like @maflcko suggested, or in the `EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers()` method which will be called periodically by `SockMan`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n    /**\r\n     * SockMan has completed send+recv for all nodes.\r\n     * Can be used to execute periodic tasks for all nodes.\r\n     * The implementation in SockMan does nothing.\r\n     */\r\n    virtual void EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers();\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: I guess `TriggerEvents()` from https://github.com/pinheadmz/bitcoin/commit/42b7240378ffc4890ab4ba1453623e5986ea2a71 can be called from `EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers()` or from the scheduler.",

However it would make this PR larger. I will leave it off for now. There is some specific `CNode` ref-counting in `CConnman` and the code around deleting a node is a bit complicated, so it would require further non-trivial changes to move that to `SockMan`.\r\n\r\nI think in general, in the long term, independently of this PR, it would be good to get rid of the manual `CNode` ref-counting and tap `std::shared_ptr` to do that for us. In other words, to revive https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28222.",

The call to `send()` returns the total amount of bytes immediately, but it requires 60-70 TCP packets to actually transmit the response. I think what I'm seeing in wireshark is that this transmission is incomplete when I close the HTTP connection with `CloseConnection()` which closes the underlying socket. The client waits 120 seconds for the rest of its data which never arrives before timing out. I'm not sure if there's a flag in one of the syscalls or another way to check the kernel's socket buffer before closing?\r\n",

But I am leaving this as it is because it is like that in `master` and this PR only moves it from `net.cpp` to `sockman.cpp` verbatim. I hope it is easier to reviewers to just check that a blob of code is moved without having to validate its correctness since that same code is already in `master`.

      "body": "I might be misunderstanding `cancel_recv`, in my HTTP server I set it to `true` when I'm planning on disconnecting a node like if there was an error sending data or if `\"Connection: close\"` is set. However this causes weird behavior where new connections get hung up forever. In particular, `interface_rpc.py` stalls on the ultimate node shutdown and eventually times out after 120 seconds of rpc `stop` not working. When I set `cancel_recv=false` everywhere, i don't have this issue.

It does not do anything about I2P connections that are already established. `ThreadSocketHandler` does both accepting new connections and doing send/recv on existent connections.\r\n\r\nYes, your observation is correct. Listening can fail temporary, e.g. if the I2P router daemon is restarted. This is unlike the TCP listening where once `bind()` and `listen()` succeed, then we are listening until we decide to close the socket. Tor is like I2P - it can fail to listen for a while if the Tor daemon is restarted. Our Tor code has the deficiency that it does not handle that, so it would act as if we are listening (e.g. advertising our Tor address) even if we are not listening.\r\n\r\nCurrent `EventI2PListen` vs `EventI2PConnectivity` - I think \"Connectivity\" would be too broad because this method is only called in the event where we start or stop listening for incoming I2P connections. It is not related to whether we have existent I2P connections or to our ability to make new outgoing I2P connections which \"Connectivity\" would imply.",

So that `cancel_recv` is set in all code paths inside `HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend()`.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- i/src/httpserver.cpp\r\n+++ w/src/httpserver.cpp\r\n@@ -1123,12 +1123,15 @@ bool HTTPServer::EventNewConnectionAccepted(NodeId node_id,\r\n     m_connected_clients.emplace(client->m_node_id, std::move(client));\r\n     return true;\r\n }\r\n \r\n void HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend(NodeId node_id, bool& cancel_recv)\r\n {\r\n+    // Next attempt to receive data from this node is permitted\r\n+    cancel_recv = false;\r\n+\r\n     // Get the HTTPClient\r\n     auto client{WITH_LOCK(m_clients_mutex, return GetClientById(node_id);)};\r\n     if (client == nullptr) {\r\n         return;\r\n     }\r\n \r\n@@ -1149,26 +1152,26 @@ void HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend(NodeId node_id, bool& cancel_recv)\r\n             LogDebug(\r\n                 BCLog::HTTP,\r\n                 \"Error sending HTTP response headers to client %s (id=%lld): %s\\n\",\r\n                 client->m_origin,\r\n                 client->m_node_id,\r\n                 err);\r\n-            cancel_recv = false;\r\n+            cancel_recv = true;\r\n             client->m_disconnect = true;\r\n             return;\r\n         }\r\n \r\n         ssize_t body_bytes_sent = SendBytes(node_id, MakeUCharSpan(res.m_body), /*will_send_more=*/true, err);\r\n         if (body_bytes_sent < 0) {\r\n             LogDebug(\r\n                 BCLog::HTTP,\r\n                 \"Error sending HTTP response body to client %s (id=%lld): %s\\n\",\r\n                 client->m_origin,\r\n                 client->m_node_id,\r\n                 err);\r\n-            cancel_recv = false;\r\n+            cancel_recv = true;\r\n             client->m_disconnect = true;\r\n             return;\r\n         }\r\n \r\n         LogDebug(\r\n             BCLog::HTTP,\r\n@@ -1176,20 +1179,17 @@ void HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend(NodeId node_id, bool& cancel_recv)\r\n             hdr_bytes_sent + body_bytes_sent,\r\n             client->m_origin,\r\n             client->m_node_id);\r\n \r\n         // Our work is done here\r\n         if (!res.m_keep_alive) {\r\n-            cancel_recv = false;\r\n+            cancel_recv = true;\r\n             client->m_disconnect = true;\r\n             return;\r\n         }\r\n     }\r\n-\r\n-    // Next attempt to receive data from this node is permitted\r\n-    cancel_recv = false;\r\n }\r\n \r\n void HTTPServer::EventGotData(NodeId node_id, const uint8_t* data, size_t n)\r\n {\r\n     // Get the HTTPClient\r\n     auto client{WITH_LOCK(m_clients_mutex, return GetClientById(node_id);)};\r\n```",

One would just set the flag and the other would also release the socket reference. My idea was to have both of them require a `reason`-argument and an optional `BCLog::Level`-argument. They would log internally if `fDisconnect` was not already set, instead of having every call site log. `MarkAsDisconnectAndCloseConnection`, seems like an opportunity to do such a thing.\r\n\r\n[WIP disconnecting++ branch](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...hodlinator:bitcoin:2025/01/disconnecting++)\r\n\r\nTotally fine with considering it out of scope for this PR.\r\n```suggestion\r\n                MarkAsDisconnectAndCloseConnection(node, \"socket send error: %s\", err_msg);\r\n```\r\n",

This stays unchanged as peers connect and disconnect. We would want to remove entries from those maps if we stop listening - i.e. if we close the listening socket. This is only done at shutdown.",

Because of that, this code is equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstd::pair<NodeId, std::chrono::seconds> youngest_peer{-1, 0}, next_youngest_peer{-1, 0};\r\n\r\nm_connman.ForEachNode([&](CNode* pnode) {\r\n    if (!pnode->IsBlockOnlyConn() || pnode->fDisconnect) return;\r\n    next_youngest_peer = youngest_peer;\r\n    youngest_peer.first = pnode->GetId();\r\n    youngest_peer.second = pnode->m_last_block_time;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new code will again select the two youngest peers (the two with the bigger `id`s), but does not require that the iterating is in increasing order of `id`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstd::pair<NodeId, std::chrono::seconds> youngest_peer{-1, 0}, next_youngest_peer{-1, 0};\r\n\r\nm_connman.ForEachNode([&](CNode* pnode) {\r\n    if (!pnode->IsBlockOnlyConn() || pnode->fDisconnect) return;\r\n    if (pnode->GetId() > next_youngest_peer.first) {\r\n        if (pnode->GetId() > youngest_peer.first) {\r\n            next_youngest_peer = youngest_peer;\r\n            youngest_peer.first = pnode->GetId();\r\n            youngest_peer.second = pnode->m_last_block_time;\r\n        } else {  \r\n            next_youngest_peer.first = pnode->GetId();\r\n            next_youngest_peer.second = pnode->m_last_block_time;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```",

It is nice that the check is done at compile time, but if the compiler is not clang then it will be ignored, or if the compiler is clang but is running without `-Werror`, then it will only result in a compile warning which is likely to be missed in the build output. In other words, it is possible to create a violating code and compile and run it with both gcc and clang. In that case `AssertLockNotHeld()` will stop the program at runtime.",

From all callers of `MarkAsDisconnectAndCloseConnection()`:\r\n\r\n* 3 unconditional `LogDebug(BCLog::NET`\r\n* 1 no log\r\n* 2 conditional `LogDebug(BCLog::NET` based on `fDisconnect`\r\n\r\nSo it is not like all the callers do the same thing. Maybe it is ok to consolidate those into one behavior, but would be a functional change that is not the purpose of this PR. Leaving it as it is, but sounds like something to explore as a followup.",
