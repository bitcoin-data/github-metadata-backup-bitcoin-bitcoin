    "body": "Currently `CConnman` is a mixture of:\r\n* low level socket handling, e.g. send, recv, poll, bind, listen, connect, and\r\n* higher level logic that is specific to the Bitcoin P2P protocol, e.g. V1/V2 transport, choosing which address to connect to, if we manage to connect mark the address good in `AddrMan`, maintaining the number of inbound and outbound connections, banning of peers, interacting with `PeerManager`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the socket handling into a new class which makes the code more modular and reusable. Having more modular and reusable code is a good thing on its own, even if the code is not reused. Stratum V2 and libevent-less RPC/HTTP server could benefit from this, but it makes sense on its own, even without those projects.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe socket operations are driven by the new class `SockMan` which informs the higher level via provided methods when e.g. new data arrives on the socket or a new connection is accepted. For this, `SockMan` provides some non-virtual methods to start it rolling and then it calls pure virtual methods which are implemented by the higher level (e.g. `CConnman`) on certain events, for example \"got this new data on this node's socket\".\r\n\r\nThe public interface of `SockMan` is:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n/**\r\n * A socket manager class which handles socket operations.\r\n * To use this class, inherit from it and implement the pure virtual methods.\r\n * Handled operations:\r\n * - binding and listening on sockets\r\n * - starting of necessary threads to process socket operations\r\n * - accepting incoming connections\r\n * - making outbound connections\r\n * - closing connections\r\n * - waiting for IO readiness on sockets and doing send/recv accordingly\r\n */\r\nclass SockMan\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n\r\n    //\r\n    // Non-virtual functions, to be reused by children classes.\r\n    //\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Bind to a new address:port, start listening and add the listen socket to `m_listen`.\r\n     * Should be called before `StartSocketsThreads()`.\r\n     * @param[in] to Where to bind.\r\n     * @param[out] errmsg Error string if an error occurs.\r\n     * @retval true Success.\r\n     * @retval false Failure, `strError` will be set.\r\n     */\r\n    bool BindAndStartListening(const CService& to, bilingual_str& errmsg);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Start the necessary threads for sockets IO.\r\n     */\r\n    void StartSocketsThreads(const Options& options);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Join (wait for) the threads started by `StartSocketsThreads()` to exit.\r\n     */\r\n    void JoinSocketsThreads();\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Make an outbound connection, save the socket internally and return a newly generated node id.\r\n     * @param[in] to The address to connect to, either as CService or a host as string and port as\r\n     * an integer, if the later is used, then `proxy` must be valid.\r\n     * @param[in] is_important If true, then log failures with higher severity.\r\n     * @param[in] proxy Proxy to connect through if `proxy.IsValid()` is true.\r\n     * @param[out] proxy_failed If `proxy` is valid and the connection failed because of the\r\n     * proxy, then it will be set to true.\r\n     * @param[out] me If the connection was successful then this is set to the address on the\r\n     * local side of the socket.\r\n     * @return Newly generated node id, or std::nullopt if the operation fails.\r\n     */\r\n    std::optional<NodeId> ConnectAndMakeNodeId(const std::variant<CService, StringHostIntPort>& to,\r\n                                               bool is_important,\r\n                                               const Proxy& proxy,\r\n                                               bool& proxy_failed,\r\n                                               CService& me);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Disconnect a given peer by closing its socket and release resources occupied by it.\r\n     * @return Whether the peer existed and its socket was closed by this call.\r\n     */\r\n    bool CloseConnection(NodeId node_id);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Try to send some data to the given node.\r\n     * @param[in] node_id Identifier of the node to send to.\r\n     * @param[in] data The data to send, it might happen that only a prefix of this is sent.\r\n     * @param[in] will_send_more Used as an optimization if the caller knows that they will\r\n     * be sending more data soon after this call.\r\n     * @param[out] errmsg If <0 is returned then this will contain a human readable message\r\n     * explaining the error.\r\n     * @retval >=0 The number of bytes actually sent.\r\n     * @retval <0 A permanent error has occurred.\r\n     */\r\n    ssize_t SendBytes(NodeId node_id,\r\n                      Span<const unsigned char> data,\r\n                      bool will_send_more,\r\n                      std::string& errmsg) const;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Close all sockets.\r\n     */\r\n    void CloseSockets();\r\n\r\n    //\r\n    // Pure virtual functions must be implemented by children classes.\r\n    //\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Be notified when a new connection has been accepted.\r\n     * @param[in] node_id Id of the newly accepted connection.\r\n     * @param[in] me The address and port at our side of the connection.\r\n     * @param[in] them The address and port at the peer's side of the connection.\r\n     * @retval true The new connection was accepted at the higher level.\r\n     * @retval false The connection was refused at the higher level, so the\r\n     * associated socket and node_id should be discarded by `SockMan`.\r\n     */\r\n    virtual bool EventNewConnectionAccepted(NodeId node_id,\r\n                                            const CService& me,\r\n                                            const CService& them) = 0;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Called when the socket is ready to send data and `ShouldTryToSend()` has\r\n     * returned true.

Really the only thing HTTP needs it for is `walletpassphrase` which calls `RPCRunLater()` which interacts with `HTTPRPCTimerInterface()`. I don't think Conman has a specific mechanism for this because timed things are attached directly to nodes like `m_last_getheaders_timestamp` etc. The current `HTTPRPCTimerInterface` uses libevent `event_new()`  and `evtimer_add()`, I accomplish this with a map of timestamps and callback functions in my event loop: https://github.com/pinheadmz/bitcoin/commit/42b7240378ffc4890ab4ba1453623e5986ea2a71",

Maybe the scheduler, like @maflcko suggested, or in the `EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers()` method which will be called periodically by `SockMan`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n    /**\r\n     * SockMan has completed send+recv for all nodes.\r\n     * Can be used to execute periodic tasks for all nodes.\r\n     * The implementation in SockMan does nothing.\r\n     */\r\n    virtual void EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers();\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: I guess `TriggerEvents()` from https://github.com/pinheadmz/bitcoin/commit/42b7240378ffc4890ab4ba1453623e5986ea2a71 can be called from `EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers()` or from the scheduler.",
