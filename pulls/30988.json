    "body": "Currently `CConnman` is a mixture of:\r\n* low level socket handling, e.g. send, recv, poll, bind, listen, connect, and\r\n* higher level logic that is specific to the Bitcoin P2P protocol, e.g. V1/V2 transport, choosing which address to connect to, if we manage to connect mark the address good in `AddrMan`, maintaining the number of inbound and outbound connections, banning of peers, interacting with `PeerManager`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the socket handling into a new class which makes the code more modular and reusable. Having more modular and reusable code is a good thing on its own, even if the code is not reused. Stratum V2 and libevent-less RPC/HTTP server could benefit from this, but it makes sense on its own, even without those projects.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe socket operations are driven by the new class `SockMan` which informs the higher level via provided methods when e.g. new data arrives on the socket or a new connection is accepted. For this, `SockMan` provides some non-virtual methods to start it rolling and then it calls pure virtual methods which are implemented by the higher level (e.g. `CConnman`) on certain events, for example \"got this new data on this node's socket\".\r\n\r\nThe interface of `SockMan` is:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n/**\r\n * A socket manager class which handles socket operations.\r\n * To use this class, inherit from it and implement the pure virtual methods.\r\n * Handled operations:\r\n * - binding and listening on sockets\r\n * - starting of necessary threads to process socket operations\r\n * - accepting incoming connections\r\n * - making outbound connections\r\n * - closing connections\r\n * -

Really the only thing HTTP needs it for is `walletpassphrase` which calls `RPCRunLater()` which interacts with `HTTPRPCTimerInterface()`. I don't think Conman has a specific mechanism for this because timed things are attached directly to nodes like `m_last_getheaders_timestamp` etc. The current `HTTPRPCTimerInterface` uses libevent `event_new()`  and `evtimer_add()`, I accomplish this with a map of timestamps and callback functions in my event loop: https://github.com/pinheadmz/bitcoin/commit/42b7240378ffc4890ab4ba1453623e5986ea2a71",

      "body": "@pinheadmz, I think that the functionality of \"execute this code after some time\", is not much related to the sockets handling and better be implemented at some higher level, not inside `SockMan`. Maybe the scheduler, like @maflcko suggested, or in the `EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers()` method which will be called periodically by `SockMan`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n    /**\r\n     * SockMan has completed send+recv for all nodes.\r\n     * Can be used to execute periodic tasks for all nodes.\r\n     * The implementation in SockMan does nothing.\r\n     */\r\n    virtual void EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers();\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: I guess `TriggerEvents()` from https://github.com/pinheadmz/bitcoin/commit/42b7240378ffc4890ab4ba1453623e5986ea2a71 can be called from `EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers()` or from the scheduler.",

However it would make this PR larger. I will leave it off for now. There is some specific `CNode` ref-counting in `CConnman` and the code around deleting a node is a bit complicated, so it would require further non-trivial changes to move that to `SockMan`.\r\n\r\nI think in general, in the long term, independently of this PR, it would be good to get rid of the manual `CNode` ref-counting and tap `std::shared_ptr` to do that for us.

The call to `send()` returns the total amount of bytes immediately, but it requires 60-70 TCP packets to actually transmit the response. I think what I'm seeing in wireshark is that this transmission is incomplete when I close the HTTP connection with `CloseConnection()` which closes the underlying socket. The client waits 120 seconds for the rest of its data which never arrives before timing out. I'm not sure if there's a flag in one of the syscalls or another way to check the kernel's socket buffer before closing?\r\n",

The convention then is to mark this PR draft until that one is merged.\r\n\r\nAdded a note at the bottom of the description of this PR. This PR was not a draft before #31854. The creation of #31854 did not change anything about this PR, so I think the existence of a chop off PR shouldn't render this one as a draft. There is no dependency between the two - either one can be merged first.\r\n\r\n> Additionally, it's 25% easier to review #31854 if you rebase this PR on the exact same commit. Since then I can just range-diff it with what I already reviewed here.\r\n\r\nDone.",

      "body": "I might be misunderstanding `cancel_recv`, in my HTTP server I set it to `true` when I'm planning on disconnecting a node like if there was an error sending data or if `\"Connection: close\"` is set. However this causes weird behavior where new connections get hung up forever. In particular, `interface_rpc.py` stalls on the ultimate node shutdown and eventually times out after 120 seconds of rpc `stop` not working. When I set `cancel_recv=false` everywhere, i don't have this issue. (Still a lot of other issues to clean up in this branch!)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pinheadmz/bitcoin/commit/df1965a4e97ce7f3df067df9b3dcc2bbd8e6e15b",

It does not do anything about I2P connections that are already established. `ThreadSocketHandler` does both accepting new connections and doing send/recv on existent connections.\r\n\r\nYes, your observation is correct. Listening can fail temporary, e.g. if the I2P router daemon is restarted. This is unlike the TCP listening where once `bind()` and `listen()` succeed, then we are listening until we decide to close the socket. Tor is like I2P - it can fail to listen for a while if the Tor daemon is restarted. Our Tor code has the deficiency that it does not handle that, so it would act as if we are listening (e.g. advertising our Tor address) even if we are not listening.\r\n\r\nCurrent `EventI2PListen` vs `EventI2PConnectivity` - I think \"Connectivity\" would be too broad because this method is only called in the event where we start or stop listening for incoming I2P connections. It is not related to whether we have existent I2P connections or to our ability to make new outgoing I2P connections which \"Connectivity\" would imply.",

      "body": "> `@param[out] cancel_recv Should always be set upon return`\r\n\r\nI think the problem was that `HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend()` could end up not setting `cancel_recv` in which case it remains uninitialized, containing a \"random\" value from the stack at the caller (which was probably `true`, so it canceled all receives from the client, never receiving anything causing an infinite loop):\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n              bool cancel_recv;\r\n  \r\n              EventReadyToSend(node_id, cancel_recv);\r\n  \r\n              if (cancel_recv) {\r\n                  recv_ready = false;\r\n              }\r\n```\r\n\r\nValgrind or memory sanitizer should complain about this code reading uninitialized value in `if (cancel_recv)`.\r\n\r\nThe below fixes it, remove the last commit from your branch and move the setting of `cancel_recv` from the bottom to the top of the method. So that `cancel_recv` is set in all code paths inside `HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend()`.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- i/src/httpserver.cpp\r\n+++ w/src/httpserver.cpp\r\n@@ -1123,12 +1123,15 @@ bool HTTPServer::EventNewConnectionAccepted(NodeId node_id,\r\n     m_connected_clients.emplace(client->m_node_id, std::move(client));\r\n     return true;\r\n }\r\n \r\n void HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend(NodeId node_id, bool& cancel_recv)\r\n {\r\n+    // Next attempt to receive data from this node is permitted\r\n+    cancel_recv = false;\r\n+\r\n     // Get the HTTPClient\r\n     auto client{WITH_LOCK(m_clients_mutex, return GetClientById(node_id);)};\r\n     if (client == nullptr) {\r\n         return;\r\n     }\r\n \r\n@@ -1149,26 +1152,26 @@ void HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend(NodeId node_id, bool& cancel_recv)\r\n             LogDebug(\r\n                 BCLog::HTTP,\r\n                 \"Error sending HTTP response headers to client %s (id=%lld): %s\\n\",\r\n                 client->m_origin,\r\n                 client->m_node_id,\r\n                 err);\r\n-            cancel_recv = false;\r\n+            cancel_recv = true;\r\n             client->m_disconnect = true;\r\n             return;\r\n         }\r\n \r\n         ssize_t body_bytes_sent = SendBytes(node_id, MakeUCharSpan(res.m_body), /*will_send_more=*/true, err);\r\n         if (body_bytes_sent < 0) {\r\n             LogDebug(\r\n                 BCLog::HTTP,\r\n                 \"Error sending HTTP response body to client %s (id=%lld): %s\\n\",\r\n                 client->m_origin,\r\n                 client->m_node_id,\r\n                 err);\r\n-            cancel_recv = false;\r\n+            cancel_recv = true;\r\n             client->m_disconnect = true;\r\n             return;\r\n         }\r\n \r\n         LogDebug(\r\n             BCLog::HTTP,\r\n@@ -1176,20 +1179,17 @@ void HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend(NodeId node_id, bool& cancel_recv)\r\n             hdr_bytes_sent + body_bytes_sent,\r\n             client->m_origin,\r\n             client->m_node_id);\r\n \r\n         // Our work is done here\r\n         if (!res.m_keep_alive) {\r\n-            cancel_recv = false;\r\n+            cancel_recv = true;\r\n             client->m_disconnect = true;\r\n             return;\r\n         }\r\n     }\r\n-\r\n-    // Next attempt to receive data from this node is permitted\r\n-    cancel_recv = false;\r\n }\r\n \r\n void HTTPServer::EventGotData(NodeId node_id, const uint8_t* data, size_t n)\r\n {\r\n     // Get the HTTPClient\r\n     auto client{WITH_LOCK(m_clients_mutex, return GetClientById(node_id);)};\r\n```",

One would just set the flag and the other would also release the socket reference. My idea was to have both of them require a `reason`-argument and an optional `BCLog::Level`-argument. They would log internally if `fDisconnect` was not already set, instead of having every call site log. `MarkAsDisconnectAndCloseConnection`, seems like an opportunity to do such a thing.\r\n\r\n[WIP disconnecting++ branch](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...hodlinator:bitcoin:2025/01/disconnecting++)\r\n\r\nTotally fine with considering it out of scope for this PR.\r\n```suggestion\r\n                MarkAsDisconnectAndCloseConnection(node, \"socket send error: %s\", err_msg);\r\n```\r\n",

This stays unchanged as peers connect and disconnect. We would want to remove entries from those maps if we stop listening - i.e. if we close the listening socket. This is only done at shutdown.",

It is nice that the check is done at compile time, but if the compiler is not clang then it will be ignored, or if the compiler is clang but is running without `-Werror`, then it will only result in a compile warning which is likely to be missed in the build output. In other words, it is possible to create a violating code and compile and run it with both gcc and clang. In that case `AssertLockNotHeld()` will stop the program at runtime.",

From all callers of `MarkAsDisconnectAndCloseConnection()`:\r\n\r\n* 3 unconditional `LogDebug(BCLog::NET`\r\n* 1 no log\r\n* 2 conditional `LogDebug(BCLog::NET` based on `fDisconnect`\r\n\r\nSo it is not like all the callers do the same thing. Maybe it is ok to consolidate those into one behavior, but would be a functional change that is not the purpose of this PR. Leaving it as it is, but sounds like something to explore as a followup.",

The logic (as convoluted as it is, it is the same in `master`) is:\r\n\r\n* if connecting to `CService`\r\n  * if to an I2P `CService` then proxy must be used\r\n  * otherwise the proxy is optional, if provided it will be used\r\n* if connecting to string host, then proxy must be used\r\n\r\nSo, if `std::variant` is to be avoided and two functions provided instead of one, then they should be called something like `ConnectToCService()` and `ConnectToString()` :-|\r\n\r\nEdit: or a bunch of functions covering each case:\r\n```cpp\r\nConnectToI2P(CService, proxy); // proxy must be used\r\nConnectDirectly(CService); // no proxy\r\nConnectViaProxy(CService, proxy);\r\nConnectViaProxy(string, proxy); // overload\r\n```",
