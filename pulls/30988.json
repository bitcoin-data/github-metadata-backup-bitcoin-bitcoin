    "body": "Currently `CConnman` is a mixture of:\r\n* low level socket handling, e.g. send, recv, poll, bind, listen, connect, and\r\n* higher level logic that is specific to the Bitcoin P2P protocol, e.g. V1/V2 transport, choosing which address to connect to, if we manage to connect mark the address good in `AddrMan`, maintaining the number of inbound and outbound connections, banning of peers, interacting with `PeerManager`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the socket handling into a new class which makes the code more modular and reusable. Having more modular and reusable code is a good thing on its own, even if the code is not reused. Stratum V2 and libevent-less RPC/HTTP server could benefit from this, but it makes sense on its own, even without those projects.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe socket operations are driven by the new class `SockMan` which informs the higher level via provided methods when e.g. new data arrives on the socket or a new connection is accepted. For this, `SockMan` provides some non-virtual methods to start it rolling and then it calls pure virtual methods which are implemented by the higher level (e.g. `CConnman`) on certain events, for example \"got this new data on this node's socket\".\r\n\r\nThe interface of `SockMan` is:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n/**\r\n * A socket manager class which handles socket operations.\r\n * To use this class, inherit from it and implement the pure virtual methods.\r\n * Handled operations:\r\n * - binding and listening on sockets\r\n * - starting of necessary threads to process socket operations\r\n * - accepting incoming connections\r\n * - making outbound connections\r\n * - closing connections\r\n * -

Really the only thing HTTP needs it for is `walletpassphrase` which calls `RPCRunLater()` which interacts with `HTTPRPCTimerInterface()`. I don't think Conman has a specific mechanism for this because timed things are attached directly to nodes like `m_last_getheaders_timestamp` etc. The current `HTTPRPCTimerInterface` uses libevent `event_new()`  and `evtimer_add()`, I accomplish this with a map of timestamps and callback functions in my event loop: https://github.com/pinheadmz/bitcoin/commit/42b7240378ffc4890ab4ba1453623e5986ea2a71",

      "body": "@pinheadmz, I think that the functionality of \"execute this code after some time\", is not much related to the sockets handling and better be implemented at some higher level, not inside `SockMan`. Maybe the scheduler, like @maflcko suggested, or in the `EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers()` method which will be called periodically by `SockMan`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n    /**\r\n     * SockMan has completed send+recv for all nodes.\r\n     * Can be used to execute periodic tasks for all nodes.\r\n     * The implementation in SockMan does nothing.\r\n     */\r\n    virtual void EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers();\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: I guess `TriggerEvents()` from https://github.com/pinheadmz/bitcoin/commit/42b7240378ffc4890ab4ba1453623e5986ea2a71 can be called from `EventIOLoopCompletedForAllPeers()` or from the scheduler.",

However it would make this PR larger. I will leave it off for now. There is some specific `CNode` ref-counting in `CConnman` and the code around deleting a node is a bit complicated, so it would require further non-trivial changes to move that to `SockMan`.\r\n\r\nI think in general, in the long term, independently of this PR, it would be good to get rid of the manual `CNode` ref-counting and tap `std::shared_ptr` to do that for us.

The call to `send()` returns the total amount of bytes immediately, but it requires 60-70 TCP packets to actually transmit the response. I think what I'm seeing in wireshark is that this transmission is incomplete when I close the HTTP connection with `CloseConnection()` which closes the underlying socket. The client waits 120 seconds for the rest of its data which never arrives before timing out. I'm not sure if there's a flag in one of the syscalls or another way to check the kernel's socket buffer before closing?\r\n",

      "body": "Sorry for waiting to late to chime in on this, but I'm afraid I'm a concept NACK. We discussed this at length at CoreDev, and I'll briefly try to sum up my thoughts:\r\n\r\n- I believe this is the wrong abstraction level. SockMan is essentially mimicking the behavior of a generic io multiplexing framework (libevent, libuv, etc.), but without the feature-set of those libs.\r\n- The internals and api are heavily biased on Core's p2p layer, and aren't well-suited for abstracting. In particular, its event-loop model, send/recv model, and thread model are all particular to Core, and far from state-of-the-art anyway.\r\n- It's not well-suited for the 2 use-cases (that I'm aware of) which use it: an http server and sv2 server. Both would benefit from different from custom socket handling and would actually be _more_ straightforward to implement that way as opposed to building on top of SockMan imo.\r\n- Both of the implementations mentioned above ended up with very non-optimal performance because of the optimistic send, another implementation detail here. This could of course be fixed or worked around, but is an example of the type of problems I would expect to see.\r\n\r\nI've discussed this with both @Sjors and @pinheadmz and have agreed to attempt custom implementations for their use-cases to replace their uses of SockMan. As such, I'd rather not see is abstraction go in.\r\n\r\nAgain, apologies for the delay in commenting :(",

      "body": "@theuni, thanks for looking into this! I find your feedback constructive.\r\n\r\nIf we would have different parts of the code listen for incoming connections, accept them, read and write data to them, then there is bound to be some code duplication in that around the low level sockets handling. `SockMan` aims to handle that code duplication. It is an in-house minimalistic version of a generic IO library, not a feature rich competitor to them. Something like [PCP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30043). Only the minimal stuff that's needed.\r\n\r\nYes, it is biased on Core's P2P layer, because it is extracted from it. If it does not cover some of the needs of Sv2 or HTTP, I am open to tweaking it in any way possible. At the end it should be the intersection of what's needed for P2P, Sv2 and HTTP. If there is no such intersection, then `SockMan` should not exist, but I think that there is.\r\n\r\n> Both would benefit from different from custom socket handling and would actually be _more_ straightforward to implement that way as opposed to building on top of SockMan imo.\r\n\r\nAlright, I am open to that. I would be interested to review. If it would be better, then I do not insist that `SockMan` is used in Sv2 or HTTP. My idea is to make the life of Sv2 and HTTP easier. Could overhaul `SockMan` in anyway to do that - its current interface is not set in stone. Maybe also worth considering is to have a common library for Sv2 and HTTP and leave P2P (aka `CConnman`) alone, if Sv2 and HTTP have more in common and P2P is odd (i.e. if the intersection of Sv2 and HTTP is big and intersecting that with P2P is small or null).\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "I assume everybody understands the benefits of modular and reusable code. Reusability is actually a metric for code quality. The fact that `SockMan` can be reused from 3 places means this is on the right track. Even if Sv2 and HTTP are completely dropped, this wouldn't change the reusability of `SockMan`. Current `CConnman` is a mixture of low level socket handling and Bitcoin-P2P specifics. IMO this split makes sense even without Sv2 and HTTP because it makes the code more modular and reusable.\r\n\r\nCan the current `SockMan` interface be improved? I am sure it can and I am open to all kinds of suggestions, big or small.",

I hope it is easier to reviewers to just check that a blob of code is moved without having to validate its correctness since that same code is already in `master`.

      "body": "I might be misunderstanding `cancel_recv`, in my HTTP server I set it to `true` when I'm planning on disconnecting a node like if there was an error sending data or if `\"Connection: close\"` is set. However this causes weird behavior where new connections get hung up forever. In particular, `interface_rpc.py` stalls on the ultimate node shutdown and eventually times out after 120 seconds of rpc `stop` not working. When I set `cancel_recv=false` everywhere, i don't have this issue.

It does not do anything about I2P connections that are already established. `ThreadSocketHandler` does both accepting new connections and doing send/recv on existent connections.\r\n\r\nYes, your observation is correct. Listening can fail temporary, e.g. if the I2P router daemon is restarted. This is unlike the TCP listening where once `bind()` and `listen()` succeed, then we are listening until we decide to close the socket. Tor is like I2P - it can fail to listen for a while if the Tor daemon is restarted. Our Tor code has the deficiency that it does not handle that, so it would act as if we are listening (e.g. advertising our Tor address) even if we are not listening.\r\n\r\nCurrent `EventI2PListen` vs `EventI2PConnectivity` - I think \"Connectivity\" would be too broad because this method is only called in the event where we start or stop listening for incoming I2P connections. It is not related to whether we have existent I2P connections or to our ability to make new outgoing I2P connections which \"Connectivity\" would imply.",

So that `cancel_recv` is set in all code paths inside `HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend()`.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- i/src/httpserver.cpp\r\n+++ w/src/httpserver.cpp\r\n@@ -1123,12 +1123,15 @@ bool HTTPServer::EventNewConnectionAccepted(NodeId node_id,\r\n     m_connected_clients.emplace(client->m_node_id, std::move(client));\r\n     return true;\r\n }\r\n \r\n void HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend(NodeId node_id, bool& cancel_recv)\r\n {\r\n+    // Next attempt to receive data from this node is permitted\r\n+    cancel_recv = false;\r\n+\r\n     // Get the HTTPClient\r\n     auto client{WITH_LOCK(m_clients_mutex, return GetClientById(node_id);)};\r\n     if (client == nullptr) {\r\n         return;\r\n     }\r\n \r\n@@ -1149,26 +1152,26 @@ void HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend(NodeId node_id, bool& cancel_recv)\r\n             LogDebug(\r\n                 BCLog::HTTP,\r\n                 \"Error sending HTTP response headers to client %s (id=%lld): %s\\n\",\r\n                 client->m_origin,\r\n                 client->m_node_id,\r\n                 err);\r\n-            cancel_recv = false;\r\n+            cancel_recv = true;\r\n             client->m_disconnect = true;\r\n             return;\r\n         }\r\n \r\n         ssize_t body_bytes_sent = SendBytes(node_id, MakeUCharSpan(res.m_body), /*will_send_more=*/true, err);\r\n         if (body_bytes_sent < 0) {\r\n             LogDebug(\r\n                 BCLog::HTTP,\r\n                 \"Error sending HTTP response body to client %s (id=%lld): %s\\n\",\r\n                 client->m_origin,\r\n                 client->m_node_id,\r\n                 err);\r\n-            cancel_recv = false;\r\n+            cancel_recv = true;\r\n             client->m_disconnect = true;\r\n             return;\r\n         }\r\n \r\n         LogDebug(\r\n             BCLog::HTTP,\r\n@@ -1176,20 +1179,17 @@ void HTTPServer::EventReadyToSend(NodeId node_id, bool& cancel_recv)\r\n             hdr_bytes_sent + body_bytes_sent,\r\n             client->m_origin,\r\n             client->m_node_id);\r\n \r\n         // Our work is done here\r\n         if (!res.m_keep_alive) {\r\n-            cancel_recv = false;\r\n+            cancel_recv = true;\r\n             client->m_disconnect = true;\r\n             return;\r\n         }\r\n     }\r\n-\r\n-    // Next attempt to receive data from this node is permitted\r\n-    cancel_recv = false;\r\n }\r\n \r\n void HTTPServer::EventGotData(NodeId node_id, const uint8_t* data, size_t n)\r\n {\r\n     // Get the HTTPClient\r\n     auto client{WITH_LOCK(m_clients_mutex, return GetClientById(node_id);)};\r\n```",

One would just set the flag and the other would also release the socket reference. My idea was to have both of them require a `reason`-argument and an optional `BCLog::Level`-argument. They would log internally if `fDisconnect` was not already set, instead of having every call site log. `MarkAsDisconnectAndCloseConnection`, seems like an opportunity to do such a thing.\r\n\r\n[WIP disconnecting++ branch](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...hodlinator:bitcoin:2025/01/disconnecting++)\r\n\r\nTotally fine with considering it out of scope for this PR.\r\n```suggestion\r\n                MarkAsDisconnectAndCloseConnection(node, \"socket send error: %s\", err_msg);\r\n```\r\n",

This stays unchanged as peers connect and disconnect. We would want to remove entries from those maps if we stop listening - i.e. if we close the listening socket. This is only done at shutdown.",

It is nice that the check is done at compile time, but if the compiler is not clang then it will be ignored, or if the compiler is clang but is running without `-Werror`, then it will only result in a compile warning which is likely to be missed in the build output. In other words, it is possible to create a violating code and compile and run it with both gcc and clang. In that case `AssertLockNotHeld()` will stop the program at runtime.",

From all callers of `MarkAsDisconnectAndCloseConnection()`:\r\n\r\n* 3 unconditional `LogDebug(BCLog::NET`\r\n* 1 no log\r\n* 2 conditional `LogDebug(BCLog::NET` based on `fDisconnect`\r\n\r\nSo it is not like all the callers do the same thing. Maybe it is ok to consolidate those into one behavior, but would be a functional change that is not the purpose of this PR. Leaving it as it is, but sounds like something to explore as a followup.",

The logic (as convoluted as it is, it is the same in `master`) is:\r\n\r\n* if connecting to `CService`\r\n  * if to an I2P `CService` then proxy must be used\r\n  * otherwise the proxy is optional, if provided it will be used\r\n* if connecting to string host, then proxy must be used\r\n\r\nSo, if `std::variant` is to be avoided and two functions provided instead of one, then they should be called something like `ConnectToCService()` and `ConnectToString()` :-|\r\n\r\nEdit: or a bunch of functions covering each case:\r\n```cpp\r\nConnectToI2P(CService, proxy); // proxy must be used\r\nConnectDirectly(CService); // no proxy\r\nConnectViaProxy(CService, proxy);\r\nConnectViaProxy(string, proxy); // overload\r\n```",

Open a separate PR to remove the manual ref counting on `CNode` and replace it with `shared_ptr` and change `CConnman::m_nodes` from `vector<CNode*>` to `unordered_set<shared_ptr<CNode>>`. That PR would be independent from this one.\r\n\r\n2. In this PR, change the communication between `SockMan` and `CConman` to be based on pointer to `CNode` instead of node id. Similarly to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30988#issuecomment-2485715952. I will start with a raw pointer and the responsibility of destruction will be in `CConnman`, like it is now. If 1. is merged in the mean time before this PR, then I will just change this PR to use `shared_ptr` instead of a raw pointer.",

I think this assertion may be the only real conflict for that. `m_connected_mutex` is only used in `GetConnectionSockets()` -- would a little lock-waiting there be so terrible?",
