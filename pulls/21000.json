          "body": "During discussions and reviews of BIP324 (p2p transport encryption), a more efficient AEAD [was proposed](https://gist.github.com/jonasschnelli/c530ea8421b8d0e80c51486325587c52#gistcomment-3527113).\r\n\r\nThe main difference is how the construct implements re-keying. Since both, the original and the new BIP324 AEAD will not repeat the key handshake over time (no re-keying on the ECDH level), a simpler form of *direct* re-keying has been proposed.\r\n\r\nThe new AEAD uses a ChaCha20 stream cipher where byte 4064 till byte 4096 (last 32 bytes in a 4096 window) are used to re-key the same instance. Re-keying in that context means re-setting the ChaCha20 key (thus setting the constant \"expand 32-byte k\" again, resetting the counter) to the last 32bytes of the current 4096 chunk. We never encrypt more than 4096bytes with the same key. On every re-key, we increase the IV by 1 (a sequence number).\r\nThis should allow forward secrecy in the same way as the old (and slightly cumbersome) rekeying approach.\r\n\r\nThe AEAD is currently only used in tests. The serializer and deserializer for the V2 transport are in #23233.\r\n\r\nBIP324 proposal can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dhruv/5b1275751bc98f3b64bcafce7876b489",

          "body": "This patch\r\n\r\n1. drops an unused `nTime` param from `CAddrMan::Connected_()` and `CAddrMan::Connected()`\r\n\r\n2. makes an `nTime` integer truncations explicit, as `CAddress::nTime` is declared in src/protocol.h as uint32 but int64 values can be written to it in `CAddrMan::Connected_()`. This also fixes the following non-suppressed UBSan error in `addrman.cpp`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nSUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer\r\naddrman.cpp:535:22: runtime error: implicit conversion\r\n  from type 'int64_t' (aka 'long') of value 68719478016 (64-bit, signed)\r\n  to type 'uint32_t' (aka 'unsigned int') changed the value to 1280 (32-bit, unsigned)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(According to https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion, if the destination type is unsigned, the resulting value is the smallest unsigned value equal to the source value modulo (2 exponent n), where n is the number of bits used to represent the destination type. So it seems this is defined behavior and the signed integer is being truncated correctly. However, using a named cast makes the truncation conversion explicit and reduces the warnings by the UBSan integer sanitizer.)\r\n\r\n3. does the same for two similar UBSan errors in `CAddrMan::Add_()` that were suppressed\r\n\r\n4. fixes the following UBSan error in `CAddrMan::Unserialize()` that was suppressed\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nSUMMARY: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer\r\naddrman.h:320:43: runtime error: implicit conversion\r\n  from type 'int' of value -32 (32-bit, signed)\r\n  to type 'const uint8_t' (aka 'const unsigned char')\r\n  changed the value to 224 (8-bit, unsigned)\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. removes the four addrman UBSan suppressions\r\n\r\n6. adds TODO documentation for updates needed by the Year 2106\r\n\r\nTo test\r\n```\r\n$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure --enable-fuzz --with-sanitizers=fuzzer,address,undefined,integer CC=clang CXX=clang++ && make clean && make\r\n$ FUZZ=addrman src/test/fuzz/fuzz ../qa-assets/fuzz_seed_corpus/addrman\r\n```\r\n",
