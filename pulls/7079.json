    "body": "Currently it's possible for peers to send duplicate invs of the same object and push the inv request time far back.\n\nPR #4547 sought to address this, but was closed with the expectation that it would be replaced by the more comprehensive #4831 but the latter hasn't yet reached escape velocity. I agree a comprehensive rework is better, but I think we should not let a simple improvement wait for that.\n\nPR #6306 tried a simpler version, but by reusing the setInventoryKnown it gets the logic somewhat wrong, e.g. not allowing duplicate INVs even for objects we'd mempool retired but now would be accept again.\n\nHere I bring back #4547 and add size limiting and make an important change to the logic (which I believe was originally flawed, though no one seems to have commented on that in the original PR):\n\nThe earlier PR would remove the suppression as soon as the getdata was _requested_, rather than removing it when response was returned. This one removes only when we decide to not getdata (because we already have) or when the getdata returns. This means that a peer can only have one in-flight INV for a particular tx at once; which is what we want.\n",

As a result, a peer can blind a node to a tx indefinitely by\nsending many invs for the same tx, and then never replying to getdatas for it.\nEach inv received will be placed 2 minutes farther back in mapAlreadyAskedFor,\nso a short message containing 10 invs would render that tx unavailable for 20\nminutes.\n\nThis is fixed by disallowing a peer from having more than one entry for a\nparticular inv in mapAlreadyAskedFor at a time.",

          "body": "Although some code has already been introduced for \"misbehaving\" nodes, I think this could be further extended.\n\nE.g. nodes ignoring getdata requests. So far, this can cause a node to wait 2 minutes before re-asking, but if enough nodes started ignoring getdata requests, this could possibly cause significant detriment to the network.\n\nI propose some code that allows nodes to learn the network speed they are operating on, e.g. average times between asking for a tx or a block and receiving one. Then it should be possible to introduce timeouts for nodes which are significantly taking longer than average, and mark them as suspicious (may be that they just have poor network connectivity). This can be particularly of significance when catching up with the blockchain.\n\nBy learning network speeds, the node can determine whether to download blocks from a number of nodes at once, rather than just one at a time, and also whether to upload blocks to many nodes at once or just one at a time.\n",
