    "body": "Currently it's possible for peers to send duplicate invs of the same object and push the inv request time far back.\n\nPR #4547 sought to address this, but was closed with the expectation that it would be replaced by the more comprehensive #4831 but the latter hasn't yet reached escape velocity. I agree a comprehensive rework is better, but I think we should not let a simple improvement wait for that.\n\nPR #6306 tried a simpler version, but by reusing the setInventoryKnown it gets the logic somewhat wrong, e.g. not allowing duplicate INVs even for objects we'd mempool retired but now would be accept again.\n\nHere I bring back #4547 and add size limiting and make an important change to the logic (which I believe was originally flawed, though no one seems to have commented on that in the original PR):\n\nThe earlier PR would remove the suppression as soon as the getdata was _requested_, rather than removing it when response was returned. This one removes only when we decide to not getdata (because we already have) or when the getdata returns. This means that a peer can only have one in-flight INV for a particular tx at once; which is what we want.\n",

As a result, a peer can blind a node to a tx indefinitely by\nsending many invs for the same tx, and then never replying to getdatas for it.\nEach inv received will be placed 2 minutes farther back in mapAlreadyAskedFor,\nso a short message containing 10 invs would render that tx unavailable for 20\nminutes.\n\nThis is fixed by disallowing a peer from having more than one entry for a\nparticular inv in mapAlreadyAskedFor at a time.",
