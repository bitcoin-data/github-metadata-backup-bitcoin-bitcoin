    "body": "block-relay-only connections are additional outbound connections that bitcoind makes since v0.19. They participate in block relay, but do not propagate transactions or addresses. They were introduced in #15759.\r\n\r\nWhen creating an outbound block-relay-only connection, since we know that we're never going to announce transactions over that connection, we can save on memory usage by not a `TxRelay` data structure for that connection. When receiving an inbound connection, we don't know whether the connection was opened by the peer as block-relay-only or not, and therefore we always construct a `TxRelay` data structure for inbound connections.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to tell whether an inbound connection will ever request that we start announcing transactions to it. The `fRelay` field in the `version` message may be set to `0` to indicate that the peer does not wish to receive transaction announcements. The peer may later request that we start announcing transactions to it by sending a `filterload` or `filterclear` message, **but only if we have offered `NODE_BLOOM` services to that peer**. `NODE_BLOOM` services are disabled by default, and it has been recommended for some time that users not enable `NODE_BLOOM` services on public connections, for privacy and anti-DoS reasons.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we have not offered `NODE_BLOOM` to the peer _and_ it has set `fRelay` to `0`, then we know that it will never request transaction announcements, and that we can save resources by not initializing the `TxRelay` data structure.",

      "body": "Well, I said \"rough\", but did not mean _that_ rough. Somehow I wrongly assumed that none of the constructors allocate extra memory from the heap :disappointed:. Now I checked that `CRollingBloomFilter{50000, 0.000001}` creates and fills a vector of 67'396 `uint64_t` elements, or 539'168 bytes. For 10 peers that would save ~5MB.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it would make sense to delay the creation of `CRollingBloomFilter::data` until it is actually needed (e.g. create it in the first insert, rather than in the constructor, would be changes isolated solely inside `CRollingBloomFilter`). `CRollingBloomFilter` is also used here:\r\n\r\n* `BanMan::m_discouraged`, would benefit from lazy creation because we may never ban anybody, but is just one filter per program instance.\r\n* `Peer::m_addr_known`, looks like if created then it will be certainly used, one per peer.\r\n* `PeerManagerImpl::m_recent_rejects` and `PeerManagerImpl::m_recent_confirmed_transactions`, likely to be used, one per program instance.\r\n* `CNodeState::m_recently_announced_invs`, would benefit like `CNode::TxRelay::filterInventoryKnown`, one per peer.\r\n\r\nMaybe only `CNodeState::m_recently_announced_invs` is worth considering?",

      "body": "Thanks for the review @mzumsande. I've responded to your review comment. Let m know what you think.\r\n\r\nI've also marked this as ready for review.\r\n\r\nNote the behaviour change for `feefilter` messages. With the current branch, for a peer that indicates that they don't want us to relay messages with fRelay=false in the `version` message, we will no longer send `feefilter` messages. I think that's fine, but it can easily be changed by pulling the `m_fee_filter_sent` and `m_next_send_feefilter` members out of `Peer::TxRelay` and into `Peer`. That makes sense since all other members of `TxRelay` are concerned with relaying transactions _to_ the peer, and those two members are concerned with receiving transactions _from_ the peer, so they don't really belong int `TxRelay`.",

All of the other members of `TxRelay` are related to\nsending transactions _to_ the peer, whereas m_fee_filter_sent and\nm_next_send_feefilter are both related to receiving transactions _from_\nthe peer. A node's tx relay behaviour is not always symmetrical (eg a\nblocksonly node will ignore incoming transactions, but may still send\nout its own transactions), so it doesn't make sense to group the\nfeefilter sending data with the TxRelay data in a single structure.\n\nThis does not change behaviour, since IsBlockOnlyConn() is always equal\nto !peer.m_tx_relay. We still don't send feefilter messages to outbound\nblock-relay-only peers (tested in p2p_feefilter.py).",

I think the comment is correct.\r\n\r\n> Arguably, this field could be moved out of TxRelay then. Or perhaps we should use another timer for mempool.\r\n\r\nI think it'd be better to simply remove support for the `mempool` message. I think it's unlikely that many people are using it, and it'd be better to provide this functionality (exposing the contents of the mempool) through rpc rather than a 'private' p2p extension.",
