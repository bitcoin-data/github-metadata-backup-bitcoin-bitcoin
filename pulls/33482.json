    "body": "**Description**\r\nFrom what I deciphered reading the line https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/macdeploy/macdeployqtplus#L390 is that qt translations are optional to have hence we should be able to build without it but the case where the flag translations_dir falls back to its default Null value it raises this error.\r\n\r\nThe config comments also mentioned that adding translation file is optional.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./macdeployqtplus --help\r\nusage: macdeployqtplus [-h] [-verbose [VERBOSE]] [-no-plugins] [-no-strip] [-translations-dir path] [-zip zip] app-bundle\r\n\r\nImproved version of macdeployqt. Outputs a ready-to-deploy app in a folder \"dist\" and optionally wraps it in a .zip file. Note, that the \"dist\" folder will be deleted before deploying on each run. Optionally, Qt translation files\r\n(.qm) can be added to the bundle.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\nSo I was following the general steps to set up app on macos however I didn't download any qt translations presuming it was optional from the comment linkedin in PR, so to reproduce if you have translation directories in place ull need to delete them and then try to build the file, otherwise don't download it at all and try to build it. It should fail on that flag as translations dir was never downloaded.\r\n\r\n**Approach taken**\r\nI have moved the code which adds language files under the if statement that first checks if the value of the flag is not Null before referencing it.\r\n",

Outputs a ready-to-deploy app in a folder \"dist\" and optionally wraps it in a .zip file. Note, that the \"dist\" folder will be deleted before deploying on each run. Optionally, Qt translation files\r\n(.qm) can be added to the bundle.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo help in attracting more review to this patch.\r\n\r\nCan you explicitly highlight the issue here, the steps you take to produce the error and whether or not it is reproducible.\r\n\r\nBut overall It seems like an issue to me, and the right approach to fix it is taken here which is adding loading the translation file to the if branch that verifies the option has been added.\r\n",
