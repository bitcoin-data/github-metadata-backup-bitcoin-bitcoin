    "body": "Prior to this commit callers of `FindNode(...)` were required to be holding `cs_vNodes` in the cases where they used the returned `CNode*` for anything aside from existence-checking (see #9626).\r\n\r\nThis resulted in locking `cs_vNodes` twice since `FindNode(...)` had a `LOCK(cs_vNodes);`.\r\n\r\nTo solve this and to make the locking requirements more explicit this commit does the following:\r\n* Add explicit locking requirements for `FindNode(...)` using `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_vNodes)`.\r\n* Remove the now redundant `LOCK(cs_vNodes)` in `FindNode(...)`.\r\n* Add a method `CConnman::NodeExists(...)` for existence-checking. Calling this method does not require holding `cs_vNodes`.",

Add NodeExists(...).\n\nPrior to this commit callers of `FindNode(...)` were required to\nbe holding `cs_vNodes` only in the cases where they used the\nreturned `CNode*` for anything aside from existence-checking\n(see #9626).\n\nThis resulted in locking `cs_vNodes` twice since `FindNode(...)`\nhad a `LOCK(cs_vNodes);`.\n\nTo solve this and to make the locking requirements more explicit this\ncommit does the following:\n* Add explicit locking requirements for `FindNode(...)`\n  using `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_vNodes)`.\n* Remove the now redundant `LOCK(cs_vNodes)` in `FindNode(...)`.\n* Add a method `CConnman::NodeExists(...)` for existence-checking.\n  Calling this method does not require holding `cs_vNodes`.",

          "title": "[WIP] Add Clang thread safety analysis annotations: GUARDED_BY(lock) / EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(lock)",
          "body": "Add additional Clang thread safety analysis annotations as discussed with @sipa (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10866#issuecomment-316238630) and others.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to #10866 ~~which this PR is rebased upon (awaiting merge of #10866). The first three commits (8a1dc09, e022990 and cbae151) can be reviewed in #10866.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR contains three types of changes:\r\n1. Add missing locks (based on the `GUARDED_BY(...)` analysis below). Please review thoroughly.\r\n2. Add `GUARDED_BY(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n3. Add `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n\r\nBackground reading: The [\"C/C++ Thread Safety Analysis\"](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/42958.pdf) paper (Hutchins, Ballman & Sutherland, 2014) paper describing Clang thread safety analysis and how it is used for the Google C++ codebase:\r\n\r\n> They essentially provide a static type system for threads, and can detect potential race conditions and deadlocks. This paper describes Clang Thread Safety Analysis, a tool which uses annotations to declare and enforce thread safety policies in C and C++ programs.\r\n> […]\r\n> It has been deployed on a large scale at Google; all C++ code at Google is now compiled with thread safety analysis enabled by default.\r\n> […]\r\n> The `GUARDED_BY` attribute declares that a thread must lock `mu` before it can read or write to `balance`, thus ensuring that the increment and decrement operations are atomic. Similarly, `REQUIRES` declares that the calling thread must lock mu before calling `withdrawImpl`. Because the caller is assumed to have locked `mu,` it is safe to modify `balance` within the body of the method.",
