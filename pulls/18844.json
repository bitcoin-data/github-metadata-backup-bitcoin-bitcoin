    "body": "Berkeley DB uses a database transaction log to ensure Durability (the D of ACID). But we already have a couple of options enabled that remove the guarantee of Durability anyways (we enable DB_TXN_WRITE_NOSYNC). So the log already isn't as useful to us as it could be. Furthermore, we don't really make use of the BDB's transaction feature. Almost every single read and write that we do is itself atomic and a single transaction. We do each read and write of a record as a single transaction. Flushing is always done when a `WalletBatch` is destroyed, and we have many single use `WalletBatch` objects.\r\n\r\nWe do, in a few places, batch transactions so even after a transaction is committed, it may not be flushed to the database. In those instances, the log is useful as it does recover whatever wasn't written. But whatever didn't get written also doesn't matter. If a new transaction was being written, the blockchain can be rescanned. If new metadata was being written, the user can just re-enter it. For newly generated keys, those keys didn't see any use if their records didn't get flushed to the db (that flushing always happens before the key generation function returns). So it's fine to lose those keys, and for HD wallets, they will be regenerated anyways, so nothing is lost.\r\n\r\nThe single exception to the single record single transaction that we usually do is with encrypting existing private keys. This encryption is done in a single transaction so that it is atomic, and that is many records being written. But even with that, the transaction log isn't useful. We abort before anything is flushed to disk so the wallet state is not inconsistent and all of the unencrypted private keys are still there. The encryption can then be redone. So the log is not useful there.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we are already trying to get rid of the transaction log as much as possible. We turn on the auto remove (DB_LOG_AUTO_REMOVE) and the logs are always cleaned up on a clean shutdown. As mentioned earlier, the transaction log already has a flag that doesn't always flush the log anyways. So I don't think that just completely avoiding transaction logs entirely is unreasonable.\r\n\r\nLogs are disabled by using the db flag DB_TXN_NOT_DURABLE to prevent logs being written for a db, and using the db env flag DB_LOG_IN_MEMORY to keep all db environment logs in memory.\r\n\r\nNot having the BDB logs additionally allows us to remove the BDB 4.8 requirement. This requirement was because the Oracle keeps changing the log file format. The database file format itself has not changed in a long time. The log file format difference would supposedly make downgrades more difficult because the log files are not downgradable. However in my testing, this was not actually the case as the log files would be moved out of the way if the database could not be opened, so downgrading wasn't that much of a problem, especially with clean shutdowns. Not having the transaction log be written at all makes this not a problem entirely as there aren't any log files to get in the way. So we can now allow for other BDB versions.\r\n\r\nBumping to BDB 5.3 is done only because that's the version that is provided by many (most?) distros. With this change, `--with-incompatible-bdb` is no longer needed and we can simply build and installation instructions to just \"install bdb from your package manager\".\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis change might be contentions, so here are some alternatives that we might want to discuss:\r\n* Not having logs at all might make the wallet more unreliable. Maybe instead of getting rid of the logs entirely we can output compatible log files for use in BDB 4.8. But that's clunky and just locks us into BDB 5.3 (or whatever version).\r\n  * We could possibly have our own consistent log file format which is then loaded into BDB somehow\r\n* Instead of no logs at all, when we encounter newer log files, copy them (as we do now) and the wallet.dat file to a backup location in the walletdir so that users can recover them if they see consistency issues with the wallet file. This still lets us change BDB.",

You don't even need the changes in this PR to find that out for yourself. The log changes here aren't strictly necessary for BDB 5.3 The wallet.dat files themselves are portable between these versions. From the documentation that I've found, we should be able to use the same wallet.dat files down to BDB 4.0, and up to the latest version of BDB\r\n\r\n> I'm confused about motivation for this PR though.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to remove the strict requirement for BDB 4.8.\r\n\r\n> The goal of this is to make database writes more reliable?\r\n\r\nIt actually does the opposite currently, which is why I added the section at the bottom about alternatives. When I wrote this, I assumed that flushes were occurring immediately after we were done writing a record, but this appears to not be the case. There is a bit of a delay which is mostly not human noticeable but this has an effect on a test like `feature_backwards_compatibility` where a wallet file ends up being copied before it's flushed so is missing data.",

      "body": "My recollection is that the log files have _no_ compatibility guarantees, not even backward compatibility for minor versions (i.e. you can't use a database+log from 4.7 in 4.8) - which is why we flush logs on exit. The database itself is backward compatible, but not forward compatible (you can use db files from 4.7 in 4.8 but not the other way around).\r\n\r\nI'm unsure about the goal here. There used to be frequent issues with wallets being unable to be opened, and we ended up making several frequent changes to the BDB settings we open envs/databases with. At some point those issues stopped, so I suspect we found a fairly stable configuration. I wouldn't touch these things without going back through history to see what has been tried before.",

      "body": "I've gone through their older versions to check compatibility. The only changes that were made were the depends package for BDB and `configure.ac` to allow other versions. The following versions could be compiled and `feature_backwards_compatibility.py` passes with a minor change to unload the `w3` wallets before the files are copied. `feature_backwards_compatibility.py` opens new wallets from the branch in 0.19, 0.18, and 0.17 and the reverse. So this tests the compatibility of the wallet.dat file.\r\n\r\n* 4.7.25\r\n* 4.8.30\r\n* 5.0.32\r\n* 5.1.29\r\n* 5.2.42\r\n* 5.3.29\r\n\r\nVersions 6.0 introduces a new database file version which is not backwards compatible. But it is possible to take an existing wallet.dat, use it with 6.0+, and then go back to the older BDB versions. BDB won't change a database's format without an explicit upgrade.\r\n\r\nVersions 4.6 and lower have API differences. 4.6.21 had a minimal change and after applying it, the wallet.dat file still worked. 4.5.20 and lower have further API differences that I didn't feel like going through to check the database file compatibility.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nGiven this information, I think that something reasonable to do is to remove `--with-incompatible-db` and the messaging about the wallet.dat file not being portable. As these tests show, the wallet.dat file is portable across many versions. **Only the log files are not portable and those are removed upon clean shutdown**. Thus I think we should let people use system BDB instead of recommending 4.8. We can still ship 4.8 in release builds.",
