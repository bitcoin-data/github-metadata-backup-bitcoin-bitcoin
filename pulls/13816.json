    "body": "This pull requests enables building and running the project with `os: osx`, sort of natively on os x instead of cross-compiling and not running the tests.\r\n\r\nTo achieve that the `before_install`, `install`, `before_script`, and `script` parts were externalized into `.travis/before_install` etc. These scripts exist for both `linux` (which runs everything in docker) and `osx` (which runs everything directly).\r\n\r\nHaving the steps externalized in individual scripts makes them more readable and subject to `shellcheck` (`lint-shell.sh`).\r\n\r\nThe `shellcheck` executable segfaults on me, which is why it's now being run via docker. This has a nice side effect, namely that a more recent version of shellcheck can be used. The runtime of the lint step is not affected to much by it (it's still around 1 minute as it was before).\r\n\r\nThe newer shellcheck also comes with more lint rules of which I disabled some as I did not want to touch too much stuff in this single pull request, which is primarily about a reorganization of the travis build.",

Means that if I have LC_ALL set and exported and run this script it will segfault. So to me it looks as if unsetting LC_ALL for good should be required on all platforms.\r\n\r\nI can see how this makes one uneasy (at least it makes me uneasy). According to one of the lints all scripts _should_ set LC_ALL=C and export it in order to make it not behave differently on different platforms. Unfortunately that makes shellcheck segfault/coredump. As I learned the hard way.\r\n\r\nI am wondering if there is a specific locale which does not make it segfault, but I would assume that that locale is exactly the default locale for the platform. And as long as none of the shell scripts use any fancy characters (basically ASCII only) it should not come to any behavior changes in between any modern platforms.",

That way we document when it is needed which will help us make an informed decision on when to remove the workaround in the future, such as when that specific problematic `shellcheck` version/binary is no longer in active use.
