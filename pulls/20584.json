          "body": "Add I2P support by using the [I2P SAM](https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3) protocol. Unlike Tor, for incoming connections we get the I2P address of the peer (and they also receive ours when we are the connection initiator).\r\n\r\nTwo new options are added:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  -i2psam=<ip:port>\r\n       I2P SAM proxy to reach I2P peers and accept I2P connections (default:\r\n       none)\r\n\r\n  -i2pacceptincoming\r\n       If set and -i2psam is also set then incoming I2P connections are\r\n       accepted via the SAM proxy. If this is not set but -i2psam is set\r\n       then only outgoing connections will be made to the I2P network.\r\n       Ignored if -i2psam is not set. Notice that listening for incoming\r\n       I2P connections is done through the SAM proxy, not by binding to\r\n       a local address and port (default: true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Overview of the changes\r\n\r\n## Make `ReadBinary()` and `WriteBinary()` reusable\r\n\r\nWe would need to dump the I2P private key to a file and read it back later. Move those two functions out of `torcontrol.cpp`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nutil: extract {Read,Write}BinaryFile() to its own files\r\nutil: fix ReadBinaryFile() returning partial contents\r\nutil: fix WriteBinaryFile() claiming success even if error occurred\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Split `CConnman::AcceptConnection()`\r\n\r\nMost of `CConnman::AcceptConnection()` is agnostic of how the socket was accepted. The other part of it deals with the details of the `accept(2)` system call. Split those so that the protocol-agnostic part can be reused if we accept a socket by other means.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnet: check for invalid socket earlier in CConnman::AcceptConnection()\r\nnet: get the bind address earlier in CConnman::AcceptConnection()\r\nnet: isolate the protocol-agnostic part of CConnman::AcceptConnection()\r\nnet: avoid unnecessary GetBindAddress() call\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implement the I2P [SAM](https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3) protocol (not all of it)\r\n\r\nJust the parts that would enable us to make outgoing and accept incoming I2P connections.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnet: extend CNetAddr::SetSpecial() to support I2P\r\nnet: move the constant maxWait out of InterruptibleRecv()\r\nnet: dedup MSG_NOSIGNAL and MSG_DONTWAIT definitions\r\nnet: extend Sock::Wait() to report a timeout\r\nnet: extend Sock with methods for robust send & read until terminator\r\nnet: extend Sock with a method to check whether connected\r\nnet: implement the necessary parts of the I2P SAM protocol\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use I2P SAM to connect to and accept connections from I2P peers\r\n\r\nProfit from all of the preceding commits.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninit: introduce I2P connectivity options\r\nnet: add I2P to the reachability map\r\nnet: make outgoing I2P connections from CConnman\r\nnet: accept incoming I2P connections from CConnman\r\nnet: recognize I2P from ParseNetwork() so that -onlynet=i2p works\r\nnet: Do not skip the I2P network from GetNetworkNames()\r\n```",

We get clearer visibility into what currently lies in consensus codepaths **and** what depends on our consensus engine\r\n> 1. We can coalesce duplicate consensus initialization codepaths, mitigating against bugs that arise out of test/non-test initialization inconsistencies\r\n\r\n### De-globalizing `g_chainman`\r\n\r\nExcerpt from #20049\r\n> In order to modularize our consensus engine, we need to first de-globalize the global `ChainstateManager` -- namely `g_chainman` -- as it and its dependencies are what makes up the bulk of our consensus engine. A few direct references to `g_chainman` have already been removed in #19927, however, its indirect uses (mainly via `::Chain(state|)Active()`) are numerous in our codebase and often used to ~~cheat~~ avoid obtaining a `ChainstateManager` reference.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis changeset moves the global `ChainstateManger` to `NodeContext` and removes `::Chain{state,}Active()` as a first step towards better modularization of our consensus engine. \r\n\r\nThe commits are ordered as such:\r\n1. Fixes to our existing codebase crucial to subsequent changes in this changeset\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...dongcarl:2020-10-chainman-fixes\r\n1. Remove all references to `g_chainman`, `::Chain{state,}Active()`\r\n\t1. In `src/validation.{cpp,h}`\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions related to `::LookupBlockIndex` in the call graph\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/2020-10-chainman-fixes...dongcarl:2020-09-libbitcoinruntime-v4\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions that are mempool-related\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/dongcarl:2020-09-libbitcoinruntime-v4...2020-09-reduce-validation-mempool-ccsactiveglobal-usage\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions which do not belong in previous bundles\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/2020-09-reduce-validation-mempool-ccsactiveglobal-usage...dongcarl:2020-09-reduce-validation-ccsactiveglobal-usage\r\n\t1.

In `src/txmempool.cpp`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/miner.cpp`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/node`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/net_processing.cpp`\r\n\t1.

In `src/rest.cpp`\r\n\t1. In auxiliary modules of the codebase\r\n\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/dongcarl:2020-10-libbitcoinruntime-v7...2020-10-libbitcoinruntime-v8\r\n\t\t1. In `src/bench`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/index`\r\n\t1.

In `src/test`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/wallet/test`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/qt/test`\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n- The above ordering is constructed according to the overall call graph of our codebase such that we avoid touching the same function/module twice. \r\n- Due to the length of this overall change, each commit aims to be trivially-reviewable and only requires the reviewer to reason about the correctness of one function/module at a time.\r\n- There are a lot of review-only assertions which can be used to check for correctness. They are removed in 2236237070a45fe570cd0113f0025b0a46ac89be.\r\n",

There may be seemingly obvious local references to `ChainstateManager` or other validation objects which are not being used in callers of the current function in question, this is done intentionally to **_keep each commit centered around one function/method_** to ease review and to make the overall change systematic. We don't assume anything about our callers. Rest assured that once we are considering that particular caller in later commits, we will use the obvious local references. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n3. When changing a function/method that has many callers (e.g. `LookupBlockIndex` with 55 callers), it is sometimes easier (and less error-prone) to use a scripted-diff. When doing so, there will be 3 commits in sequence so that every commit compiles like so:\r\n\t1. Add `new_function`, make `old_function` a wrapper of `new_function`, divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the local module only**\r\n\t2.

          "title": "rpc/validation: enable packages through testmempoolaccept",
          "body": "This PR enables validation dry-runs of packages through the `testmempoolaccept` RPC. The expectation is that the results returned from `testmempoolaccept` are what you'd get from test-then-submitting each transaction individually, in that order (this means the package is expected to be sorted in topological order, for now at least). The validation is also atomic: in the case of failure, it immediately halts and may return \"unfinished\" `MempoolAcceptResult`s for transactions that weren't fully validated. The API for 1 transaction stays the same.\r\n\r\n**Motivation:** \r\n- This allows you to test validity for transaction chains (e.g. with multiple spending paths and where you don't want to broadcast yet); closes #18480.\r\n- It's also a first step towards package validation in a minimally invasive way.\r\n- The RPC commit happens to close #21074 by clarifying the \"allowed\" key.\r\n\r\nThere are a few added restrictions on the packages, mostly to simplify the logic for areas that aren't critical to main package use cases:\r\n- No package can have conflicts, i.e. none of them can spend the same inputs, even if it would be a valid BIP125 replacement.\r\n- The package cannot conflict with the mempool, i.e. RBF is disabled.\r\n- The total count of the package cannot exceed 25 (the default descendant count limit), and total size cannot exceed 101KvB (the default descendant size limit).\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for review comments and github isn't loading them, I have a gist compiling some topics of discussion [here](https://gist.github.com/glozow/c3acaf161c95bba491fce31585b2aaf7)\r\n",
