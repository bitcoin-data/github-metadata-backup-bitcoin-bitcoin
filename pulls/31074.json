    "body": "Replace `tinyformat::format` overload that used to accept `bilingual_str` runtime format strings with an overload that only accepts `bilingual_lit` literal format strings that are checked for correctness at compile time.\r\n\r\nThis PR is alternative to #31061 that has somewhat messier syntax, but a cleaner implementation and a less confusing API. Unlike #31061, the `_` and `Untranslated` functions continue to return `bilingual_str` structs with `original` and `translated` members instead of keeping `bilingual_str` but also returning different structs with `lit` and `translate()` members. This is less confusing because it means there's a single type for representing bilingual values, and means that unlike #31061, code that is not doing string formatting does not need to change. Only code actually using tinyformat changes here.\r\n\r\nA drawback to this change compared to #31061 is that syntax for translated format strings is messier:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    return strprintf(_(\"%s is set very high!\"), optname);\r\n+    return strprintf(_<\"%s is set very high!\">(), optname);\r\n```\r\nBut that's also a good way of showing that the string is used at compile time, and without this, there's no way to get the `_` function to return a type that is compatible with bilingual_str.\r\n\r\nMarking this as a draft because I need to think about differences of the two approaches. But I am inclined to think this approach is better because it is not fighting with compiler to be able evaluate function arguments at compile time, when this is supposed to be what template arguments are for https://old.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/lxmv2z/allowing_parameters_of_consteval_function_to_be/gpp40lf/\r\n",
