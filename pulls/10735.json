The changes were simple enough that I decided it was okay to impose merge conflicts on pulling in those refactors later.\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#9200\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#9202\r\n  - Adds support for measuring CPU cycles, which is later removed in an upstream PR after the refactor. I am including it to reduce future merge conflicts.\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#9281\r\n  - Only changes to `src/bench/bench.cpp`\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#9498\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#9712\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#9547\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#9505\r\n  - Just the benchmark, not the performance improvements.\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#9792\r\n  - Just the benchmark, not the performance improvements.\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#10272\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#10395\r\n  - Only changes to `src/bench/`\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#10735\r\n  - Only changes to `src/bench/base58.cpp`\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#10963\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#11303\r\n  - Only the benchmark backend change.\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#11562\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#11646\r\n- bitcoin/bitcoin#11654\r\n\r\nThis pulls in all changes to the micro-benchmark framework prior to December 2017, when it was rewritten. The rewrite depends on other upstream PRs we have not pulled in yet.\r\n\r\nThis does not pull in all benchmarks prior to December 2017. It leaves out benchmarks that either test code we do not have yet (except for the `FastRandomContext` refactor, which I decided to pull in), or would require rewrites to work with our changes to the codebase.",
