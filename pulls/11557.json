    "body": "I thought this would be a simple UI change, but it turns out to be more involved. So first I'd like to find out if these changes are considered useful, non contentious and if I'm using the right approach.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell recently refactored  the consensus code to emphasize block weight over block size (#10618). My idea was to make the fee UI consistent with this, by using weight units (WU) instead of bytes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I don't think the users currency preference (μBTC / mBTC / BTC) should be applied to the fee UI. This preference makes sense for the users balance, for a transaction amount and the absolute fee value. Because the fee is per unit of size / weight, it makes more sense to me to express this in Sat / WU.\r\n\r\nIf people agree, then I'd like to remove the (μ/m)BTC dropdown from the fee UI:\r\n<img width=\"820\" alt=\"schermafbeelding 2017-10-25 om 18 19 58\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/31994345-e907a71c-b9b2-11e7-9794-8f08b3c2bfb2.png\">\r\n\r\nThis also frees up some space which I'd like to use (different PR) to show the fee as a percentage of the transaction amount, which should help prevent unintentionally large fees.\r\n\r\nI think Sat/WU makes for more readable numbers than BTC/kWU would. People generally find numbers between 0.01 and 100 easy to work with, because they're used to cents and dollars. Several fee estimators currently use Sat/Byte, where 1 is the minimum relay fee, 10-100 is the usual range, people start complaining when it goes over. Assuming fees in dollar terms stay in the same range, or even a factor ten more, Sat/WU produces easy to read numbers for a price range of $500 (100 - 1000 sat/WU) to $5 million (0.01 - 0.10 sat/WU).\r\n\r\nIt looks like `CFeeRate` shouldn't be used with floats. This creates a problem, because 1 Sat/B is 0.25 Sat/WU. Bumping this to 1 Sat/WU doesn't seem unreasonable with current typical fee levels, but this would change functionality at more levels than just the UI.\r\n\r\nThis WIP is completely broken; changing `CFeeRate` to be in terms of sat/WU means I'd have to make more changes. There might be lighter tough way to change the UI.",

Switching to weight would be confusing - would we be talking about satoshi/weightbyte?\r\n\r\nThis [fee estimation article](https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_wallet_dev/#transaction-fee-estimation) is also useful.\r\n\r\n\"Virtual size in bytes\" has the additional benefit of being more intuitive than \"weight units\" in a UI.\r\n\r\nDo I understand correctly that the current fee estimator doesn't use `vsize` yet? Changing that sounds a bit too daunting for me at this point. I can open a separate issue / PR, once `vsize` is implemented, to suggest using Sat / Virtual Byte.",

          "body": "Currently the send screen displays the fee in terms of (μ/m)BTC/kB, depending on a global preference. When entering a custom fee the user can select (μ/m)BTC using a dropdown. The resulting numbers are quite hard to read, often with five leading zeros.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"589\" alt=\"schermafbeelding 2017-10-26 om 18 06 10\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/32047392-62ff7c5a-ba78-11e7-9505-a08580e7e7a3.png\">\r\n\r\nThis makes it too easy to make an off-by-ten mistake, especially because the wallet doesn't display fiat values.\r\n\r\nI think Sat per Virtual Byte (vByte?) makes for more readable numbers. People generally find numbers between 0.01 and 100 easy to work with, because they're used to cents and dollars. Several fee estimators currently use Sat/vByte, where 1 is the minimum relay fee, 10-100 is the usual range, people start complaining when it goes over.\r\n\r\nI also think this choice is quite durable, even if the price increases by orders of magnitude and fees get worse (low fees would not really be a UX issue). Assuming fees in dollar terms stay in the same range, or even a factor ten more, Sat/vByte produces easy to read numbers for a price range of $500 (100 - 1000 sat/vByte) to $5 million (0.01 - 0.10 sat/vByte).\r\n\r\nIn this case the (μ/m)BTC dropdown could be removed from the fee UI; I don't think the users currency preference (μBTC / mBTC / BTC) should be applied to the fee UI. This preference makes sense for the users balance, for a transaction amount and the absolute fee value.\r\n\r\nThere would still some confusion if people look at other fee estimators on the web which currently often user fee per byte, based on non-segwit transactions.\r\n\r\nHopefully the industry will trend towards a single metric for fees, so people can develop an intuition for them, decreasing the likeliness of mistakes.\r\n\r\nI can make a PR is people think this is a good idea.",
