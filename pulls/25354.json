    "body": "The current implementation of ChaCha20 [advances the block](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/37633d2f61697fc719390767aae740ece978b074/src/crypto/chacha20.cpp#L310) even when the last pseudorandom block of 64 bytes is only partially used. This code buffers and reuses those pseudorandom bytes.\r\n\r\nThis improvement is relevant to the new design of BIP324 where:\r\n- One instance of ChaCha20(for encrypting the length) uses only 3 pseudorandom bytes per message, so throwing away 61/64 bytes would be a 95% waste.\r\n- There are efficiencies to be had from being able to send a vector of plaintexts to encrypt rather than creating a concatenated buffer, but that means the block cannot be advanced in between calls.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this also means that our implementation is no longer identical to the reference implementation by Daniel J Bernstein (if I had to guess though, closer to his intention for a stream cipher), and the differential fuzz test against his implementation from #22704 no longer makes sense (if it's not against the pristine version, it does not serve the original purpose)",

          "body": "During discussions and reviews of BIP324 (p2p transport encryption), a more efficient AEAD [was proposed](https://gist.github.com/jonasschnelli/c530ea8421b8d0e80c51486325587c52#gistcomment-3527113).\r\n\r\nThe main difference is how the construct implements re-keying. Since both, the original and the new BIP324 AEAD will not repeat the key handshake over time (no re-keying on the ECDH level), a simpler form of *direct* re-keying has been proposed.\r\n\r\nThe new AEAD uses a ChaCha20 stream cipher where byte 4064 till byte 4096 (last 32 bytes in a 4096 window) are used to re-key the same instance. Re-keying in that context means re-setting the ChaCha20 key (thus setting the constant \"expand 32-byte k\" again, resetting the counter) to the last 32bytes of the current 4096 chunk. We never encrypt more than 4096bytes with the same key. On every re-key, we increase the IV by 1 (a sequence number).\r\nThis should allow forward secrecy in the same way as the old (and slightly cumbersome) rekeying approach.\r\n\r\nThe AEAD is currently only used in tests. The serializer and deserializer for the V2 transport are in #23233.\r\n\r\nBIP324 proposal can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dhruv/5b1275751bc98f3b64bcafce7876b489",

The RFC8439 instance is re-keyed every 256 messages for forward secrecy.\r\n* Outer layer uses a forward secure version of ChaCha20, `FSChaCha20` which re-keys itself every 256 messages for forward secrecy. It is used to encrypt the message length resulting in a pseudorandom byte stream.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).",

      "body": "Concept ACK on changing this; it much more closely matches the expectation of a stream cipher interface, especially as the specification does not say anything about skipping bytes.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think that wondering about the origin of this is mostly pointless apart from historical curiosity. It's an implementation issue, which seems to have leaked into the protocol definitions of things that have been built on top (incl. RFC8439 itself, which skips the second 32 byte of the chacha20 stream in the chacha20poly1305 cipher). Any protocol relying on it obviously can't just swap out this implementation as it'd be a protocol break, but other than that, either behavior can be implemented in function of either implementation (add a buffer on top in one direction, or introduce explicit skipping steps in the other).",

An alternative would be to just assert for the minimum size of 16 (and a maximum size of 32), if for some reason supporting keys with a length between 17 and 31 bytes is important; I guess it isn't though, it would also be confusing as the extra bytes wouldn't be used.",

To keep the diff minimal and to avoid having to change the callers, the length parameter is still kept right now; one option would be to change the parameter to a fixed-size type, e.g. something like `std::array<std::byte, 32>`.",

          "body": "Our implementation of ChaCha20 is based on [RFC 7539](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539) which has been declared obsolete by  [RFC 8439](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8439).\r\n\r\nFor example the nonce changed from 64-bit to 96-bit:\r\n> Note also that the original ChaCha had a 64-bit nonce and 64-bit block count. We have modified this here to be more consistent with recommendations in Section 3.2 of [RFC5116]. This limits the use of a single (key,nonce) combination to 2^32 blocks, or 256 GB, but that is enough for most uses. In cases where a single key is used by multiple senders, it is important to make sure that they don’t use the same nonces. This can be assured by partitioning the nonce space so that the first 32 bits are unique per sender, while the other 64 bits come from a counter.\r\n\r\nI have no idea if any of the changes are really material.\r\n\r\nGiven that we plan to use ChaCha20 in MuHash3072 (#19055), if we ever want to write an RFC for that, we should probably use the new version of ChaCha20.\r\n\r\nThis is also relevant for the [BIP-151 followup](https://gist.github.com/jonasschnelli/c530ea8421b8d0e80c51486325587c52), which appears also to based on RFC 7539. Since the original BIP151 is withdrawn and its replacement hasn't been proposed, it's not too late to change that. RFC 8439 also defines ChaCha20-Poly1305, at minimum the test vectors seem different.\r\n\r\nRFC 8439 has some [errata](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/rfc8439):\r\n* bug in Poly1305 pseudo code (2.5.1)\r\n* bug in ChaCha20 pseudo code (2.4.1)\r\n* remarks about constant-timeness for Poly1305",

It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

Both have their uses (in particular, the MuHash3072 code can benefit from multiple-of-64-bytes assumptions), plus the separation results in more readable code. Also, since FastRandomContext effectively had its own (more naive) caching on top of ChaCha20, that can be dropped in favor of ChaCha20's new built-in caching.\r\n\r\nI thought about rebasing #25712 on top of this, but the changes before are fairly extensive, so redid it instead.",
