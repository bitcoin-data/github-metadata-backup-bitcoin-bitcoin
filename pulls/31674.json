Credit TheCharlatan for noticing that it's missing.\r\n\r\nThis guards against 2 processes running with separate datadirs but the same blocksdir. I didn't add `walletdir` as I assume sqlite has us covered there.\r\n\r\nIt's not likely to happen currently, but may be more relevant in the future with applications using the kernel. Note that the kernel does not currently do any dir locking, but it should.",
