    "body": "Part of #30289.\r\n\r\nTxGraph's fundamental responsibility is deciding the order of transactions in the mempool. It relies on the `cluster_linearize.h` code to optimize it, but there can and often will be many different orderings that are essentially equivalent from a quality perspective, so we have to pick one. At a high level, the solution will involve one or more of:\r\n* Deciding based on **internal identifiers** (`Cluster::m_sequence`, `DepGraphIndex`). This is very simple, but risks leaking information about transaction receive order.\r\n* Deciding **randomly**, which is private, but may interfere with relay expectations, block propagation, and ability to monitor network behavior.\r\n* Deciding **based on txid**, which is private and deterministic, but risks incentivizing grinding to get an edge (though we haven't really seen such behavior).\r\n* Deciding **based on size** (e.g. prefer smaller transactions), which is somewhat related to quality, but not unconditionally (depending on mempool layout, the ideal ordering might call for smaller transactions first, last, or anywhere in between). It's also not a strong ordering as there can be many identically-sized transactions. However, if it were to encourage grinding behavior, incentivizing smaller transactions is probably not a bad thing.\r\n\r\nAs of #32545, the current behavior is primarily picking randomly, though inconsistently, as some code paths also use internal identifiers and size. #33335 sought to change it to use random (preferring size in a few places), with the downsides listed above.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an alternative to that, which changes the order to tie-break based on size everywhere possible, and use lowest-txid-first as final fallback. This is fully deterministic: for any given set of mempool transactions, if all linearized optimally, the transaction order exposed by TxGraph is deterministic.\r\n\r\nThe order of transactions within a chunk is tie-broken using:\r\n1. The output of `PostLinearize` (which improves sub-chunk order), using an initial linearization created using the rules 2-4 below.\r\n2. Individual transaction feerate (high to low)\r\n3. Individual transaction weight (small to large)\r\n4. Txid (low to high txid)\r\n\r\nThe order of chunks within a cluster is tie-broken using:\r\n1. Chunk feerate (high to low)\r\n2. Chunk weight (small to large)\r\n3. Max-txid (chunk with lowest maximum-txid first)\r\n\r\nThe order of chunks across clusters is tie-broken using:\r\n1. Feerate (high to low)\r\n2. Equal-feerate-chunk-prefix weight (small to large)\r\n3. Max-txid (chunk with lowest maximum-txid first)\r\n\r\nThe equal-feerate-chunk-prefix weight of a chunk C is defined as the sum of the weights of all chunks in the same cluster as C, with the same feerate as C, up to and including C itself, in linearization order (but excluding such chunks that appear after C). This is a well-defined approximation of sorting chunks from small to large across clusters, while remaining consistent with intra-cluster linearization order.\r\n",

      "body": "Both @darosior ([here](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2026-01-15#1187022;)) and @ajtowns ([here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33335#issuecomment-3757246246)) suggested preferring larger size over smaller size instead. I agree that this is also fine from an incentives perspective, because nobody is going to deliberately construct larger transactions at the same feerate - that's just paying more. If that is acceptable to you, you're better off just paying a higher feerate.\r\n\r\nFor ordering chunks across clusters, when combined with a greedy block building algorithm, larger first may have a slight advantage, because skipping a larger chunk still allows the smaller chunk to be considered. This does not work for chunks within a cluster, or transactions within a chunk. I don't think it matters much, but this could be simulated if we care.\r\n\r\n~~Practically however, I don't really see how to achieve this. For ordering chunks across clusters, we need some kind of function that maps chunks to a sorting key, with the property that it must map equal-feerate chunks within a cluster to increasing keys. The cross-cluster chunk ordering then boils down to sorting by increasing key. The PR here currently uses *(equal-feerate-chunk-prefix size, maximum txid within cluster)*, which will approximately prioritize smaller chunks (but it's a little murky when there are multiple equal-feerate chunks from the same cluster). I guess it's possible to use a key like sum of **inverses** of the sizes of all equal-feerate chunks in the same cluster, but that seems extremely ugly and only very approximate anyway.~~ EDIT: this is actually doable, see better idea [below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/34257#issuecomment-3760826877).\r\n\r\nFor ordering chunks within a cluster, or (if we ever consider a tx-granularity based block building algorithm rather than chunk-granularity) ordering transactions within a chunk, it occurs to me that we really want uniformity - get the chunk/tx boundaries density as uniform as possible, because realistically, every byte position has equal probability of ending up being a block limit, and we want to minimize the gap. This actually calls for something (pseudo)random, or maybe alternating between smallest and largest.\r\n\r\nThe only (very weak) argument in favor of smaller first that I know of, is that in a regime where mempools are reliably full, and transactions regularly get dropped/replaced, it may be better to have higher chunk/tx boundary density near the beginning, because the end has a non-negligible probability of never being mined at all, so it may pay off to deprioritize it.\r\n\r\nOverall, it is unlikely to matter I think, and having something is better than nothing. Remember that this is all just tie-breaking, which can't really guarantee any objective quality - that comes through chunking and linearizations that maximize feerates.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRe @ajtowns's comment there about grinding: I think it really boils down to me having a (perhaps irrational) dislike of using txid or any other not-objectively-relevant criterion in the sort order. It feels arbitrary, and possibly brittle if there ever is an incentive for something else equally arbitrary. It's setting a convention that at least in theory will have winners and losers, unlike feerate which is directly incentive-related, and even unlike size which at least intimately affects block building even if so in a rather chaotic way.\r\n\r\nSo I like having a size-based criterion in there first, because it reduces the impact of txid on the order to places where we're talking about equal-fee and equal-size transactions/chunks. But maybe it doesn't really matter...\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

Those were the points that came to mind when I considered the alternative 'wouldn't larger be better'-- though mostly in the sense of \"prefer the transaction that pays the greater absolute fees, among transactions at the same feerate\" which amounts to a prefer larger policy.\r\n\r\nI think a prior comment of mine pointed out that you could stick other criteria in ahead of the arbitrary one--  Total bitcoin being spent? the old priority metric? net change in utxo set size?  I don't have strong opinions.   These metrics, unlike grinding are kind of naturally self limiting. one only has so much bitcoin to spend, and so on.",

      "body": "The following approach could be used to get an approximate big-to-small chunk ordering.\r\n\r\nRather than summing the sizes of all equal-feerate chunks in a given cluster, **up to** the one under consideration, sum all of them **starting from** the one under consideration. Then sort by that metric decreasing.\r\n\r\nIt also doesn't need consistency with intra-cluster chunk order, or intra-chunk tx order. Those could still be small-to-large, though the effect of such a suffix-size based inter-chunk order is probably larger (if it is anything at all) if it's consistent with intra-cluster order.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdding additional criteria, after size (whether that's small first, or large first) is actually not hard with the approach used in this PR, because the fallback tiebreak after feerate and size is abstracted behind a \"fallback compare two transactions\" function provided by the mempool. Currently, that function compares txids, but it could be changed to compare other things like input amounts, input count, output count, age of inputs, ...\r\n",

I just read the thread as considering a size-based tie-breaker would necessarily pick smaller first, and couldn't find a good answer for \"why not higher absolute fees (larger size) instead?\".
