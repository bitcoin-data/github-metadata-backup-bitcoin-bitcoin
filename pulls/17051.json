If not, do you think it would be safe to change it? :)\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/376638afcf945ec43089625d115286594ce0ab16/src/key.h#L174-L183\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/78dae8caccd82cfbfd76557f1fb7d7557c7b5edb/src/pubkey.h#L240-L249\r\n\r\nFWIW the code paths in question are reachable by the fuzzers added in PR #17051 (\"tests: Add deserialization fuzzing harnesses\").",
