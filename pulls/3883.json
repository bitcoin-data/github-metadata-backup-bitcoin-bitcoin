    "body": "Rebased version of [#3354](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3354).\n\nInstead of dropping double-spend transactions, relay them to peers.  This is crucial to allowing all parts of the network to detect double-spend attempts as quickly as possible, i.e. reducing the \"confirmation\" time for buying coffee to a time on par with credit card transactions.  Only the first respend seen is relayed.\n\nI successfully completed a primary test running 3 copies of bitcoin-qt in regtest mode with this patch applied, connected in a **node1-newtorknode-node2** configuration.\n\nI used the rawtransaction API for steps 2 and 3, but with -salvagewallet and a single funding transaction, tests would be possible that did not require rawtransactions.\n\nStill TODO: Regression test plan\n\nPrimary Test Details\nStep 1\n- Send transaction from node1 to a node2 address\n- \\* Transaction **is relayed** through networknode, to node2\n- \\* Transaction appears in node2 wallet\n\nStep 2\n- Restart node1 with -salvagewallet (so it forgets about 1st spend)\n- Send new transaction using same input (first double-spend), using rawtransaction API\n- \\* Transaction **is relayed** through networknode, to node2\n- \\* node2 does not accept the double-spend into its mempool and it does not appear in node2 wallet\n\nStep 3\n- Restart node1 with -salvagewallet again\n- Send transaction using same input (second double spend), using rawtransaction API\n- \\* Transaction **is not relayed** through networknode\n\nStep 4\nOne more test for good measure\n- Restart node1 with -salvagewallet again\n- Using regular UI (not rawtransaction API), send entire wallet balance to node2 (third double spend).  This included additional inputs besides the spent one.\n- \\* Transaction **is not relayed** through networknode\n",

The network regularly takes more than an hour to confirm a transaction, just because of block-finding variability.\n",

      "body": "Also, now that I've actually looked at the code, I see two implementation-specific DoS attacks above and beyond the problems fundamental to this idea:\n\n1) The double-spent transactions don't end up in the mempool, so they fail AlreadyHave() in the \"inv\" message processing. Since we don't have them, next stop is pfrom->AskFor(inv), which adds them to the size-limited mapAlreadyAskedFor. Unfortunately that is limited to 50,000 entries, so if it rolls over we'll waste bandwidth re-asking for those double-spending transactions all over again. This shouldn't be too much of an issue, as we wouldn't resend those transactions, but...\n\n2) Because the double-spend detection is based on a bloom filter which is cleared with 1/1000 probability on every hit if I have enough double-spends to exceed that limit, and subsequently the percolation threshold of the network, I can re-double-spend outputs over and over again. Or even worse, nodes in the network might resend those transactions in a big loop if things get bogged down enough and the attack will self-propagate.\n\n@dgenr8 So do us all a favor and add a simple rate-limiter to the RelayDoubleSpend() function. You can copy the design of the free transaction rate limiter. (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5b6e9811fa64540c8feecc24f11fa867392f262f/src/main.cpp#L912) Make sure you make that rate limiter adjustable by a command-line option.\n\n@gavinandresen Notice how this is a good example of why actually testing against real attacks is valuable.\n",

Finney attack, and the fact that miners already do not mine the first spend seen (~all mine the first that they accepted, not seen, and there is already some hashpower that mines highest fees).\n\nThis kind of bad argument makes me uncomfortable and it makes it harder for me to objectively evaluate the implementation on its own merits when I know its proponents are exaggerating its benefits.\n",

State depends on node startup moment and subsequent respend traffic seen.  Perhaps the first clear() should be randomized to occur after U(500,1500) insertions or something like that.\n",

That is time enough for the bettor to have learned he lost, and transmitted the \"undo\" respend with higher fee.\n\nWhile a regular merchant doesn't have to worry about paying out winnings, he also doesn't have the luxury of his product being a bitcoin payout that can be made a child of the original bet, as these gambling services do.\n",

Why they have decided to make their service less secure is unknown to me and I won't be surprised if they go back to the more secure behavior.\n\nDo note BTW that since Eligius does not accept satoshidice bets into their mempool you can always double-spend them with ~10% probability, something this relay and alert patch is inherently unable to prevent.\n",

Getting point-to-point connections to stay up in the long run is surprisingly difficult due to how the DoS rules/connection limits of Bitcoin work. Much easier if you either just run two nodes yourself and explicitly connect to either. You'll know it's working if getpeerinfo shows peers with services \"04000001\"\n\nBesides, I did say above that I think this patch opens up DoS attack vulnerabilities - I have no desire to be running insecure software. :)\n",

      "body": "@dgenr8 The doublespend proof \"blow-up\" issue is pretty fundamental - I can double spend with a 100K (or heck, ~1MB) transaction and now the network has to propagate a bunch of useless data. My other concerns were just implementation specific mistakes that made that fundamental issue even worse.\n\nBetter to stick with proving double-spends by showing specific inputs were double-spent, and then on top of that using a custom payment protocol that guarantees things like never reusing addresses. (not unlike how I suspect any scorched earth implementation really needs to be its own payment protocol separate from normal transactions)\n\nAnyway, I've got no desire to waste a bunch of bandwidth DoS attacking the network on someone else's behalf. Seems you've got a connection to a replace-by-fee node through somewhere anyway - my double-spends I'm creating as part of my 1% reward for implementing replace-by-fee experiment(1) are showing up now. (I count 9 running on the network right now; I'm running 3 of those)\n\n1) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=645120.0\n",

(at least until the payment goes through) To be able to add fees, sign with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY.\n\n2) Make double-spend relaying only relay a single double-spending scriptSig + list of SignatureHash() outputs. (to show signatures are valid) This is max 10KB of data, even for a non-standard tx double-spend proof.\n\n3) ...notice that you've implemented the double-spend notification I need for scorched earth to work. :) Also having a payment protocol for it makes it easy to do things like have the user put up more than the actual payment as a risk deposit.

      "body": ".... until he runs out of coins to double spend, unless the network is fast enough that it doesn't matter or unless businesses react to a flood of double spend alerts by temporarily pausing their operations, etc.\n\nI'm very wary of adversarial scenarios where people try to anticipate all the way to the end game. I've seen this sort of discussion before, back when my old team first proposed the Google anti-hijacking system. Indulge me in a quick story. Spammers had found ways to obtain millions of correct passwords and were logging in to people's email accounts, to send spam to their friends.  So that was the problem. We proposed to try and solve it using risk analysis and asking additional questions at login time when possible. \n\nNeedless to say we got lots and lots of negative feedback about this idea. It'll never work. You'll break the login system. Users won't accept it. Hackers will just log in from the same country as the users do and then you won't be able to spot them. Even if you do, they'll just switch to using old protocols like SMTP and IMAP where you can't ask for more than the password, and then it'll be game over. Users should just all use two-factor logins, anything else is a waste of time. Everyone being hacked is the future, it's inevitable, don't fight it. Etc.\n\nAll of these were great points made by smart people. Some of them we didn't have good answers for. We proceeded anyway, partly because we got paid to fight spam and just resigning from our jobs didn't seem like an option :) \n\nAnyway, end of the story: we did beat them. It turned out that even though there were a lot of different groups doing this kind of hacking they were not infinite and they were not invincible. A lot of the original justifications for why we would fail were based on faulty assumptions that weren't obvious at the time. For example, that attackers were infinitely smart, capable, didn't make mistakes, had unlimited time and endless motivation.  Another more subtle assumption was that our current set of tactics was the entire possible set; that we wouldn't invent or discover anything new, even though we did.\n\nIf we'd listened to those smart people back then, we'd have never started and thus never have succeeded.\n\nI don't know if this situation is analogous, I just know that it's very easy to think you can anticipate everything, that there's no point in playing defence because, \"I'm sure I could beat myself so why bother\". We shouldn't fall into that trap. In this case, I think the DoS issues are resolved as best we can with our current framework (i.e. not that great but it can improve in future), so the most harm that can occur here is that we do lose this first round, people ignore the alerts and the community ends up back in the same situation it's currently in. Not so terrible, really.\n",

      "body": "@sipa Agreed. And you know, basically you can say the difference between my \"relay the scriptSig\" proposal - which you also deserve credit for IIRC - and the \"relay the whole tx\" proposal is that the whole tx version requires about 100x more bandwidth to defend against an attacker.\n\nWe could do even better than that though and implement a \"relay the scriptSig\" double-spend alert scheme where the size of the scriptSig we'll relay was limited. Basically we'd only be making useful promises about scriptPubKey's that can only be redeemed with small scriptSigs - ~500 bytes should be fine for 99.9% of transactions. In that case per txout you can only get the network to relay another 500 bytes of data max, which is only about 5-10x the bandwidth creating the txout caused in the first place. Perfectly acceptable and keeps this feature from getting abused as a replacement for BitMessage.\n",

In recent versions, AcceptToMemoryPool returns false after detecting a respend, and does not flag an error in the validation state.\n\nOne effect is that it won't contribute to a peer ban.  Another is that the peer does not get feedback about the rejection.  I suggested adding a rejection code in response to #4057. But, to your point, the simple version of that change would have the effect of increasing traffic via the rejection network message.  Whether it contributed to peer banning would depend on the nDoS value chosen.\n",

If each double-spend is relayed only once, we have only doubled the attackers DoS capabilities, which imho is completely tolerable. \n\nRegarding allowing transaction replacements: a tx should be allowed to be replaced as long as it has one more input than the replaced (all the rest match), and the new input amount is higher than the required fees. Simple and effective. Allows to overwrite txs hanging forever. No child-pay-parent mess.\n\nImplementing both of them require 5 lines of code, at most.\n",

That's a pretty good reason because nodes do not know if miners will include the large or the small one. There is no easy way out this problem.\n\nAs Peter proposed, a minimal double-spend alert could be achieved using scriptsigs.\nI did the same proposal long ago here\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=106026.msg1162636#msg1162636\n\nSo I vote to give Peter's proposal a second thought, I don't like the complexity of the bloom/rate-filter.  \n",

If they saw B and then A first, it doesn't matter what order you relay in. I don't see how it affects the likelihood of changing the perceived order for any transaction. Could you try explaining that again?\n\nAnother way to implement this is to make the double spend relay not a \"tx\" message but a \"dtx\" message. Core can treat them identically, other nodes will ignore them, and it's I think easier to see that the behaviour of the network should not change.\n",

You cannot assume intent behind a double spend.\n\nEasy counter examples:\n- User's transaction got relayed, but is stuck in limbo (not confirming) due to insufficient fees or some other factor.  Fix is usually to double spend with higher fees.\n- Payment channel (smart contract).  User's refund TX races with payment channel rapidly-revised TX in at least one edge case.  Refund transactions intentionally spend the same inputs as the rapidly-revised TX, to guarantee only one is valid.\n- https://github.com/jgarzik/auctionpunk/ is another example of the common pattern of relying on X transactions to spend the same input(s), to guarantee that only one-of-N is valid.\n\nThere are valid cases for double spending, and you simply do not have information sufficient to judge a \"good\" versus \"evil\" double spend.\n\nLet's dispense with the \"no situations under Bitcoin's current design\" hokem right now.  One-of-N determination is a key use of the Bitcoin protocol -- including protocols you've helped design.\n",

      "body": "@jgarzik Replace by fee isn't supposed to work, the fact that it does is a regrettable bug that we must work on, indeed this patch is part of doing that. And if a merchant sold something and then the tx was replaced-by-fee then that would certainly count as a form of payment fraud, no different to passing a bouncing cheque or forged paper currency. The fact that cheques can bounce and paper currency can be forged doesn't mean it's an intentional part of their design.\n\nIn payment channels the refund isn't supposed to be used unless one side has hung up/gone away. If the refund is used simultaneous with the last best signed tx, then one side or the other is attempting an attack _or_ has come back online simultaneous with the channel closing and there's been a byzantine communication failure of some kind (mistake). \n\nI don't know about the auctionpunk case, I haven't seen how that works. I'll take your word for it that this is a case where you want semi-random (?) resolution of which transaction is the winner.\n\n@petertodd What do you think the white paper is if not an explanation of the design? The fact that our implementation doesn't always meet the design goals doesn't mean there's no design.\n\nW.R.T mempool resource uniformity, that's certainly something we'll want to tackle in future, if we end up with mempools routinely overflowing. But if we go overcapacity like that I'd expect the transactions that are constantly losing to eventually go away. There's no point in using Bitcoin in such a way that you know you'll constantly fail to obtain the supply of the service you need. The mismatch should end up being manageable.\n",

It is effective field advice because the \"stuck\" transaction usually hasn't propagated well and made it to miners, and it provides 100% guarantee that the other version of the transaction will never confirm.\n\nThis is not some deployed and argued-about \"replace by fee\" policy but a standard workaround for the \"stuck in limbo\" problem that is as old as bitcoin itself.\n\nRE mempool uniformity and synchronization, this is a topic of open debate.\n\nRE mempool overflowing, there are already designs (#3723) and PRs (#3753) that address such issues without any need to resort to any sort of explicit mempool uniformity scheme.\n",

      "body": "@jgarzik Agreed. Anyway I'll see if I can get some time to write up a better patch after I get home if no-one else is going to write one. \n\n@mikehearn Replace-by-fee scorched-earth can be viewed as a proposed way of meeting that white paper's design goals; coinbase reallocation/blacklisting is another way. Greenaddress's double-spend guarantees is yet another way. \n\nWhich idea(s) are best remains to be seen, but if I can make replace-by-fee effective with a few reddit/bitcointalk posts and a few hundred dollars budget that suggests that designs that assume it doesn't exist are insecure. Meanwhile the community, research and otherwise, has rejected a whole host of miner level approaches to double-spending quite thoroughly.\n\nOn 2 July 2014 11:50:26 CEST, Mike Hearn notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @jgarzik Replace by fee isn't supposed to work, the fact that it does\n> is a regrettable bug that we must work on, indeed this patch is part of\n> doing that.

If we have two transactions tx1 and tx2 that spend the same outpoints, you must, today, be able to handle receiving 'inv' and 'tx' data for both of them.\n\nThe only change this makes is that you might now get the inv/tx messages from the same peer instead of different peers. Are there implementations that care about which peer sends them which transaction data?\n\nRE: 'dtx' message:  Same argument as above. The reference implementation doesn't care where transaction data comes from, and it MUST be able to handle double-spends.\n\nRE: writing up a better patch:  okey dokey.  Better is better.\n",
