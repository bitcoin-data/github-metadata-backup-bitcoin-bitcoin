Once this one done, it should ease work to wipe out more cs_main locks from wallet code.\r\n\r\nI think it's ready for a first round of review before to get further.\r\n\r\n- `BlockUntilSyncedToCurrent` : restrain isPotentialTip to isTip because we want to be sure that wallet see BlockDisconnected callbacks if its height differs from the Chain one. It means during a reorg, an RPC could return before the BlockDisconnected callback had been triggered. This could cause a tx that had been included in the disconnected block to be displayed as confirmed, for example.\r\n\r\n~~- `AbandonTransaction` : in case of conflicted tx (nIndex = -1), we set its m_block_height to the one of conflicting blocks, but if this height is superior to CWallet::m_last_block_processed_height, that means tx isn't conflicted anymore so we return 0 as tx is again unconfirmed~~ After #16624, we instead rely on Confirmation. \r\n\r\n~~- `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe`: in case of block disconnected, transactions are added to mempool again, so we need to replace old txn in `mapWallet` with a height set to zero so we remove check on block_hash.IsNull~~ Already done in #16624 ",
