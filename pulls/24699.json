    "body": "While running my coin selection simulations, I noticed that towards the end of the simulation, the wallet would become slow to make new transactions. The wallet generally performs much more slowly when there are a large number of transactions and/or a large number of keys. The improvements here are focused on wallets with a large number of transactions as that is what the simulations produce.\r\n\r\nMost of the slowdown I observed was due to `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::GetSigningProvider` re-deriving keys every time it is called. To avoid this, it will now cache the `SigningProvider` produced so that repeatedly fetching the `SigningProvider` for the same script will not result in the same key being derived over and over. This has a side effect of making the function non-const, which makes a lot of other functions non-const as well. This helps with wallets with lots of address reuse (as my coin selection simulations are), but not if addresses are not reused as keys will end up needing to be derived the first time `GetSigningProvider` is called for a script.\r\n\r\nThe `GetSigningProvider` problem was also exacerbated by unnecessarily fetching a `SigningProvider` for the same script multiple times. A `SigningProvider` is retrieved to be used inside of `IsSolvable`. A few lines later, we use `GetTxSpendSize` which fetches a `SigningProvider` and then calls `CalculateMaximumSignedInputSize`. We can avoid a second call to `GetSigningProvider` by using `CalculateMaximumSignedInputSize` directly with the `SigningProvider` already retrieved for `IsSolvable`.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional slowdown where `ProduceSignature` with a dummy signer is called twice for each output. The first time is `IsSolvable` checks that `ProduceSignature` succeeds, thereby informing whether we have solving data. The second is `CalculateMaximumSignedInputSize` which returns -1 if `ProduceSignature` fails, and returns the input size otherwise. We can reduce this to one call of `ProduceSignature` by using `CalculateMaximumSignedInputSize`'s result to set `solvable`.\r\n\r\nLastly, a lot of time is spent looking in `mapWallet` and `mapTxSpends` to determine whether an output is already spent. The performance of these lookups is slightly improved by changing those maps to use `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_multimap` respectively.",

          "title": "wallet: avoid mixing different `OutputTypes` during coin selection",
          "body": "# Concept\r\n\r\nFollowing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23789, Bitcoin Core wallet will now generate a change address that matches the payment address type. This improves privacy by not revealing which of the outputs is the change at the time of the transaction in scenarios where the input address types differ from the payment address type. However, information about the change can be leaked in a later transaction. This proposal attempts to address that concern.\r\n\r\n## Leaking information in a later transaction\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n![mix input types(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7444140/158597086-788339b0-c698-4b60-bd45-9ede4cd3a483.png)\r\n\r\n1. Alice has a wallet with bech32 type UTXOs and pays Bob, who gives her a P2SH address\r\n2. Alice's wallet generates a P2SH change output, preserving her privacy in `txid: a`\r\n3. Alice then pays Carol, who gives her a bech32 address\r\n4. Alice's wallet combines the P2SH UTXO with a bech32 UTXO and `txid: b` has two bech32 outputs\r\n\r\nFrom a chain analysis perspective, it is reasonable to infer that the P2SH input in `txid: b` was the change from `txid: a`. To avoid leaking information in this scenario, Alice's wallet should avoid picking the P2SH output and instead fund the transaction with only bech32 Outputs. If the payment to Carol can be funded with just the P2SH output, it should be preferred over the bech32 outputs as this will convert the P2SH UTXO to bech32 UTXOs via the payment and change outputs of the new transaction.\r\n\r\n**TLDR;** Avoid mixing output types, spend non-default `OutputTypes` when it is economical to do so.\r\n\r\n# Approach\r\n\r\n`AvailableCoins` now populates a struct, which makes it easier to access coins by `OutputType`. Coin selection tries to find a funding solution by each output type and chooses the most economical by waste metric. If a solution can't be found without mixing, coin selection runs over the entire wallet, allowing mixing, which is the same as the current behavior.\r\n\r\nI've also added a functional test (`test/functional/wallet_avoid_mixing_output_types.py`) and unit test (`src/wallet/test/availablecoins_tests.cpp`.",

          "title": "wallet, spkm: Move key management from DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to wallet level KeyManager",
          "body": "This PR changes DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to no longer handle relevant keys directly. Instead all keys for all DescriptorSPKMs will be handled by a new `KeyManager` class which exists within `CWallet` (a reference to it is passed to each DescriptorSPKM). This allows us to have a concept of a wallet HD key for descriptor wallets. This makes it easier to add new single key descriptors that use the same HD master key as the rest of the autogenerated descriptors (e.g. for taproot). Multisigs will also be easier as an xpub belonging to the wallet can be exported without needing to do weird things like descriptor introspection and guessing about which descriptor's key to use.\r\n\r\n`KeyManager` is a class which handles all of the keys for DescriptorSPKMs. It contains the maps that hold the keys, deals with writing those keys to disk, and handles their encryption. Encryption keys are still managed by `CWallet` but provided to `KeyManager` through the `WalletStorage` interface. Signing is still done through `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::SignTransaction` however this will fetch the keys from `KeyManager` rather than storing keys in the DescriptorSPKM to be used.\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards compatible. Although `KeyManager` writes and uses keys in new `keyman_key` and `keyman_ckey` records, it will still write keys for each descriptor in `walletdescriptorkey` and `walletdescriptorckey` records. This allows a descriptor wallet created using this change to be opened by 22.0 and 0.21. Additionally, wallets created with older software will automatically be upgraded to using the `KeyManager` at first loading. This is done in the background and does not require any user interaction (i.e. no passphrase required).",

          "body": "Depends on #26728.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new wallet RPC `getxpub`. It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

The specification has been otherwise unrevised since publication nearly a year and half ago.\r\n\r\nMinus tests and deployment, it's about 180 LOC.\r\n\r\nThis branch activates against regtest so you can test on your local node.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes standardness rules for a bare single CTV Hash script, which has applications for congestion control. Other than that there is limited support for bare scripts using CTV, although the patches to #16766 lay the groundwork for better wallet support with proper IsTrusted parents scanning, which can be amended later to handle chains of irrefutable transactions.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about the design of BIP-119 at https://utxos.org/. In particular I recommend the workshop transcript and slides https://utxos.org/workshops/ for a thorough review of how CTV works.\r\n\r\nYou can stress test CTV for complex examples by trying out the Sapio compiler: learn.sapio-lang.org. There is also some support for CTV in miniscript via the [Sapio Rust Miniscript Fork](https://github.com/sapio-lang/rust-miniscript). \r\n\r\nDiscussion welcome at ##ctv-bip-review in Libera.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to connect to a signet, I operate one you can connect to with the parameters below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[signet]\r\nsignetchallenge=512102946e8ba8eca597194e7ed90377d9bbebc5d17a9609ab3e35e706612ee882759351ae \r\naddnode=50.18.75.225\r\n```\r\nYou may also wish to have the below parameters for things to work nicely:\r\n```\r\nserver = 1\r\ntxindex=1\r\nrpcport=18332\r\nrpcworkqueue=1000\r\nfallbackfee=0.0002\r\nminrelaytxfee=0\r\n```",

          "body": "This started in #24845 but grew out of scope of it. \r\n\r\nSo, points tackled:\r\n\r\n1) Avoid extra `GetWalletTx` lookups inside `AvailableCoins -> IsSpentKey`.\r\n    `IsSpentKey` was receiving the tx hash and index to internally lookup the tx inside the wallet's map. As all the `IsSpentKey` function callers already have the wtx available, them can provide the `scriptPubKey` directly.\r\n\r\n2) Most of the time, we call `Wallet::AvailableCoins`, and later on the process, skip the non-spendable coins from the result in subsequent for-loops. So to speedup the process: introduced the ability to filter by \"only_spendable\" coins inside `Wallet::AvailableCoins` directly.\r\n(the non-spendable coins skip examples are inside `AttemptSelection->GroupOutputs` and `GetAvailableBalance`).\r\n\r\n4) Refactored `AvailableCoins` in several ways:\r\n\r\n   a) Now it will return a new struct `CoinsResult` instead of receiving the vCoins vector reference (which was being cleared at the beginning of the method anyway). --> this is coming from #24845 but cherry-picked it here too to make the following commits look nicer.\r\n\r\n   b) Unified all the 'wtx.tx->vout[I]' calls into a single call (coming from this comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24699#discussion_r854163032). \r\n\r\n5) The wallet `IsLockedCoin` and `IsSpent` methods now accept an `OutPoint` instead of a hash:index. Which let me cleanup a bunch of extra code.\r\n\r\n6) Speeded up the wallet 'GetAvailableBalance': filtering `AvailableCoins` by spendable outputs only and using the 'AvailableCoins' retrieved `total_amount` instead of looping over all the retrieved coins once more.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSide topic, all this process will look even nicer with #25218",

          "body": "Seeking to make the `CoinControl` options less confusing/redundant.\r\nIt should have no functional changes.\r\n\r\nThe too long to read technical description; remove `m_add_inputs`, we can use the already existent `fAllowOtherInputs` flag.\r\n\r\nIn #16377 the `CoinControl` flag ‘m_add_inputs’ was added to tell the coin filtering and selection process two things:\r\n- Coin Filtering: Only use the provided inputs. Skip the Rest.\r\n- Coin Selection: Search the wtxs-outputs and append all the `CoinControl` internal and external selected outpoints to the selection result (skipping all the available output checks). Nothing else.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in `CoinControl` we already have a flag ‘fAllowOtherInputs’ which is already saying:\r\n- Coin Filtering: Only use the provided inputs. Skip the Rest.\r\n- Coin Selection: If false, no selection process -> append all the `CoinControl` selected outpoints to the selection result (while they passed all the `AvailableCoins` checks and are available in the 'vCoins' vector).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nAs can notice, the first point in the coin filtering process is duplicated in the two option flags. And the second one, is slightly different merely because it takes into account whether the coin is on the `AvailableCoins` vector or not.\r\nSo it makes sense to merge ‘m_add_inputs’ and ‘fAllowOtherInputs’ into a single field for the coin filtering process while introduce other changes to add the missing/skipped internal and external coins into 'vCoins' vector if they were manually selected by the user.\r\n\r\n——————————————————————————————————\r\n\r\nJust as an extra note:\r\nOn top of this, I’m working on unifying/untangling further the coin filtering and selection processes so we have less duplicate functionality in both processes.",

This benchmark aims to ensure us that, at least, there are no regressions (obviously performance improvements are great but, at least for me, this heads into the direction of having a base metric to compare future structural changes).\r\n\r\n#### Implementation Notes\r\n\r\nThere are 5 new benchmarks, one per wallet supported output type (LEGACY, P2SH_SEGWIT, BECH32, BECH32M), plus a multi-output-type wallet benchmark which contains outputs from all the descriptor types.\r\n\r\nThe test, by default, fills-up the wallet with 1k transactions, 2k outputs. Mainly to not consume much time if the user just want to verify that no substantial regressions were introduced. But, my expectation for those who are focused on this process is to use a much higher number locally to really note the differences across commits.",

So, if the tx creation fails, it's not available inside `WalletModel::prepareTransaction` to be able to throw the `AmountWithFeeExceedsBalance` .\r\n\r\nThis PR re-implements the feature properly, inside `createTransaction` and add test coverage for it.",

However, we already do that in order to get\nthe size of the input by using CalculateMaximumSignedInputSize. As this\nfunction returns -1 if ProduceSignature fails, we can just remove the\nuse of IsSolvable and check that input_bytes is not -1 to determine\nthe solvability of an output.",

          "body": "I maintain a [wallet](https://github.com/bitcoinhodler/GlacierProtocol/tree/bitcoin-core-24) that uses `bitcoin-cli` for signing transactions, and its test system uses regtest to create a bunch of UTXOs for the signing tests to sign. These tests use a git-committed `wallet.dat` that is copied into the newly-created `datadir` before launching `bitcoind`.\r\n\r\nFor years, up until bc886fcb31e1afa7bbf7b86bfd93e51da7076ccf (part of #24699), this was stable and worked well. Occasionally I would need to recreate all the transactions when this project changed mining (#24732) or coin selection (#24584) but I could handle that.\r\n\r\nWhat I can't handle is having the generated transactions be different each time I run the exact same sequence of `bitcoin-cli` commands starting from the same `wallet.dat`. Starting with bc886fcb31e1afa7bbf7b86bfd93e51da7076ccf, that's what happens.\r\n\r\nIs this a supported use model, or is it unreasonable to expect this to be stable?\r\n\r\nSummarizing:\r\n* v0.20.0 -- stable\r\n* v0.21.0 -- stable\r\n* v22.0 -- stable\r\n* v23.0 -- stable\r\n* 272356024db978c92112167f8d8e4cc62adad63d (which is bc886fcb31e1afa7bbf7b86bfd93e51da7076ccf^) -- stable\r\n* bc886fcb31e1afa7bbf7b86bfd93e51da7076ccf -- unstable\r\n* v24.0rc2 -- unstable\r\n* Current master (f37bd15d472fdc7dd3d40cafaba9e8dfddd6b530) -- unstable\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the issue -->\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe generated transactions should be identical given an identical series of `bitcoin-cli` calls.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nThe generated transactions choose different input coins from the regtest blockchain every time I run.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nIn my [Glacier wallet fork](https://github.com/bitcoinhodler/GlacierProtocol/tree/bitcoin-core-24), run `t/online_regtest_wallet.py recreate-all-tests`; git commit the result. Run the same command again -- `git status` should show no changes.\r\n\r\nWhen it's unstable, dozens of files change.\r\n\r\n**System information**\r\n\r\nRunning on Whonix 16. Building inside the git repo as such:\r\n```\r\n(cd depends && make -j4 NO_QT=1) && ./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu && make -j4\r\n```",
