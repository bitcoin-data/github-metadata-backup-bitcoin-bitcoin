    "body": "This PR is a late follow-up to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27432, introducing an option for the utxo-to-sqlite script to store the txid/scriptPubKey columns as bytes (= `BLOB` storage class in sqlite, see e.g. https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html in sqlite) rather than hex strings. This was proposed in earlier reviews (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27432#issuecomment-1516857024, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27432#issuecomment-1653739351) and has the obvious advantage of a significantly smaller size of the resulting database (and with that, faster conversion) and the avoidance of hex-to-bytes conversion for further processing of the data [1]. The rationale on why hex strings were chosen back then (and still stays the default, if only for compatibility reasons) is laid out in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27432#issuecomment-1516922824 [2].\r\n\r\nThe approach taken is introducing new parameters `--spk` and `--txid` which can either have the values \"hex\", \"raw\" (for scriptpubkey) and \"hex\", \"raw\", \"rawle\" (for txid). Thanks to ajtowns for providing this suggestion. Happy to take further inputs on naming and thoughts on future extensibility etc.\r\n\r\n[1] For a concrete example, I found that having these columns as bytes would be nice while working on a SwiftSync hints generator tool (https://github.com/theStack/swiftsync-hints-gen), which takes the result of the utxo-to-sqlite tool as input.\r\n[2] note that in contrast what I wrote back then, I think there is no ambiguity on byte-string-serialization of txids; they are ultimately just hash results and hence, they should be stored as such, and adding a big/little endian knob wouldn't make much sense. The drawback of not being able to immediately show txid-strings (as one would need to do the bytes-reversal step first, which is not possible in sqlite, see e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1165499803) still remains though.",

      "body": "> The approach taken is introducing a `-m`/`--mode` parameter which can either have the values \"hex\" (default) or \"bytes\". Happy to take suggestions on naming and thoughts on future extensibility etc.\r\n\r\nI wonder if separate options would be better, eg `--spk=raw --txid=raw`?\r\n \r\n> I think there is no ambiguity on byte-string-serialization of txids; they are ultimately just hash results and hence, they should be stored as such, and adding a big/little endian knob wouldn't make much sense.\r\n\r\nI think it will be surprising if `hex(txid)` gives \"reversed\" values so that just copy and pasting into block explorers doesn't work. If you did separate flags, you could consider `--txid=hex`, `--txid=raw` (same byte order as hex), and `--txid=rawhash` (same byte order as sha256 output) as separate options, maybe?\r\n\r\nHere's a patch: https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commit/d1fc5dff9afc2c05aa975fa7b29c029865d77507\r\n\r\nCould consider allowing `--spk=none --txid=none` to drop both fields for further space saving if you're just analysing the utxo set, not doing things with it (or `--txid=counter` to replace the actual txid with a counter that saves space but still lets you notice when utxos are from the same tx).\r\n\r\n> The drawback of not being able to immediately show txid-strings (as one would need to do the bytes-reversal step first, which is not possible in sqlite, see e.g. [#24952 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1165499803)) still remains though.\r\n\r\nSeems like you can get [addons](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/0.27.2/docs/text.md#text_reverse) for this, for whatever that's worth.",

      "body": "@ajtowns: Thanks for your suggestions, I like the idea of having more flexibility and mostly agree with the naming. Took your patch (TIL about [argparse `choices`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#choices)) and adapted the functional test accordingly, to exercise all combinations of new options. As for txid format option naming, I think I'd intuitively prefer `raw` for storing them in the hash order, since that's AFAICT the most common txid byte-string serialization (I think I haven't encountered any counter-examples so far in the Bitcoin ecosystem) -- but then one would need to pick a good name for the \"reverse-hash\" byte-string serialization again. So maybe it's just fine :man_shrugging:  Personally, with the current naming, I'd only either wanted to use the combinations `--txid=hex --spk=hex` (i.e. the default, the only possible on master), or `--txid=rawhash --spk=raw`.\r\n\r\n> Could consider allowing --spk=none --txid=none to drop both fields for further space saving if you're just analysing the utxo set, not doing things with it (or --txid=counter to replace the actual txid with a counter that saves space but still lets you notice when utxos are from the same tx).\r\n\r\nPretty neat ideas, and potentially useful for e.g. dust (and other \"spam\") or output script type analysis. Will consider for further follow-ups.",

Force-pushed accordingly. I'm  fine with both though, so if other reviewers / potential users of that script feel strongly on `rawhash`/`raw`, I'm happy to revert.\r\n\r\n> For future consideration `--spk=type` so that it only records whether the spk was p2pk, p2pkh, p2sh, p2wpkh, p2wsh, p2tr, p2a, or other would probably be interesting.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK. I think there is room for some bike-shedding on details, like e.g. do we split up p2pk into uncompressed and compressed (or, god forbid, even hybrid?) or whether bare multisig should also be a category (if at all, then probably only with a very weak detection like \"first byte is in range OP_1...OP_16, last byte is OP_CHECKMULTISIG\", as implementing the [full detection as used in Solver](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/88b22acc3d6faeb2c0860695783a2a082d4c8098/src/script/solver.cpp#L85-L105) seems overblown for a conversion script). But, something to discuss in another PR anyways.",
