      "body": "> For MacOs (15.3.1 M4 pro) , I have llvm 19 which is also a known [issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31049) so I generally have to specify my commands with this to use llvm 18.\r\n\r\nIs this issue specific to building the fuzz tests, or just a general issue? From your command, it seems like it is a general issue. In this case, I wonder if it makes sense to mention here that all binaries (`clang`, `clang++`, `llvm-cov`, `llvm-profdata`) will have to be called via `$(brew --prefix llvm@18)/bin/__binary_name__`?",
