      "body": "The `-O` flag controls optimization level, which shouldn't have any impact on the AST representation of the code. The compiler builds an AST representation of the code that corresponds to the semantics of the program, and from that generates LLVM IR that implements those semantics. This is then passed on to the optimizer, which performs transformations on the LLVM IR representation (not the AST directly) to produce equivalent but more efficient LLVM IR.\r\n\r\nThis is much simplified, but if code coverage is implemented based on the AST representation, then I do agree that `-O` flags shouldn't matter. That being said, I have a hard time imagining how each line in the final IR can always be attributed to the correct line in the original sources in the presence of optimizations like inlining and especially outlining, where the same executable code may be used to implement source-different functions. But if the documentation says it, I would go with that.",

I am sure that not cleaning it will lead to more issues down the line (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31942). Maybe the `rm` could be dropped, if each differing configuration was put into a different folder, similar to the cmake presets in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c0b7159de47592c95c6db061de682b4af4058102/CMakePresets.json#L64.\r\n\r\nNo strong opinion, but leaving the `rm` for now, as it is harmless and possibly helpful, seems fine. No need to invalidate acks, but if it is important to remove, it could be done in a follow-up.",
