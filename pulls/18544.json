    "body": "This PR fixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18483. On the master branch, there is currently _always_ a BIP37 filter set for every peer: if not a specific filter is set through a `filterload` message, a default match-everything filter is instanciated and pointed to via the `CBloomFilter` default constructor; that happens both initially, when the containing structure `TxRelay` is constructed: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c0b389b33516fb3eaaad7c30bd11dba768882a7e/src/net.h#L812\r\n\r\nand after a loaded filter is removed again through a `filterclear` message:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c0b389b33516fb3eaaad7c30bd11dba768882a7e/src/net_processing.cpp#L3201\r\n\r\nThe behaviour was introduced by commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/37c6389c5a0ca63ae3573440ecdfe95d28ad8f07 (an intentional covert fix for [CVE-2013-5700](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18515), according to gmaxwell).\r\n\r\nThis default match-everything filter leads to some unintended side-effects:\r\n1. `getdata` request for filtered blocks (i.e. type `MSG_FILTERED_BLOCK`) are always responded to with `merkleblock`s, even if no filter was set by the peer, see issue #18483 (strictly speaking, this is a violation of BIP37) https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c0b389b33516fb3eaaad7c30bd11dba768882a7e/src/net_processing.cpp#L1504-L1507\r\n2. if a peer sends a `filteradd` message without having loaded a filter via `filterload` before, the intended increasing of the banscore never happens (triggered if `bad` is set to true, a few lines below) https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c0b389b33516fb3eaaad7c30bd11dba768882a7e/src/net_processing.cpp#L3182-L3186\r\n\r\nThis PR basically activates the `else`-branch code paths for all checks of `pfilter` again (on the master branch, they are dead code) by limiting the pointer's lifespan: instead of always having a filter set, the `pfilter` is only pointing to a `CBloomFilter`-instance after receiving a `filterload` message and the instance is destroyed again (and the pointer nullified) after receiving a `filterclear` message.\r\n\r\nHere is a before/after comparison in behaviour:\r\n| code part / scenario                          |    master branch                   |   PR branch                                          |\r\n| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| `getdata` processing for `MSG_FILTERED_BLOCK` | always responds with `merkleblock` | only responds if filter was set via `filterload`     |\r\n| `filteradd` processing, no filter was loaded  | nothing                            | peer's banscore increases by 100 (i.e. disconnect)   |\r\n\r\nOn the other code parts where `pfilter` is checked there is no change in the logic behaviour (except that `CBloomFilter::IsRelevantAndUpdate()` is unnecessarily called and immediately returned in the master branch).\r\nNote that the default constructor of `CBloomFilter` is only used for deserializing the received `filterload` message and nowhere else. The PR also contains a functional test checking that sending `getdata` for filtered blocks is ignored by the node if no bloom filter is set. \r\n",
