There are freely available documents explaining in detail the issues, but without explicit mentions, the developer trying to maintain the code needs an additional step of digging in commit history and PR conversations to figure it out.\r\nAdded comments to explicitly mention  CVE-2018-17144 and CVE-2012-2459, for more complete documentation. \r\nThis improves developer experience by making understanding the tests easier.\r\n\r\n",

It's been a while since I've had time to work on this PR, though. It has also already grown far beyond the original intention (just a couple comments). So probably better if I just fix the commit history, and open a new PR later on when I manage to add comments/tests for the remaining CVEs.\r\nThanks for reviewing!",

Plus updated both tests to a much recent version, expanding its testing coverage as well.\r\nNow the test suite is covering the primary CVE that btc had in the past.\r\n\r\nAs both tests were simply unusable before and we have a different synchronization process than upstream, plus we didn't have some params and init/global flags, this work isn't following a PR by PR back port path. Had to made my own way up to the complete tests support.\r\n\r\nMain pilar PRs from upstream from where this work was based:\r\n* #6329.\r\n* #11771.\r\n* #14119 (only `p2p_invalid_tx.py`, `p2p_invalid_block.py` and `mininode.py` changes).\r\n* #14247 (only 9b4a36effcf642f3844c6696b757266686ece11a).\r\n* #14696.",
