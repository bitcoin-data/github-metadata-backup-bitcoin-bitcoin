This should strengthen our guarantee that encoded float/double values are portable across platforms. It then removes the functionality to serialize doubles from serialize.h, and replaces its only (non-test) use for fee estimation data serialization with the software encoder.\r\n\r\nAt least on x86/ARM, the only difference should be how certain NaN values are encoded/decoded (but not *whether* they are NaN or not).\r\n\r\nIt comes with tests that verify on is_iec559 platforms (which are the only ones we support, at least for now) that the serialized bytes exactly match the binary representation of floats in memory (for non-NaN).",
