    "body": "Currently, if the tracepoints are compiled (e.g. in depends and release builds), we always prepare the tracepoint arguments regardless of the tracepoints being used or not. We made sure that the argument preparation is as cheap as possible, but we can almost completely eliminate any overhead for users not interested in the tracepoints (the vast majority), by gating the tracepoint argument preparation with an `if(something is attached to this tracepoint)`. To achieve this, we use the optional semaphore feature provided by SystemTap.\r\n\r\nThe first commit simplifies and deduplicates our tracepoint macros from 13 TRACEx macros to a single TRACEPOINT macro. This makes them easier to use and also avoids more duplicate macro definitions in the second commit.\r\n\r\nThe Linux tracing tools I'm aware of (bcc, bpftrace, libbpf, and systemtap) all support the semaphore gating feature. Thus, all existing tracepoints and their argument preparation is gated in the second commit. For details, please refer to the commit messages and the updated documentation in `doc/tracing.md`.\r\n\r\nAlso adding unit tests that include all tracepoint macros to make sure there are no compiler problems with them (e.g. some varadiac extension not supported). \r\n\r\nReviewers might want to check:\r\n- Do the tracepoints still work for you? Do the examples in `contrib/tracing/` run on your system (as bpftrace frequently breaks on every new version, please test master too if it should't work for you)? Do the CI interface tests still pass?\r\n- Is the new documentation clear? \r\n- The `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE(event, context)` macros places global variables in our global namespace. Is this something we strictly want to avoid or maybe move to all `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE`s to a separate .cpp file or even namespace? I like having the `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE()` in same file as the `TRACEPOINT()`, but open for suggestion on alternative approaches. \r\n- Are newly added tracepoints in the unit tests visible when using `readelf -n /src/test/test_bitcoin`? You can run the new unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin --run_test=util_trace_tests* --log_level=all`.\r\n<details><summary>Two of the added unit tests demonstrate that we are only processing the tracepoint arguments when attached by having a test-failure condition in the tracepoint argument preparation. The following bpftrace script can be used to demonstrate that the tests do indeed fail when attached to the tracepoints.</summary>\r\n\r\n`fail_tests.bt`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bpftrace\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/test/test_bitcoin:test:check_if_attached {\r\n  printf(\"the 'check_if_attached' test should have failed\\n\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/test/test_bitcoin:test:expensive_section {\r\n  printf(\"the 'expensive_section' test should have failed\\n\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin` and start `bpftrace fail_tests.bt -p $(pidof test_bitcoin)` in a separate terminal. The unit tests should fail with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning 594 test cases...\r\ntest/util_trace_tests.cpp(31): error: in \"util_trace_tests/test_tracepoint_check_if_attached\": check false has failed\r\ntest/util_trace_tests.cpp(51): error: in \"util_trace_tests/test_tracepoint_manual_tracepoint_active_check\": check false has failed\r\n\r\n*** 2 failures are detected in the test module \"Bitcoin Core Test Suite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThese links might provide more contextual information for reviewers:\r\n- [How SystemTap Userspace Probes Work by eklitzke](https://eklitzke.org/how-sytemtap-userspace-probes-work) (actually an example on Bitcoin Core; mentions that with semaphores \"the overhead for an untraced process is effectively zero.\")\r\n- [libbpf comment on USDT semaphore handling](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/blob/1596a09b5de2a50ab8d44218fc29b6d42f886305/src/usdt.c#L83-L92) (can recommend the whole comment for background on how the tracepoints and tracing tools work together)\r\n- https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/UserSpaceProbeImplementation#Semaphore_Handling",

Also using a separate TRACEPOINT0 macro for tracepoints without arguments, as using the TRACEPOINT macro without arguments is only be possible with GCC (clang warns that we are using gcc extensions). Tested with both clang and gcc.\r\n- Adressed https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26593#discussion_r1034548969 by dropping the `TRACEPOINT_UNCHECKED` macro.\r\n- Added unit tests for the TRACEPOINT macros. The tracepoints in the unit tests don't do anything in particular, but the tests show that the macros work. Through the CI we cover `ENABLE_TRACING` being defined and undefined. The test case `test_tracepoint_check_if_attached` also shows that the `TRACEPOINT_ACTIVE` macro is not broken (it's tested that it's working in the functional tests).",

          "body": "When producing a dummy signature for the purpose of estimating the transaction fee, do not assume an external signer performs R-value grinding on the signature.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this avoids a scenario where the fee rate is 1 sat / vbyte and a transaction with a 72 byte signature is not accepted into our mempool.\r\n\r\nSuggested testing:\r\n1. On master, launch with `-signet` and create an external signer wallet using e.g. a Trezor and HWI, see [guide](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md#example-usage) (with the GUI it should \"just work\" once you have the HWI path configured).\r\n2. Create a few addresses and fund them from the faucet: https://signet.bc-2.jp/ (wait for confirmation)\r\n3. Create another address, and now send the entire wallet to it, set the fee to 1 sat/byte\r\n4. Most likely this transaction never gets broadcast and you won't see it on the [signet explorer](https://explorer.bc-2.jp) \r\n\r\n5. With this PR, try again.\r\n6. Check the explorer and inspect the transaction. Each input witness starts with either `30440220` (R has 32 bytes) or `30440221` (R has 33 bytes). See this explainer for [DER encoding](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/92680/what-are-the-der-signature-and-sec-format).\r\n\r\nFixes #26030 ",

          "title": "wallet: group outputs only once, decouple it from Coin Selection",
          "body": "The idea originates from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24845#issuecomment-1130310321.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nFor clarity, it's recommended to start reviewing from the end result to understand the structure of the flow.\r\n\r\n#### GroupOutputs function rationale:\r\nIf \"Avoid Partial Spends\" is enabled, the function gathers outputs with the same script together inside a container. So Coin Selection can treats them as if them were just one possible input and either select them all or not select them. \r\n\r\n#### How the Inputs Fetch + Selection process roughly works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Fetch user’s manually selected inputs.\r\n2. Fetch wallet available coins (walks through the entire wallet txes map) and insert them into a set of vectors (each vector store outputs from a single type).\r\n3. Coin Selection Process:\r\n   Call `AttemptSelection` 8 times. Each of them expands the coin eligibility filter (accepting a larger subset of coins in the calculation) until it founds a solutions or completely fails if no solutions gets founds after the 8 rounds.\r\n\r\n   Each `AttemptSelection` call performs the following actions:\r\n     - For each output type supported by the wallet (P2SH, P2PK, P2WPKH, P2WSH and a combination of all of them):\r\n       Call ‘ChooseSelectionResult’ providing the respective, filtered by type, coins vector. Which:\r\n           I. Groups the outputs vector twice (one for positive only and a second one who includes the negative ones as well).\r\n              - GroupOutputs walks-through the entire inputted coins vector one time at least, + more if we are avoiding partial spends, to generate a vector of OutputGroups.\r\n           II. Then performs every coin selection algorithm using the recently created vector of OutputGroup: (1) BnB, (2) knapsack and (3) SRD.\r\n           III. Then returns the best solution out of them.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe perform the general operation of gathering outputs, with the same script, into a single container inside:\r\nEach coins selection attempt (8 times —> each coin eligibility filter), for each of the outputs vector who were filtered by type (plus another one joining all the outputs as well if needed), twice (one for the positive only outputs effective value and a second one for all of them).\r\n\r\nSo, in the worst case scenario where no solution is found after the 8 Coin Selection attempts, the `GroupOutputs` function is called 80 times (8 * 5 * 2).\r\n\r\n#### Improvements:\r\n\r\nThis proposal streamlines the process so that the output groups, filtered by coin eligibility and type, are created in a single loop outside of the Coin Selection Process. \r\n\r\nThe new process is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Fetch user’s manually selected inputs.\r\n2. Fetch wallet available coins.\r\n3. Group outputs by each coin eligibility filter and each different output type found.\r\n4. Coin Selection Process: \r\n   Call AttemptSelection 8 times. Each of them expands the coin eligibility filter (accepting different output groups) until it founds a solutions or completely fails if no solutions gets founds after the 8 rounds.\r\n   \r\n   Each ‘AttemptSelection’ call performs the following actions:\r\n      - For each output type supported by the wallet (P2SH, P2PK, P2WPKH, P2WSH and all of them):\r\n          A. Call ‘ChooseSelectionResult’ providing the respective, filtered by type, output group. Which:\r\n             I. Performs every coin selection algorithm using the provided vector of OutputGroup: (1) BnB, (2) knapsack and (3) SRD.\r\n             II. Then returns the best solution out of them.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExtra Note:\r\nThe next steps after this PR will be to:\r\n1) Merge `AvailableCoins` and `GroupOutputs` processes.\r\n2) Skip entire coin selection rounds if no new coins are added into the subsequent round.\r\n3) Remove global feerates from the OutputGroup class.\r\n4) Remove secondary \"grouped\" tx creation from `CreateTransactionInternal` by running Coin Selection results over the aps grouped outputs vs non-aps ones.",

          "title": "tracing: macOS USDT support",
          "body": "This PR adds macOS support for User-Space, Statically Defined Tracing (USDT) as well as dtrace example scripts based on the existing bpftrace scripts for Linux. This is tested on macOS 10.15. \r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of USDT only supports Linux  as the `DTRACE_PROBE*(context, event, ...args)` macros are not supported on macOS. As initially referenced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22238, the process of using USDT probes on macOS is slightly different and it's described in [the BUILDING CODE CONTAINING USDT PROBES section in the dtrace(1) manpage](https://gist.github.com/fanquake/e56c9866d53b326646d04ab43a8df9e2).\r\n\r\nThis more involved process includes\r\n\r\n1. Creating the providers description file `util/probes.d` which defines the providers and specifies their probes.\r\n2. Use `util/probes.d` to generate the header file `util/probes.h` with the neccesary tracepoints macros which are of the format `CONTEXT_EVENT(...args)`.\r\n3. Add the tracepoints macros to `util/trace.h`.\r\n\r\n##  Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n~Part of the macOS process is to create the providers description in a `.d` file. Therefore, types not supported by the D language (specifically `bool` and `std::byte`) cannot be used as part of the probe's signature. On those occasions, in lack of a better solution, only supported types are used and then a patch is applied at the generated `util/probes.h` file to replace the temporary D-supported types with those that we actually need.~\r\n\r\n~You can reproduce the initial header file by running `dtrace -h -s src/util/probes.d -o src/util/probes.h` (compiling with that results to errors because of not matching types) and then apply the [`probes-fix.diff`](https://gist.github.com/kouloumos/df773b1e0896adca827e7960eace1d21) patch with `git apply probes-fix.diff`.~\r\nEdit: `util/probes.h` is now generated during build time after changes (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541#discussion_r913646086 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541#discussion_r915192574) that removed the need for the non supported types.\r\n\r\nHaving the `bitcoind` binary compiled with USDT support, you can then use the dtrace example scripts `connectblock_benchmark.d`, `log_p2p_traffic.d`, `log_utxos.d` (root privileges needed) to test the macOS support. Extra documentation for those can be found at [contrib/tracing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/tracing) as they are functionally the same as the existing bpftrace scripts.\r\n\r\n### Adding tracepoints to Bitcoin Core (extra steps after this PR)\r\n\r\nAfter this PR when a new tracepoint is added, we will need to\r\n\r\n- Define the new probe for the tracepoint at `util/probes.d` together with a new provider if needed.\r\n- Add a new `#define context_event CONTEXT_EVENT`  macro at `util/trace.h`. This might not be final as discussed at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541#discussion_r913611013. \r\n",

This means that `CreateTransaction` is actually unaware of any user desired locktime or sequence numbers. This can have an effect on whether and how anti-fee-sniping works.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `CreateTransaction` aware of the locktime and preset input data by providing them to `CCoinControl`. `CreateTransasction` will then set the sequences, scriptSigs, scriptWItnesses, and locktime as appropriate if they are specified. This allows `FundTransaction` to actually use `CreateTransaction`'s result directly instead of having to extract the parts of it that it wants.\r\n\r\nAdditionally `FundTransaction` will return a `CreateTransactionResult` as `CreateTransaction` does instead of having several output parameters. Lastly, instead of using `-1` as a magic number for the change output position, the change position is changed to be an optional with no value set indicating no desired change output position (when provided as an input parameter) or no change output present (in the result).",

          "body": "The block index might contain stale blocks that are not part of the main chain. If a malicious peer is able to probe a node's block index for certain stale blocks then it can use this information to fingerprint the node.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving headers (either through a `cmpctblock` or `headers` messages) a node will send `getheaders` if the predecessor of the first header does not exist. This leaks information from the block index if the predecessor of the header is a stale block because no `getheaders` will be sent in that case revealing that the stale block exists in the index.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents this fingerprinting by sending additional `getheaders` messages in cases where not doing so leaks the existence of stale blocks. To determine when additional messages should be send, we introduce the `PeerManagerImpl::m_chain_tips_sets` map which keeps track of seen chain tips per network, effectively creating a per network view of the node's global block index.  We only try to accept new headers if they connect to anything in our global index and they connect to our active chain or to a chain that was previously sent to us by a peer on the same network. We send a `getheaders` message should these conditions not be met.",

Usage is demonstrated in the example script `contrib/tracing/mempool_monitor.py`. Interface tests are provided in `test/functional/interface_usdt_mempool.py`.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for passing the removal reason as a string instead of numerically is that the benefits of not having to maintain a redundant enum-string mapping seem to outweigh the small cost of string generation. The reject reason is passed as string as well, although in this instance the string does not have to be generated but is readily available.",

Please try sending\r\na smaller amount or manually consolidating your wallet's UTXOs\".\r\n\r\n2) If the user pre-selected inputs and disallowed the automatic coin\r\n   selection process (no other inputs are allowed), we now will\r\n   return: \r\n-> \"The preselected coins total amount does not cover the transaction\r\ntarget.

      "body": "Approach ACK\r\n\r\nSuper cool stuff. This effectively removes **any** runtime overhead of tracepoints on modern processors with branch prediction and speculative execution when no probes are attached .\r\n\r\nSome feedback on testing with [61ca0f9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/61ca0f99dbbe7c83495c4f346bc91eceaf07e7ea):\r\n\r\n- functional tests executed successfully on x86_64 and arm64\r\n- demo scripts in `contrib/tracing`: right now, `bpftrace` scripts work, `bcc` scripts don't\r\n- generated assembly looks as expected:\r\n    - tracing code is semaphore-gated using compare and branch instructions:\r\n \r\n        ```\r\n        # x86_64\r\n       cmp    WORD PTR [rip+0x8f816b],0x0        # 0x55d32c25d6c0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>\r\n       jne    0x55d32b965800 <_ZN8CConnman11PushMessageEP5CNodeO17CSerializedNetMsg+1488>\r\n\r\n       # arm64\r\n       ldrh    w1, [x0, #1776]\r\n       cbnz    w1, 0xaaaab2413fa4 <_ZN8CConnman11PushMessageEP5CNodeO17CSerializedNetMsg+1228>\r\n       ```\r\n    - tracing code uses `nop` when no probe is attached vs. `int3` (x86_64) / `brk` (arm64) to trap when probe is attached\r\n\r\n- used `gdb` to inspect semaphores: they are correctly initialized to zero and set to one if one or more(!) probes are attached. The documentation I read stated semaphores act as probe reference counters, so I was expecting semaphore values to reflect the number of probes. However, it looks like semaphores and counters were separated. This does not impact correct behavior though:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  (gdb) # no probe attached\r\n  (gdb) x/hx &net_outbound_message_semaphore\r\n  0xaaaacc8506f0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>:        0x0000\r\n  (gdb) # started one instance of contrib/tracing/log_p2p_traffic.bt\r\n  (gdb) x/hx &net_outbound_message_semaphore\r\n  0xaaaacc8506f0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>:        0x0001\r\n  (gdb) # started another instance of contrib/tracing/log_p2p_traffic.bt\r\n  (gdb) x/hx &net_outbound_message_semaphore\r\n  0xaaaacc8506f0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>:        0x0001\r\n  (gdb) # stopped first instance\r\n  (gdb) x/hx &net_outbound_message_semaphore\r\n  0xaaaacc8506f0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>:        0x0001\r\n  (gdb) # stopped second instance\r\n  (gdb) x/hx &net_outbound_message_semaphore\r\n  0xaaaacc8506f0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>:        0x0000\r\n  ```",

It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

          "title": "test/BIP324: functional tests for v2 P2P encryption",
          "body": "This PR introduces support for v2 P2P encryption(BIP 324) in the existing functional test framework and adds functional tests for the same.\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n3. this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    - `v2_state` is the object of class `EncryptedP2PState` in `P2PConnection` used to store its keys, session-id etc.\r\n    - a node [advertising](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#advertising-to-support-v2-p2p) support for  v2 P2P is different from a node actually [supporting v2 P2P](https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md#supporting-v2-p2p) (differ when false advertisement of services occur)\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `supports_v2_p2p` in `P2PConnection` to denote if it supports v2 P2P.\r\n        - introduce a boolean variable `advertises_v2_p2p` to denote whether `P2PConnection` which mimics peer behaviour advertises V2 P2P support. Default option is `False`.\r\n    - In the test framework, you can create Inbound and Outbound connections to `TestNode`\r\n        1. During **Inbound Connections**, `P2PConnection` is the initiator [`TestNode` <--------- `P2PConnection`]\r\n            - Case 1:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` advertises/signals v2 P2P support (means `self.nodes[i]` set up with `\"-v2transport=1\"`), different behaviour will be exhibited based on whether:\r\n                    1. `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P\r\n                    2. `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P\r\n               - In a real world scenario, the initiator node would intrinsically know if they support v2 P2P based on whatever code they choose to run. However, in the test scenario where we mimic peer behaviour, we have no way of knowing if `P2PConnection` should support v2 P2P or not. So `supports_v2_p2p` boolean variable is used as an option to enable support for v2 P2P in `P2PConnection`.\r\n              - Since the `TestNode` advertises v2 P2P support (using \"-v2transport=1\"), our initiator `P2PConnection` would send:\r\n                1. (if the `P2PConnection` supports v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                2. (if the `P2PConnection` does not support v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n           - Case 2:\r\n                - if the `TestNode` doesn't signal v2 P2P support; `P2PConnection` being the initiator would send version message to initiate a connection.\r\n       2. During **Outbound Connections** [TestNode --------> P2PConnection]\r\n           - initiator `TestNode` would send:\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) ellswift + garbage bytes to initiate the connection\r\n                - (if the `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P) version message to initiate the connection\r\n          - Suppose `P2PConnection` advertises v2 P2P support when it actually doesn't support v2 P2P (false advertisement scenario)\r\n               - `TestNode` sends ellswift + garbage bytes\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives but can't process it and disconnects.\r\n               - `TestNode` then tries using v1 P2P and sends version message\r\n               - `P2PConnection` receives/processes this successfully and they communicate on v1 P2P\r\n\r\n4. the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n5. includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.\r\nAlso written a more elaborate explanation here - https://github.com/stratospher/blogosphere/blob/main/integration_test_bip324.md",

      "body": "Lightly tested ACK.\r\n\r\n1. I didn't manage to get `bpftrace` itself running on my Ubuntu system [yet](https://hackmd.io/@willcl-ark/SyZgMRbg3), but I was able to get the python scripts `log_raw_p2p_msgs.py`, `log_utxocache_flush.py` and `p2p_monitor.py` (using `bcc`) to run successfully under `sudo`.  \r\n  (I do wonder about the viability of the `bpftrace` scripts in this project, seeing as they seem to be so brittle/difficult to use.)\r\n2. The usdt tests all passed successfully:\r\n  ```log\r\n  interface_usdt_coinselection.py                        | ✓ Passed  | 5 s\r\n  interface_usdt_net.py                                  | ✓ Passed  | 4 s\r\n  interface_usdt_utxocache.py                            | ✓ Passed  | 11 s\r\n  interface_usdt_validation.py                           | ✓ Passed  | 3 s\r\n  ```\r\n3. The new variadic macro is much simpler to reason about and I agree seems like a nice win all round. \r\n4. I was also able to see the semaphores being loaded from memory, compared to zero, and conditionally jumped to, as detailed in the PR description, e.g. for `CCoinsViewCache::AddCoin()`\r\n  ```gdb\r\n     ...\r\n     0x0000000000b60927 <+615>:   movzwl 0xa64bea(%rip),%eax        # 0x15c5518 <utxocache_add_semaphore>\r\n     0x0000000000b6092e <+622>:   cmp    $0x0,%eax\r\n     0x0000000000b60931 <+625>:   jle    0xb609d6 <_ZN15CCoinsViewCache7AddCoinERK9COutPointO4Coinb+790>\r\n     ...\r\n  ```\r\n5. I don't think having these semaphores in the global namespace should be a big issue for debugging or namespacing. So really it comes down to organisational priorities, where I'd agree with you that having them in the same file as the tracepoint feels cleaner.",

You can find it in my [26593-additions](https://github.com/kouloumos/bitcoin/tree/26593-additions) branch alongside usage details in order to reproduce the results.\r\n```\r\n# extend_gdb.py\r\nTo make this file available to your gdb process:\r\n1. Make sure that this file and `tracepoint_helper.py` are in the same dir\r\n2. (gdb) source extend_gdb.py\r\n\r\nYou can now run the custom commands of this file.\r\nThe main command is:\r\n(gdb) scenario run <scenario> <tracepoint> (--no-build)\r\n\r\nRunning it with no arguments will run all scenarios:\r\n- tracepoints disabled\r\n- tracepoints enabled\r\n- tracepoints enabled (hooked)\r\n\r\nThe records are then saved in \"output_<commit-hash>.txt\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes for the preliminary work on that branch:\r\n- it's a rebased vesion of this PR in order to include the newly added mempool tracepoints.\r\n- includes \"missing\" bpftrace scripts because these are what I'm using in my script to enable probes/hook on tracepoints.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n Regarding the `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE(event, context)` macros: I don't see any advantage on having them in the same file. I consider them as part of tracepoints' inner workings which are already abstracted in another file. But still not opposing the current implementation as (based on my attempts) having them in `trace.h` is not possible and the inclusion of an extra file probably adds unnecessary complexity at this point. However, with my alternative approach (explained below) those are not needed.\r\n\r\n#### macos support compatibility\r\n\r\nI've rebased https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541 on top of this PR in [macos-usdt-support-26593](https://github.com/kouloumos/bitcoin/commits/macos-usdt-support-26593) and it works; there is only an issue with the new unit test. Because the macos implementation doesn't support arbitrary tracepoints, the `TRACEPOINT` macro expands to \"undeclared identifier\" error. To solve it, I made a change to conditionally include that test file to the build process. As this test case is only conditionally applicable (empty if not linux), maybe this can also apply to this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Another approach(?)\r\n\r\nThis PR's gated approach reminded me of the [auto-generated header file](https://gist.github.com/kouloumos/df773b1e0896adca827e7960eace1d21) from `probes.d` in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541. In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541#issuecomment-1174858051 you mentioned how that file could also be generated on Linux with dtrace supplied by Systemtap, so I replicated this sempahor-gated functionality using the semaphores of the [linux auto-generated `probes.h` file](https://gist.github.com/0xB10C/655e506e9e53092f4becf412284f572a). The main advantage of this alternative approach is the unified build process for linux and macos as the current (pending) implementation for macos already uses the `probes.d` file. It then becomes trivial to also support tracepoints on macos. What do you think of this approach? This is essentially a mashup of your work, the macos support branch and [eklitzke's probes_sdt branch](https://github.com/eklitzke/bitcoin/tree/probes_sdt). You can find my changes at the [26593-another-approach](https://github.com/kouloumos/bitcoin/tree/26593-another-approach) branch ([diff](https://github.com/kouloumos/bitcoin/compare/26593-additions...26593-another-approach)) , feel free to pick whatever you like.",

          "body": "Currently the mempool returns and consumes sets of multiindex iterators in its public API. A likely motivation for this over working with references to the actual values is that the multi index interface works with these iterators and not with pointers or references to the actual values.\r\n\r\nHowever, using the iterator type in the `setEntries` set provides little benefit in practice as applied currently. Its purpose, ownership, and safety semantics often remain ambiguous, and it is hardly used for actually iterating through the data structures. So replace it where possible with `CTxMemPoolEntryRef`s.\r\n\r\nSince `CTxMemPoolEntry` itself refers to its Parents and Children by `CTxMemPoolEntryRef` and not `txiter`, this allowed for an overall reduction of calls to `iterator_to`. See the [docs](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_83_0/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/indices.html#iterator_to) on `iterator_to` for more guidance.\r\n\r\nNo change in the performance of the mempool code was observed in my benchmarks.\r\n\r\nThis also makes the goal of eliminating boost types from the headers as done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28335 more feasible.\r\n",

          "title": "RFC: Remove boost usage from kernel api / headers",
          "body": "Similarly to #28327 I wanted to open this PR to receive some opinions and better approaches.\r\n\r\nThe kernel library is currently at the stage where unwanted headers are removed from its set of headers. In practice, this means we are reducing the number of includes that are required for compiling the experimental `bitcoin-chainstate` binary. This is described in stage 1 step 3 of the [project tracking issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).\r\n\r\nCurrently the mempool is part of the kernel library. The mempool headers include the boost multi index headers. Thus any application wanting to use the kernel library and its headers will have to include the boost headers too. This is not only undesirable because of the sheer size of these headers, but also might lead to conflicts if the including application uses a different boost version.\r\n\r\nIn the approach laid out by this PR, mempool member variables and methods are declared in the header without having to include boost by either wrapping them in a struct and [pimpling](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) them, or making methods static implementation functions. The boost definitions are gathered into separate header (`mempool_set_definitions.h`) that is only included by implementation files that require definitions of the boost types. This allows us to retain the current architecture with roughly the same interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe approach laid out by this PR also has some, albeit small, compilation speed and size benefits. Averaged over a few of compilation runs I consistently observe faster compilation by a couple of seconds and some smaller pre-processed and compiled object sizes. The main detractor of this method is obviously the number of lines touched. However it also has the benefit of inventorizing all the files that require direct access to the mempool data structures as well getting rid of boost multi index includes in non-kernel implementation files that include the mempool, but don't directly manipulate its data structures (e.g. wallet.cpp).\r\n\r\nA much simpler alternative approach, at least on the surface, would be removing all `txmempool.h` includes from kernel library headers (see [this branch](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/mempoolBoostSimple)). Currently this is only `validation.h`.  Due to the mutex member of `CTxMemPool` and the correspondingly defined lock decorators on the chainstate methods this becomes a bit more complicated though and I am not sure how this might be possible with the current architecture.\r\n\r\nA discussion of how and if to remove the mempool from the kernel library has so far been intentionally punted to the next stage of the kernel library development. Pimpling the mempool itself precludes this discussion, since the library could never be shipped with the `CTxMemPool` headers. Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.",

Thanks for the macro-magic. There's now only the `TRACEPOINT()` macro that works for tracepoints with 0 to 12 args.\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26593#discussion_r1140555021: I clarified unit tests and added a new test for a manual `TRACEPOINT_ACTIVE()` macro.\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26593#discussion_r1161156029: updated the GDB `info probes` output in the docs\r\n\r\n\r\nI also thought a bit about @kouloumos alternative approach that would allow us to use the tracepoints on Linux, macOS and potentially *BSD (not tested). This would require `dtrace` during build-time. I'm not sure this is something we want. If we explore in this direction, then it's probably better to do it in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nAs the first commit is an overall simplification and cleanup, it _might_ make also sense to split it off into a separate PR while we are exploring alternatives.\r\n\r\nWhile this is rebased and _ready for review_ again, I'd prefer progress on #25832 while we're exploring alternatives to #26593. I'll leave this as work-in-progress until we're clearer on alternatives.",

          "body": "**Note: this PR has been superseded by #28948 (v3) and #28984 (package RBF)**\r\n\r\nSee #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A set of policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. Namely, it allows users to opt in to more restrictive descendant limits for shared transactions. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying.\r\n\r\nFAQ: is v3 still helpful even with cluster mempool (#27677) ?\r\n\r\n- Rule 3 pinning: This is addressed with v3 but not really with cluster mempool (descendant allowance is still too permissive).\r\n- Package RBF and ACP pinning: This PR allows for package RBF with v3 packages. V3 has an effective \"cluster limit\" of 2 which makes it very cheap to calculate the mining score of a v3 transaction. With cluster mempool, which also makes it easier to calculate mining score, we could have package RBF for non-v3 transactions.\r\n- Allowing 0fee transactions: This PR allows v3 transactions to be below minimum relay feerate, provided they are CPFP'd. This is because the simplified topology allows us to avoid situations like the ones described in #26933. With cluster mempool, we can allow this for non-v3 transactions.",

          "body": "Since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17487 we no longer need to clear the coins cache when syncing to disk. A warm coins cache significantly speeds up block connection, and only needs to be fully flushed when nearing the `dbcache` limit.\r\n\r\nFor frequent pruning flushes there's no need to empty the cache and kill connect block speed. However, simply using `Sync` in place of `Flush` actually slows down a pruned full IBD with a high `dbcache` value. This is because as the cache grows, sync takes longer since every coin in the cache is scanned to check if it's dirty. For frequent prune flushes and a large cache this constant scanning starts to really slow IBD down, and just emptying the cache on every prune becomes faster.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we can add two pointers to each cache entry and construct a doubly linked list of dirty entries. We can then only iterate through all dirty entries on each `Sync`, and simply clear the pointers after.\r\n\r\nWith this approach a full IBD with `dbcache=16384` and `prune=550` was 32% faster than master. For default `dbcache=450` speedup was ~9%. All benchmarks were run with `stopatheight=800000`.\r\n\r\n|  | prune | dbcache | time | max RSS | speedup |\r\n|-----------:|----------:|------------:|--------:|-------------:|--------------:|\r\n| master | 550 | 16384 | 8:52:57 | 2,417,464k | - |\r\n| branch | 550 | 16384 | 6:01:00 | 16,216,736k | 32% |\r\n| branch | 550 | 450 | 8:05:08 | 2,818,072k | 8.8% |\r\n| master | 10000 | 5000 | 8:19:59 | 2,962,752k | - |\r\n| branch | 10000 | 5000| 5:56:39 | 6,179,764k | 28.8% |\r\n| master | 0 | 16384 | 4:51:53 | 14,726,408k | - |\r\n| branch | 0 | 16384 | 4:43:11 | 16,526,348k | 2.7% |\r\n| master | 0 | 450 | 7:08:07 | 3,005,892k | - |\r\n| branch | 0 | 450 | 6:57:24 | 3,013,556k |2.6%|\r\n\r\nWhile the 2 pointers add memory to each cache entry, it did not slow down IBD. For non-pruned IBD results were similar for this branch and master. A non-pruned IBD with full `dbcache` to tip ended up using 12% more memory, but it was also 2.7% faster somehow. For smaller `dbcache` values the `dbcache` limit is respected so does not consume more memory, and the potentially more frequent flushes were not significant enough to cause any slowdown.\r\n\r\nInspired by [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15265#issuecomment-457720636).\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11315.",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts.

I'll leave this as work-in-progress until we're clearer on alternatives.\r\n\r\nI've also been working on a branch that adds tracepoint support for macOS and FreeBSD based on this branch.

See the original branch for the evolution of the spec.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review? \r\n\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review. Probably starting with ECDH and the Noise Protocol.\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nSilent Payments also needs the ECDH module, so I cherry-picked the commit from #28122. It uses ECDH is a slightly different way, but perhaps there's more overlap to be had.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Upstream issues\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Noise\r\n\r\n- [ ] use EllSwift https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66, implemented in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/28\r\n- [ ] certificate signing issue: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/717, fix in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/29\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [x] persist static key (needs #29229)\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [x] create `Sv2Transport` subclass similar to `V2Transport`: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/27\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n- [ ] adjust base58 encoding of authority public key https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/721\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [x] hold on to templates a bit after a block is found https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/709 (in case of race to prevent downstream crashes, though we still wouldn't relay it without additional changes)\r\n- [ ] hold on to template transactions even if the mempool drops them (for some time)\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

When optional `change_pos` is unset, we should return -1 and not 0.\r\n\r\nI added two new checks to the `test/functional/interface_usdt_coinselection.py` which adds coverage for the situations when `normal_create_tx_internal` and `aps_create_tx_internal` events occur with no change.  \r\n\r\nYou can reproduce this bug using the coin-selection-simulation scripts as described in [issue #16](https://github.com/achow101/coin-selection-simulation/issues/16). You can also run the `interface_usdt_coinselection.py` test  without the changes to `wallet/spend.cpp`.",

          "title": "Stratum v2 Template Provider (take 3)",
          "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\n### Related useful PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #26812\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThere's roughly three layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer\r\n3. The Template Provider\r\n\r\n* the `ci:` commits (#29274) are there to facilitate PR's against this branch, but they are not blocking for Stratum v2\r\n* the commits that move `transport.h` and some other stuff from `node` to `common` are not blocking. But in the longer run I'd like to see process separation between the node and the template provider.\r\n* I will occasionally add commits to _undo_ bug fixes, in order to stay compatible with the SRI `main` branch. Those will get dropped over time and can be ignored. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

          "title": "kernel: Handle fatal errors through return values",
          "body": "Based on #25665.\r\n\r\nCurrently functions issuing fatal errors call the `fatalError` notification method to issue a shutdown procedure. This makes it hard for higher level functions to figure out if an error deeper in the call stack occurred. For users of the kernel it might also be difficult to assert which function call issued a fatal error if they are being run concurrently. If the kernel would eventually be used by external users, getting fatal error information through a callback instead of function return values would also be cumbersome and limiting. Unit, bench, and fuzz tests currently don't have a way to effectively test against fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThis patch set is an attempt to make fatal error handling in the kernel code more transparent. Fatal errors are now passed up the call stack through `util::Result<T, FatalError>` failure values. A previous attempt at this by theuni always immediately returned failure values if a function call returned a failure. However, this is not always desirable (see discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1256378064)). Sometimes, further operations can still be completed even if a fatal error was issued. The solution to this is that these \"ignored\" errors are still moved through `util::Result`'s error string values with its `.MoveMessages` method, even while a failure value in the result is not present.\r\n\r\nNext to some smaller behavior changes, the most significant change is that the issuing of a shutdown procedure is delayed until a potential fatal error is handled as opposed to immediately when it is first encountered. Another effect is that potential fatal errors are now asserted in the bench, fuzz and unit tests. Some of the currently not immediately returned fatal errors need some further scrutiny. These are marked with a `TODO (fatal error)` comment and could be tackled in a later PR.\r\n\r\nTo validate this approach a new clang-tidy check is introduced. It implements the following checks:\r\n\r\n1. If a function calls another function with a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` return type, its return type has to be `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` too, or it has to handle the value returned by the function with one of `CheckFatal`, `HandleFatalError`,\r\n`UnwrapFatalError`, or `CheckFatalFailure`.\r\n2. In functions returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` a call to a function returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` needs to propagate the value by either:\r\n   - Returning it immediately\r\n   - Assigning it immediately to an existing result with `.MoveMessages()` or `.Set()`\r\n   - Eventually passing it as an argument to a `.MoveMessages()`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587) and is a step towards stage 2, creating a more refined kernel API.",

This makes error handling in libbitcoinkernel application code difficult, because the only way to handle these errors is to register for [notification callbacks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/kernel/notifications_interface.h).

          "body": "This adds five new tracepoints with documentation and tests for network connections:\r\n\r\n- established connections with `net:inbound_connection` and `net:outbound_connection`\r\n- closed connections (both closed by us or by the peer) with `net:closed_connnection`\r\n- inbound connections that we choose to evict with `net:evicted_inbound_connection`\r\n- connections that are misbehaving and punished with `net:misbehaving_connection`\r\n\r\nI've been using these tracepoints for a few months now to monitor connection lifetimes, re-connection frequency by IP and netgroup, misbehavior, peer discouragement, and eviction and more. Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, score_before=0, score_increase=20, message='getdata message size = 50001', threshold_exceeded=false\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",

While we already made\nsure not to include expensive arguments in our tracepoints, this\ncommit introduces gating to make sure the arguments are only prepared\nif the tracepoints are actually used. This is a win-win improvement\nto our tracing framework. For users not interested in tracing, the\noverhead is reduced to a cheap 'greater than 0' compare. As the\nsemaphore-gating technique used here is available in bpftrace, bcc,\nand libbpf, users interested in tracing don't have to change their\ntracing scripts while profiting from potential future tracepoints\npassing slightly more expensive arguments. An example are mempool\ntracepoints that pass serialized transactions. We've avoided the\nserialization in the past as it was too expensive.\n\nUnder the hood, the semaphore-gating works by placing a 2-byte\nsemaphore in the '.probes' ELF section. The address of the semaphore\nis contained in the ELF note providing the tracepoint information\n(`readelf -n ./src/bitcoind | grep NT_STAPSDT`). Tracing toolkits\nlike bpftrace, bcc, and libbpf increase the semaphore at the address\nupon attaching to the tracepoint. We only prepare the arguments and\nreach the tracepoint if the semaphore is greater than zero. The\nsemaphore is decreased when detaching from the tracepoint.\n\nThis also extends the \"Adding a new tracepoint\" documentation to\ninclude information about the semaphores and updated step-by-step\ninstructions on how to add a new tracepoint.\n",
