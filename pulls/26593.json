    "body": "Currently, if the tracepoints are compiled (e.g. in depends and release builds), we always prepare the tracepoint arguments regardless of the tracepoints being used or not. We made sure that the argument preparation is as cheap as possible, but we can almost completely eliminate any overhead for users not interested in the tracepoints (the vast majority), by gating the tracepoint argument preparation with an `if(something is attached to this tracepoint)`. To achieve this, we use the optional semaphore feature provided by SystemTap.\r\n\r\nThe first commit simplifies and deduplicates our tracepoint macros from 12 TRACEn macros to a single TRACEPOINT macro. The `TRACE(context, event)` macro (without arguments) is renamed to `TRACEPOINT0(context, event)`. This makes them easier to use and also avoids more duplicate macro definitions in the second commit. These changes should be compatible with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541 and both https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26531 should be trivial to rebase and adopt to this.\r\n\r\nThe Linux tracing tools I'm aware of (bcc, bpftrace, libbpf, and systemtap) all support the semaphore gating feature. Thus, all existing tracepoints and their argument preparation is gated in the second commit. For details, please refer to the commit messages and the updated documentation in `doc/tracing.md`.\r\n\r\nAlso adding unit tests that include all tracepoint macros to make sure there are no compiler problems with them (e.g. some varadiac extension not supported). \r\n\r\nReviewers might want to check:\r\n- Do the tracepoints still work for you? Do the examples in `contrib/tracing/` run on your system (as bpftrace frequently breaks on every new version, please test master too if it should't work for you)? Do the CI interface tests still pass?\r\n- Is the new documentation clear? \r\n- As a demonstration that the tracepoint gating works, https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/commit/21774ab9618932a4df68baa36de11c7788adf143 extends the PR branch. Here is the [Cirrus CI output](https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5278617885212672) for the task running the USDT interface tests on this commit. Do you agree that this demonstrates that the semaphore gating works?\r\n- The `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE(event, context)` macros places global variables in our global namespace. Is this something we strictly want to avoid or maybe move to all `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE`s to a separate .cpp file or even namespace? I like having the `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE()` in same file as the `TRACEPOINT()`, but open for suggestion on alternative approaches. \r\n- Are newly added tracepoints in the unit tests visible when using `readelf -n /src/test/test_bitcoin`? You can run the new unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin --run_test=util_trace_tests* --log_level=all`.\r\n\r\nThese links might provide more contextual information for reviewers:\r\n- [How SystemTap Userspace Probes Work by eklitzke](https://eklitzke.org/how-sytemtap-userspace-probes-work) (actually an example on Bitcoin Core; mentions that with semaphores \"the overhead for an untraced process is effectively zero.\")\r\n- [libbpf comment on USDT semaphore handling](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/blob/1596a09b5de2a50ab8d44218fc29b6d42f886305/src/usdt.c#L83-L92) (can recommend the whole comment for background on how the tracepoints and tracing tools work together)\r\n- https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/UserSpaceProbeImplementation#Semaphore_Handling",

      "body": "- Addressed https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26593#discussion_r1034160141 by using `__VA_ARGS__`. Also using a separate TRACEPOINT0 macro for tracepoints without arguments, as using the TRACEPOINT macro without arguments is only be possible with GCC (clang warns that we are using gcc extensions). Tested with both clang and gcc.\r\n- Adressed https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26593#discussion_r1034548969 by dropping the `TRACEPOINT_UNCHECKED` macro.\r\n- Added unit tests for the TRACEPOINT macros. The tracepoints in the unit tests don't do anything in particular, but the tests show that the macros work. Through the CI we cover `ENABLE_TRACING` being defined and undefined. The test case `test_tracepoint_check_if_attached` also shows that the `TRACEPOINT_ACTIVE` macro is not broken (it's tested that it's working in the functional tests).",

      "body": "Approach ACK\r\n\r\nSuper cool stuff. This effectively removes **any** runtime overhead of tracepoints on modern processors with branch prediction and speculative execution when no probes are attached .\r\n\r\nSome feedback on testing with [61ca0f9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/61ca0f99dbbe7c83495c4f346bc91eceaf07e7ea):\r\n\r\n- functional tests executed successfully on x86_64 and arm64\r\n- demo scripts in `contrib/tracing`: right now, `bpftrace` scripts work, `bcc` scripts don't\r\n- generated assembly looks as expected:\r\n    - tracing code is semaphore-gated using compare and branch instructions:\r\n \r\n        ```\r\n        # x86_64\r\n       cmp    WORD PTR [rip+0x8f816b],0x0        # 0x55d32c25d6c0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>\r\n       jne    0x55d32b965800 <_ZN8CConnman11PushMessageEP5CNodeO17CSerializedNetMsg+1488>\r\n\r\n       # arm64\r\n       ldrh    w1, [x0, #1776]\r\n       cbnz    w1, 0xaaaab2413fa4 <_ZN8CConnman11PushMessageEP5CNodeO17CSerializedNetMsg+1228>\r\n       ```\r\n    - tracing code uses `nop` when no probe is attached vs. `int3` (x86_64) / `brk` (arm64) to trap when probe is attached\r\n\r\n- used `gdb` to inspect semaphores: they are correctly initialized to zero and set to one if one or more(!) probes are attached. The documentation I read stated semaphores act as probe reference counters, so I was expecting semaphore values to reflect the number of probes. However, it looks like semaphores and counters were separated. This does not impact correct behavior though:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  (gdb) # no probe attached\r\n  (gdb) x/hx &net_outbound_message_semaphore\r\n  0xaaaacc8506f0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>:        0x0000\r\n  (gdb) # started one instance of contrib/tracing/log_p2p_traffic.bt\r\n  (gdb) x/hx &net_outbound_message_semaphore\r\n  0xaaaacc8506f0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>:        0x0001\r\n  (gdb) # started another instance of contrib/tracing/log_p2p_traffic.bt\r\n  (gdb) x/hx &net_outbound_message_semaphore\r\n  0xaaaacc8506f0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>:        0x0001\r\n  (gdb) # stopped first instance\r\n  (gdb) x/hx &net_outbound_message_semaphore\r\n  0xaaaacc8506f0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>:        0x0001\r\n  (gdb) # stopped second instance\r\n  (gdb) x/hx &net_outbound_message_semaphore\r\n  0xaaaacc8506f0 <net_outbound_message_semaphore>:        0x0000\r\n  ```",

This is a win-win improvement\nto our tracing framework. For users not interested in tracing, the\noverhead is reduced to a cheap 'greater than 0' compare. As the\nsemaphore-gating technique used here is available in bpftrace, bcc,\nand libbpf, users interested in tracing don't have to change their\ntracing scripts while profiting from potential future tracepoints\npassing slightly more expensive arguments. In the context of #26531's\nmempool tracepoints, one example could be passing serialized\ntransactions for RBF replacements.\n\nUnder the hood, the semaphore-gating works by placing a 2-byte\nsemaphore in the '.probes' ELF section. The address of the semaphore\nis contained in the ELF note providing the tracepoint information\n(`readelf -n ./src/bitcoind | grep NT_STAPSDT`). Tracing toolkits\nlike bpftrace, bcc, and libbpf increase the semaphore at the address\nupon attaching to the tracepoint. We only prepare the arguments and\nreach the tracepoint if the semaphore is greater than zero. The\nsemaphore is decreased when detaching from the tracepoint.\n\nThe implementation of the TRACEPOINT_ACTIVE macro is flexible enough\nthat it can be adapted for macOS dtrace tracing (#25541). With dtrace,\n[CONTEXT]_[EVENT]_ENABLED() can be used to gate the tracepoints.\n\nWhile the TRACEPOINT0(context, event) macro without arguments\ndoesn't need a check if it's active or not (no arguments can be\nprepared and passed), it does require a TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE() due\nto _SDT_HAS_SEMAPHORES requiring all tracepoints to have a semaphore.\nAs the check is cheap, a check is added to not cause problems with\nthe semaphore being unused.\n\nThis also extends the \"Adding a new tracepoint\" documentation to\ninclude information about the semaphores and updated step-by-step\ninstructions on how to add a new tracepoint.\n",

      "body": "Lightly tested ACK.\r\n\r\n1. I didn't manage to get `bpftrace` itself running on my Ubuntu system [yet](https://hackmd.io/@willcl-ark/SyZgMRbg3), but I was able to get the python scripts `log_raw_p2p_msgs.py`, `log_utxocache_flush.py` and `p2p_monitor.py` (using `bcc`) to run successfully under `sudo`.  \r\n  (I do wonder about the viability of the `bpftrace` scripts in this project, seeing as they seem to be so brittle/difficult to use.)\r\n2. The usdt tests all passed successfully:\r\n  ```log\r\n  interface_usdt_coinselection.py                        | ✓ Passed  | 5 s\r\n  interface_usdt_net.py                                  | ✓ Passed  | 4 s\r\n  interface_usdt_utxocache.py                            | ✓ Passed  | 11 s\r\n  interface_usdt_validation.py                           | ✓ Passed  | 3 s\r\n  ```\r\n3. The new variadic macro is much simpler to reason about and I agree seems like a nice win all round. \r\n4. I was also able to see the semaphores being loaded from memory, compared to zero, and conditionally jumped to, as detailed in the PR description, e.g. for `CCoinsViewCache::AddCoin()`\r\n  ```gdb\r\n     ...\r\n     0x0000000000b60927 <+615>:   movzwl 0xa64bea(%rip),%eax        # 0x15c5518 <utxocache_add_semaphore>\r\n     0x0000000000b6092e <+622>:   cmp    $0x0,%eax\r\n     0x0000000000b60931 <+625>:   jle    0xb609d6 <_ZN15CCoinsViewCache7AddCoinERK9COutPointO4Coinb+790>\r\n     ...\r\n  ```\r\n5. I don't think having these semaphores in the global namespace should be a big issue for debugging or namespacing. So really it comes down to organisational priorities, where I'd agree with you that having them in the same file as the tracepoint feels cleaner.",

You can find it in my [26593-additions](https://github.com/kouloumos/bitcoin/tree/26593-additions) branch alongside usage details in order to reproduce the results.\r\n```\r\n# extend_gdb.py\r\nTo make this file available to your gdb process:\r\n1. Make sure that this file and `tracepoint_helper.py` are in the same dir\r\n2. (gdb) source extend_gdb.py\r\n\r\nYou can now run the custom commands of this file.\r\nThe main command is:\r\n(gdb) scenario run <scenario> <tracepoint> (--no-build)\r\n\r\nRunning it with no arguments will run all scenarios:\r\n- tracepoints disabled\r\n- tracepoints enabled\r\n- tracepoints enabled (hooked)\r\n\r\nThe records are then saved in \"output_<commit-hash>.txt\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes for the preliminary work on that branch:\r\n- it's a rebased vesion of this PR in order to include the newly added mempool tracepoints.\r\n- includes \"missing\" bpftrace scripts because these are what I'm using in my script to enable probes/hook on tracepoints.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n Regarding the `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE(event, context)` macros: I don't see any advantage on having them in the same file. I consider them as part of tracepoints' inner workings which are already abstracted in another file. But still not opposing the current implementation as (based on my attempts) having them in `trace.h` is not possible and the inclusion of an extra file probably adds unnecessary complexity at this point. However, with my alternative approach (explained below) those are not needed.\r\n\r\n#### macos support compatibility\r\n\r\nI've rebased https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541 on top of this PR in [macos-usdt-support-26593](https://github.com/kouloumos/bitcoin/commits/macos-usdt-support-26593) and it works; there is only an issue with the new unit test. Because the macos implementation doesn't support arbitrary tracepoints, the `TRACEPOINT` macro expands to \"undeclared identifier\" error. To solve it, I made a change to conditionally include that test file to the build process. As this test case is only conditionally applicable (empty if not linux), maybe this can also apply to this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Another approach(?)\r\n\r\nThis PR's gated approach reminded me of the [auto-generated header file](https://gist.github.com/kouloumos/df773b1e0896adca827e7960eace1d21) from `probes.d` in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541. In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25541#issuecomment-1174858051 you mentioned how that file could also be generated on Linux with dtrace supplied by Systemtap, so I replicated this sempahor-gated functionality using the semaphores of the [linux auto-generated `probes.h` file](https://gist.github.com/0xB10C/655e506e9e53092f4becf412284f572a). The main advantage of this alternative approach is the unified build process for linux and macos as the current (pending) implementation for macos already uses the `probes.d` file. It then becomes trivial to also support tracepoints on macos. What do you think of this approach? This is essentially a mashup of your work, the macos support branch and [eklitzke's probes_sdt branch](https://github.com/eklitzke/bitcoin/tree/probes_sdt). You can find my changes at the [26593-another-approach](https://github.com/kouloumos/bitcoin/tree/26593-another-approach) branch ([diff](https://github.com/kouloumos/bitcoin/compare/26593-additions...26593-another-approach)) , feel free to pick whatever you like.",
