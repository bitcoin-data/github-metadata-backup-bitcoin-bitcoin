    "body": "Similarly to #28327 I wanted to open this PR to receive some opinions and better approaches.\r\n\r\nThe kernel library is currently at the stage where unwanted headers are removed from its set of headers. In practice, this means we are reducing the number of includes that are required for compiling the experimental `bitcoin-chainstate` binary. This is described in stage 1 step 3 of the [project tracking issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).\r\n\r\nCurrently the mempool is part of the kernel library. The mempool headers include the boost multi index headers. Thus any application wanting to use the kernel library and its headers will have to include the boost headers too. This is not only undesirable because of the sheer size of these headers, but also might lead to conflicts if the including application uses a different boost version.\r\n\r\nIn the approach laid out by this PR, mempool member variables and methods are declared in the header without having to include boost by either wrapping them in a struct and [pimpling](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) them, or making methods static implementation functions. The boost definitions are gathered into separate header (`mempool_set_definitions.h`) that is only included by implementation files that require definitions of the boost types. This allows us to retain the current architecture with roughly the same interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe approach laid out by this PR also has some, albeit small, compilation speed and size benefits. Averaged over a few of compilation runs I consistently observe faster compilation by a couple of seconds and some smaller pre-processed and compiled object sizes. The main detractor of this method is obviously the number of lines touched. However it also has the benefit of inventorizing all the files that require direct access to the mempool data structures as well getting rid of boost multi index includes in non-kernel implementation files that include the mempool, but don't directly manipulate its data structures (e.g. wallet.cpp).\r\n\r\nA much simpler alternative approach, at least on the surface, would be removing all `txmempool.h` includes from kernel library headers (see [this branch](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/mempoolBoostSimple)). Currently this is only `validation.h`.  Due to the mutex member of `CTxMemPool` and the correspondingly defined lock decorators on the chainstate methods this becomes a bit more complicated though and I am not sure how this might be possible with the current architecture.\r\n\r\nA discussion of how and if to remove the mempool from the kernel library has so far been intentionally punted to the next stage of the kernel library development. Pimpling the mempool itself precludes this discussion, since the library could never be shipped with the `CTxMemPool` headers. Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #28391 which simplifies some of the required refactors.",

          "body": "This contains everything to make mempool/validation logic ready for package relay (see #27463).\r\n\r\nDesign goals:\r\n- Be able to gracefully deal with any arbitrary list of transactions (these come from p2p)\r\n- Validate any ancestor package so that the incentive-compatible transactions end up in our mempool.\r\n  - If the transactions would be accepted individually, they should also be accepted through `AcceptPackage`. We don't want to accidentally reject things just because we happened to download them as a package.\r\n  - Bug prior to these changes: we required `IsChildWithParents` but if there were dependencies between the parents, we could end up (1) accepting a low-feerate child or (2) rejecting a high-feerate parent CPFPing another parent. See the \"interdependent parents\" test case for a specific example.\r\n- Be DoS-resistant.\r\n   - Avoid quadratic validation costs.\r\n   - Avoid loading a lot of stuff from disk, or loading repeatedly.\r\n\r\nA description of the package validation logic (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26711#issuecomment-1647523520):\r\n\r\n- Basic sanitization. Quit if it's too big, inconsistent, etc.\r\n- Linearize (Topological sort only)\r\n- **PreChecks loop** For each tx, grab UTXOs to calculate fees and filter out anything we should skip:\r\n    - If already in mempool (or same txid in mempool), mark as skip\r\n    - If missing inputs or conflict, record this failure and mark this and all descendants as skip.\r\n    - If no failures or TX_SINGLE_FAILURE, continue\r\n    - For some failures that we expect due to differing chainstates, skip these transactions and their descendants, but continue.\r\n    - Otherwise, record this failure and mark that we will `quit_early` (i.e. not do the Subpackage validation loop).\r\n- Refine our linearization using the fee information.\r\n- **Subpackage validation loop** For each transaction in the new linearized order:\r\n    - Get the transaction's ancestor subpackage.\r\n    - If the feerate of this transaction is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - If the feerate of this subpackage is insufficient, continue;\r\n    - Otherwise, try to submit the subpackage, using `AcceptSingleTransaction()` if it's just 1 tx\r\n    - if at any point we get a non-fee-related error, abort all.\r\n- Call `LimitMempoolSize`\r\n- Backfill results:\r\n    - If the transaction was in mempool, check to see if it's still there in case it was trimmed in `LimitMempoolSize`.\r\n    - Try to use results from the subpackage validation loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early), use results from prechecks loop.\r\n    - If that doesn't exist (i.e. we quit early and we hadn't found a failure with it yet), fill with `TX_UNKNOWN`.\r\n\r\nThis means we will call `PreChecks` for each transaction 2 times (fewer if we quit early), and run all other validation checks at most 1 time. A transaction shouldn't be validated in the subpackage validation loop more than once.",

          "body": "See #27463 for overall package relay tracking. This PR is in draft while ancestor package validation is being figured out.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A set of policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. Namely, it allows users to opt in to more restrictive descendant limits for shared transactions. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying.\r\n\r\nFAQ: is v3 still helpful even with cluster mempool (#27677) ?\r\n\r\n- Rule 3 pinning: This is addressed with v3 but not really with cluster mempool (descendant allowance is still too permissive).\r\n- Package RBF and ACP pinning: This PR allows for package RBF with v3 packages. V3 has an effective \"cluster limit\" of 2 which makes it very cheap to calculate the mining score of a v3 transaction. With cluster mempool, which also makes it easier to calculate mining score, we could have package RBF for non-v3 transactions.\r\n- Allowing 0fee transactions: This PR allows v3 transactions to be below minimum relay feerate, provided they are CPFP'd. This is because the simplified topology allows us to avoid situations like the ones described in #26933. With cluster mempool, we can allow this for non-v3 transactions.",

(I doubt there are a lot of applications that would opt for using multiple versions of boost in the same build, and if there are it would seem more straightforward for them to put an #include boundary between their application code and libbitcoin_kernel than would be is for this PR to put a boundary between mempool code and the rest of the kernel.)\r\n\r\nBut despite the large diff and long description, the changes in the PR do seem pretty straightforward, so I don't think the benefits need to be that big to justify the changes.",

As a result, the fee estimator would block mempool's `cs` until it finished updating every time a new block was connected.\r\nInstead of being blocked only on mempool tx removal, we were blocking on both tx removal and fee estimator updating.\r\nIf we want to further improve fee estimation, or add heavy-calulation steps to it, it is currently not viable as we would be slowing down block relay in the process\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller in terms of the changes made compared to #11775, as it focuses solely on enabling fee estimator updates from the validationInterface/cscheduler thread notifications.\r\n\r\nI have not split the validation interface because, as I understand it, the rationale behind the split in #11775 was to have `MempoolInterface` signals come from the mempool and `CValidationInterface` events come from validation. I believe this separation can be achieved in a separate refactoring PR when the need arises.\r\n\r\nAlso left out some commits from #11775\r\n- Some refactoring which are no longer needed.\r\n- Handle reorgs much better in fee estimator. \r\n- Track witness hash malleation in fee estimator \r\n\r\nI believe they are a separate change that can come in a follow-up after this.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Concept ACK. I looked at an early version of this and thought generally the same: it's mostly mechanical and not too bad to review.\r\n\r\n> My opinion is would be that if this improves mempool code it should be merged, and if it makes mempool code more complicated or harder to maintain, it should not be merged.\r\n\r\nGenerally agree. I'd also like to hear from some mempool folks. @glozow ?\r\n\r\n> making it easier to compile the kernel library and kernel applications with different versions of boost. (I doubt there are a lot of applications that would opt for using multiple versions of boost in the same build, and if there are it would seem more straightforward for them to put an #include boundary between their application code and libbitcoin_kernel than would be is for this PR to put a boundary between mempool code and the rest of the kernel.)\r\n\r\nI think this glosses over the larger result of this work: boost is now not a requirement for using libbitcoinkernel _at all_. It removes our _last_ external dependency. That's a huge achievement imo. Barring us vendoring Boost, it's the difference between: \"take this lib and build a hello world app in your point-and-click IDE\" to \"use this docker image which includes our recommended version of boost headers to build from a script\". I know, I know, the latter is an exaggeration and wouldn't be the end of the world. But without boost, as-is right now, we'd be able to ship a libbitcoinkernel that depends on only [these headers](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/60da4fa6190e3a85d094f97dc8e578aeabcd22bf#diff-4cb884d03ebb901069e4ee5de5d02538c40dd9b39919c615d8eaa9d364bbbd77R1002-R1096) (though obviously paring down that list is a next step) and nothing from the outside world. To me that's very significant.\r\n\r\n> But despite the large diff and long description, the changes in the PR do seem pretty straightforward, so I don't think the benefits need to be that big to justify the changes.\r\n\r\n+1 though as stated above, to me the benefits _are_ that big :)",

That's a huge achievement imo.\r\n\r\nSounds pretty cool to me.\r\n\r\nI'm also quite interested in this advertised benefit:\r\n\r\n> Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.\r\n\r\n> My opinion is would be that if this improves mempool code it should be merged, and if it makes mempool code more complicated or harder to maintain, it should not be merged.\r\n\r\nI think the size of the diff is a symptom of lots of code external to txmempool knowing a bit too much about how txmempool is implemented, i.e. accessing `mapTx`  when it should probably use a different `CTxMemPool` method to get the information it needs. Adding `.impl` in those areas seems a bit ugly tbh - I think a cleaner approach would be to have those bits of code not use txiter/mapTx/setEntries. Apart from that, it seems generally good to move more of the implementation inward. I just had 1 comment about `UpdateForDescendants`.\r\n\r\n[This branch](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/tree/2023-08-reduce-nonmempool-boost) refactors some of these `mapTx` accesses to use things like `infoAll()` and `GetIter()` and `size()`, which imo are the more appropriate functions to be calling there. The result is that a lot of things don't need to be pimpl'd anymore or fewer places are using the pimpl'd data structures. I rebased this PR on top of that branch, which resulted in 7 commits being unnecessary and the pimpling commits touching fewer files. The overall diff isn't that much smaller, but I think it achieves the intended result + independently nice changes.\r\n\r\nI sorted the commits from most trivial to least trivial - the first ones are very straightforward things like \"call pool.size() instead of pool.mapTx.size().\" The last part re-implements `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` to not need a boost multi index container, which I suppose could be controversial. Would you maybe be interested in taking any of these changes?",

      "body": "> I think this glosses over the larger result of this work: boost is now not a requirement for using libbitcoinkernel _at all_.\r\n\r\nYes this is a distinction I glossed over and didn't think much about. With this PR, boost is still a requirement for building libbitcoinkernel, but not a requirement for using it.\r\n\r\nBut I don't understand what the big advantage is (other than the ones already mentioned about speeding up build times or mixing versions of boost). And I don't undestand or what you are saying about the docker image and IDE. To my mind there are two type of developers who might want to use libbitcoinkernel:\r\n\r\n1. Developers who will want to use a packaged version of libbitcoinkernel in the form of a vcpkg, conan, nix, or wherever other package.\r\n2. Developers who will take a more DIY approach and put libbitcoinkernel in a vendor branch or monorepo or something like that.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this PR seems negligible in both of this cases, probably resulting in literal 1-line change like fd49dc99398a3ec331f393f877ec9ae804373043 removing a path from the include list.\r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing maybe the thing you are enthusiastic about is supporting a third type of developer who (1) doesn't want to use a package and (2) doesn't want to build from source, but instead wants to download a tarball containing a precompiled libbitcoinkernel library binary and some headers, and use that. But the difference is pretty small in this case too, no? Without this PR the tarball needs to contain a few boost header files, and with this PR, it doesn't.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm happy about the benefits of this PR, but just think the main consideration here should be whether it improves the mempool code or not, and glad to see glozow had some suggestions for simplifying it.",

I'll admit to complete tunnel-vision on this particular boost removal. It's been ~an obsession~ a goal of mine for long enough that I'm probably too biased to judge the code changes required for it. And as you said, I don't think i need to belabor that point anyway when there's other merit to the changes.\r\n\r\n@glozow thanks for taking a look!  Seems getting rid of some of the direct uses of `mapTx` would be a nice cleanup even outside of this PR?",

This left two functions with largely overlapping purpose, where one was simply a wrapper of the other. This PR cleans up the overlap, and fixes the double-meaning of `change_cost` where the `GetChange()` function assumed that no change was created when `change_cost` was set to 0. This behavior was exploited in a bunch of tests, but is problematic, because a `change_cost` of 0 is permitted with custom settings for feerate and discard_feerate (i.e. when they’re both 0).\r\n\r\nRequires #26152, only last two commits are new.",

      "body": "Re https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28335#pullrequestreview-1603077161\r\n\r\nThank you for taking so much consideration for this change! I think your additional patches are well worth reducing the amount of code that has to directly access the boost data structure from outside of the `CTxMemPool` class.\r\n\r\n> Would you maybe be interested in taking any of these changes?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes (as you mentioned) should be uncontroversial, e.g. just directly using existing helpers, or the `vTxHashes` changes. I'll gladly integrate these here. \r\n\r\nI think the `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` change would merit its own PRs, since it does change the internal behavior and performance somewhat. \r\n\r\nThe other two cases I am not sure about is using `infoAll()` (as done [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commit/c287d8dc5df644b04fa9b4ffc62c8537ce76730a#diff-9c5b83de6dc84af277e352c88b9291aa44340a3c75f572a0b51661eb0a838de9R347)) to create a vector of `TxMemPoolInfo` instead of directly iterating over `mapTx` and construction of a new `GenTxid` [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commit/971133f2ed0237c9473307f292bc365c47f7de0b#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98R362). In both cases it would be fairly straight forward to replace them with new  `CTxMemPool` helper methods if they prove too controversial. ",

I think these are well worth it for both cleaning up the code to not needlessly reach into complex mempool member variables as well as reducing the number of source files that need to include the multiindex headers.\r\n\r\nThe order of the commits was slightly changed, the heavier `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` refactor is now the first commit. As a further approach I think two separate PRs should be opened; one for the heavier `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` and related changes as well as another one for the easier refactors. Once these are processed, this current PR can be rebased and opened for code review.",

This PR simplifies that one.\r\n\r\nThings done in this PR:\r\n- Add a bench for `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` where we reorg and the new chain has {100%, 90%, 10%} of the same transactions. AFAIU in practice, it's usually close to 100%.\r\n- Rewrite `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` as a `std::list` + `unordered_map` instead of a boost multi index container.\r\n  - On my machine, the bench suggests the performance is very similar.\r\n- Move `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` from txmempool.h to its own kernel/disconnected_transactions.h. This struct isn't used by txmempool and doesn't have much to do with txmempool. My guess is that it's been living there for convenience since the boost includes are there.\r\n",

          "body": "Motivation\r\n* It seems preferable to use stdlib data structures instead of boost if they can achieve close to the same thing.\r\n* Code external to mempool should ideally use its public helper methods instead of accessing `mapTx` or its iterators directly.\r\n* Reduce the number of complex boost multi index type interactions\r\n* Also see #28335 for further context/motivation. This PR together with #28385 simplifies that one.\r\n\r\nOverview of things done in this PR:\r\n* Make `vTxHashes` a vector of transaction references instead of a pair of transaction hash and iterator. The trade off here is that the iterator is retrieved on the fly with `get_iter_from_wtxid` instead of being cached in `vTxHashes`.\r\n* Introduce `GetEntry` helper method to replace the more involved `GetIter` where applicable\r\n* Replace `mapTx` access with `CTxMemPool` helper methods\r\n  * Please note when reviewing that `infoAll` is already in other places that grab all mempool transactions as well, such as in net_processing when responding to bip35 messages.\r\n* Simplify `checkChainLimits` call in `node/interfaces.cpp`\r\n* Make `MiniMinerMempoolEntry` ctor more explicit\r\n* Make `CTxMemPoolEntry`s `lockPoints`mutable such that they can be changed with a const iterator directly instead of going through `mapTx`\r\n* Make `BlockAssembler`'s `inBlock` and `failedTx` sets of transaction hashes.",

          "body": "This PR implements receiving silent payment transactions through the use of a new `ScriptPubKeyMan` type: `SilentPaymentsSPKM`. This is a descriptor wallet only feature, although it does not use descriptors.\r\n\r\nThis is an optional feature, so the only way to use it is to create a new wallet with `createwallet` with `silent_payments=true`. Such wallets will have a single `SilentPaymentsSPKM` that is used for both receiving and change. Since silent payments only have a single address, repeated calls to `getnewaddress` and `getrawchangeaddress` always return the same address, however the receiving and change addresses are different, see the BIP for how the change is generated.\r\n\r\nSince silent payments requires the spent coins in order to extract public keys from them, `TransactionAddedToMempool` is modified to also provide that information. For scanning blocks, the wallet will retrieve that information from the undo data. Additionally, when rescanning, a silent payments wallet must use the slow rescan method.\r\n\r\nThe labels feature has not been fully implemented yet and is left for a followup.\r\n\r\nBased on #28122 and #28201 \r\n\r\nAlternative to #28202",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [ ] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick)\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add mempool transactions in a topologically-invalid way.\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts. Is this a problem?",
