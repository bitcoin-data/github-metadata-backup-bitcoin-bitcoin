    "body": "Similarly to #28327 I wanted to open this PR to receive some opinions and better approaches.\r\n\r\nThe kernel library is currently at the stage where unwanted headers are removed from its set of headers. In practice, this means we are reducing the number of includes that are required for compiling the experimental `bitcoin-chainstate` binary. This is described in stage 1 step 3 of the [project tracking issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).\r\n\r\nCurrently the mempool is part of the kernel library. The mempool headers include the boost multi index headers. Thus any application wanting to use the kernel library and its headers will have to include the boost headers too. This is not only undesirable because of the sheer size of these headers, but also might lead to conflicts if the including application uses a different boost version.\r\n\r\nIn the approach laid out by this PR, mempool member variables and methods are declared in the header without having to include boost by either wrapping them in a struct and [pimpling](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) them, or making methods static implementation functions. The boost definitions are gathered into separate header (`mempool_set_definitions.h`) that is only included by implementation files that require definitions of the boost types. This allows us to retain the current architecture with roughly the same interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe approach laid out by this PR also has some, albeit small, compilation speed and size benefits. Averaged over a few of compilation runs I consistently observe faster compilation by a couple of seconds and some smaller pre-processed and compiled object sizes. The main detractor of this method is obviously the number of lines touched. However it also has the benefit of inventorizing all the files that require direct access to the mempool data structures as well getting rid of boost multi index includes in non-kernel implementation files that include the mempool, but don't directly manipulate its data structures (e.g. wallet.cpp).\r\n\r\nA much simpler alternative approach, at least on the surface, would be removing all `txmempool.h` includes from kernel library headers (see [this branch](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/mempoolBoostSimple)). Currently this is only `validation.h`.  Due to the mutex member of `CTxMemPool` and the correspondingly defined lock decorators on the chainstate methods this becomes a bit more complicated though and I am not sure how this might be possible with the current architecture.\r\n\r\nA discussion of how and if to remove the mempool from the kernel library has so far been intentionally punted to the next stage of the kernel library development. Pimpling the mempool itself precludes this discussion, since the library could never be shipped with the `CTxMemPool` headers. Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.",

          "body": "See #27463 for overall package relay tracking. This PR is in draft while ancestor package validation is being figured out.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A set of policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. Namely, it allows users to opt in to more restrictive descendant limits for shared transactions. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying.\r\n\r\nFAQ: is v3 still helpful even with cluster mempool (#27677) ?\r\n\r\n- Rule 3 pinning: This is addressed with v3 but not really with cluster mempool (descendant allowance is still too permissive).\r\n- Package RBF and ACP pinning: This PR allows for package RBF with v3 packages. V3 has an effective \"cluster limit\" of 2 which makes it very cheap to calculate the mining score of a v3 transaction. With cluster mempool, which also makes it easier to calculate mining score, we could have package RBF for non-v3 transactions.\r\n- Allowing 0fee transactions: This PR allows v3 transactions to be below minimum relay feerate, provided they are CPFP'd. This is because the simplified topology allows us to avoid situations like the ones described in #26933. With cluster mempool, we can allow this for non-v3 transactions.",

          "body": "This is an attempt to  #11775 \r\n\r\nThis Pr will enable fee estimator to listen to ValidationInterface notifications to process new transactions added and removed from the mempool.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Added a new callback to the Validation Interface `MempoolBlockConnect`, which notifies listeners about the transactions that have been removed due to a new block being connected, along with the height at which the block was removed.\r\n- Modified the `TransactionAddedToMempool` callback parameter to include additional information about the transaction needed for fee estimation.\r\n- Updated `CBlockPolicyEstimator` to process transactions using` CTransactionRef` instead of `CTxMempoolEntry.`\r\n- Implemented the `CValidationInterface` interface in `CBlockPolicyEstimater` and overridden the `TransactionAddedToMempool`, `TransactionRemovedFromMempool`, and `MempoolBlockConnect` methods to receive updates from their notifications.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the fee estimator updates from the mempool. When a new block was connected, all transactions in the block that were present in our mempool were removed using the `removeForBlock` function in `txmempool.cpp`. \r\n\r\nThis removal triggered updates to the fee estimator. As a result, the fee estimator would block mempool's `cs` until it finished updating every time a new block was connected.\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller in terms of the changes made compared to #11775, as it focuses solely on enabling fee estimator updates from the validationInterface/cscheduler thread notifications.\r\n\r\nI have not split the validation interface because, as I understand it, the rationale behind the split in #11775 was to have `MempoolInterface` signals come from the mempool and `CValidationInterface` events come from validation. I believe this separation can be achieved in a separate refactoring PR when the need arises.\r\n\r\nAlso left out some commits from #11775\r\n- Some refactoring which are no longer needed.\r\n- Handle reorgs much better in fee estimator. \r\n- Track witness hash malleation in fee estimator \r\n\r\nI believe they are a separate change that can come in a follow-up after this.\r\n\r\nLeaving this in a draft while seeking Concept and Approach ACK.\r\n",

      "body": "Concept ACK. I looked at an early version of this and thought generally the same: it's mostly mechanical and not too bad to review.\r\n\r\n> My opinion is would be that if this improves mempool code it should be merged, and if it makes mempool code more complicated or harder to maintain, it should not be merged.\r\n\r\nGenerally agree. I'd also like to hear from some mempool folks. @glozow ?\r\n\r\n> making it easier to compile the kernel library and kernel applications with different versions of boost. (I doubt there are a lot of applications that would opt for using multiple versions of boost in the same build, and if there are it would seem more straightforward for them to put an #include boundary between their application code and libbitcoin_kernel than would be is for this PR to put a boundary between mempool code and the rest of the kernel.)\r\n\r\nI think this glosses over the larger result of this work: boost is now not a requirement for using libbitcoinkernel _at all_. It removes our _last_ external dependency. That's a huge achievement imo. Barring us vendoring Boost, it's the difference between: \"take this lib and build a hello world app in your point-and-click IDE\" to \"use this docker image which includes our recommended version of boost headers to build from a script\". I know, I know, the latter is an exaggeration and wouldn't be the end of the world. But without boost, as-is right now, we'd be able to ship a libbitcoinkernel that depends on only [these headers](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/60da4fa6190e3a85d094f97dc8e578aeabcd22bf#diff-4cb884d03ebb901069e4ee5de5d02538c40dd9b39919c615d8eaa9d364bbbd77R1002-R1096) (though obviously paring down that list is a next step) and nothing from the outside world. To me that's very significant.\r\n\r\n> But despite the large diff and long description, the changes in the PR do seem pretty straightforward, so I don't think the benefits need to be that big to justify the changes.\r\n\r\n+1 though as stated above, to me the benefits _are_ that big :)",

      "body": "> boost is now not a requirement for using libbitcoinkernel _at all_. It removes our _last_ external dependency. That's a huge achievement imo.\r\n\r\nSounds pretty cool to me.\r\n\r\nI'm also quite interested in this advertised benefit:\r\n\r\n> Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.\r\n\r\n> My opinion is would be that if this improves mempool code it should be merged, and if it makes mempool code more complicated or harder to maintain, it should not be merged.\r\n\r\nI think the size of the diff is a symptom of lots of code external to txmempool knowing a bit too much about how txmempool is implemented, i.e. accessing `mapTx`  when it should probably use a different `CTxMemPool` method to get the information it needs. Adding `.impl` in those areas seems a bit ugly tbh - I think a cleaner approach would be to have those bits of code not use txiter/mapTx/setEntries. Apart from that, it seems generally good to move more of the implementation inward. I just had 1 comment about `UpdateForDescendants`.\r\n\r\n[This branch](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/tree/2023-08-reduce-nonmempool-boost) refactors some of these `mapTx` accesses to use things like `infoAll()` and `GetIter()` and `size()`, which imo are the more appropriate functions to be calling there. The result is that a lot of things don't need to be pimpl'd anymore or fewer places are using the pimpl'd data structures. I rebased this PR on top of that branch, which resulted in 7 commits being unnecessary and the pimpling commits touching fewer files. The overall diff isn't that much smaller, but I think it achieves the intended result + independently nice changes.\r\n\r\nI sorted the commits from most trivial to least trivial - the first ones are very straightforward things like \"call pool.size() instead of pool.mapTx.size().\" The last part re-implements `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` to not need a boost multi index container, which I suppose could be controversial. Would you maybe be interested in taking any of these changes?",

      "body": "> I think this glosses over the larger result of this work: boost is now not a requirement for using libbitcoinkernel _at all_.\r\n\r\nYes this is a distinction I glossed over and didn't think much about. With this PR, boost is still a requirement for building libbitcoinkernel, but not a requirement for using it.\r\n\r\nBut I don't understand what the big advantage is (other than the ones already mentioned about speeding up build times or mixing versions of boost). And I don't undestand or what you are saying about the docker image and IDE. To my mind there are two type of developers who might want to use libbitcoinkernel:\r\n\r\n1. Developers who will want to use a packaged version of libbitcoinkernel in the form of a vcpkg, conan, nix, or wherever other package.\r\n2. Developers who will take a more DIY approach and put libbitcoinkernel in a vendor branch or monorepo or something like that.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this PR seems negligible in both of this cases, probably resulting in literal 1-line change like fd49dc99398a3ec331f393f877ec9ae804373043 removing a path from the include list.\r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing maybe the thing you are enthusiastic about is supporting a third type of developer who (1) doesn't want to use a package and (2) doesn't want to build from source, but instead wants to download a tarball containing a precompiled libbitcoinkernel library binary and some headers, and use that. But the difference is pretty small in this case too, no? Without this PR the tarball needs to contain a few boost header files, and with this PR, it doesn't.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm happy about the benefits of this PR, but just think the main consideration here should be whether it improves the mempool code or not, and glad to see glozow had some suggestions for simplifying it.",

I'll admit to complete tunnel-vision on this particular boost removal. It's been ~an obsession~ a goal of mine for long enough that I'm probably too biased to judge the code changes required for it. And as you said, I don't think i need to belabor that point anyway when there's other merit to the changes.\r\n\r\n@glozow thanks for taking a look!  Seems getting rid of some of the direct uses of `mapTx` would be a nice cleanup even outside of this PR?",

      "body": "Re https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28335#pullrequestreview-1603077161\r\n\r\nThank you for taking so much consideration for this change! I think your additional patches are well worth reducing the amount of code that has to directly access the boost data structure from outside of the `CTxMemPool` class.\r\n\r\n> Would you maybe be interested in taking any of these changes?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes (as you mentioned) should be uncontroversial, e.g. just directly using existing helpers, or the `vTxHashes` changes. I'll gladly integrate these here. \r\n\r\nI think the `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` change would merit its own PRs, since it does change the internal behavior and performance somewhat. \r\n\r\nThe other two cases I am not sure about is using `infoAll()` (as done [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commit/c287d8dc5df644b04fa9b4ffc62c8537ce76730a#diff-9c5b83de6dc84af277e352c88b9291aa44340a3c75f572a0b51661eb0a838de9R347)) to create a vector of `TxMemPoolInfo` instead of directly iterating over `mapTx` and construction of a new `GenTxid` [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commit/971133f2ed0237c9473307f292bc365c47f7de0b#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98R362). In both cases it would be fairly straight forward to replace them with new  `CTxMemPool` helper methods if they prove too controversial. ",
