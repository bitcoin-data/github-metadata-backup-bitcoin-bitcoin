    "body": "This PR proposes to introduce a new subsystem for anomaly detection and notifications of those for corrective behaviors. It showcases a proof-of-concept laying out the design of such a new system with a new heuristic.\r\n\r\nPrevention of eclipse-attacks and network partitions is critical for application security and user funds.  Beyond fork detection and obvious protocol misbehavior, Bitcoin Core doesn't implement any active anomalies detection. These vulnerabilities may be even more destructive for time-sensitive protocol with harder [security assumptions](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-December/002369.html), such as those requiring real-time block processing with regards to honest majority network. Active detection at the base-layer, where it's easier to monitor, may be used in two ways:\r\na) With an application, like a payment system or a LN node, cutting its deposit flow or closing its channels in reaction or stopping HTLC processing, and therefore limiting exposure.\r\nb) With an internal Bitcoin Core module, triggering rescue header-fetching -- see the [AltNet subsystem proposal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18988) as an example of consumer usage.\r\n\r\nEven if notifications must be interpreted according to application requirements, such _automatic_ reactions, well-implemented, would be a positive increase for their security.\r\n\r\nDetection may rely on a wide range of cross-layer heuristics, including the local clock, packets RTT, ASN distribution among addrman, abnormal peer rotation, stalling or delayed block issuance, mempool congestion and bandwidth consumption surges. You may combine heuristics to increase confidence, but due to the p2p nature of the network or Poisson block interval false positives must be taken into account. Ideally consumer would be able to fine-tune their false-positives exposure with regards to application security and the cost of their reaction.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new module (`CWatchdog`), with low-reliance on other modules beyond synchronous events harvesting (`LogHeader`). Anomalie detections (`ScanAnomalie`) is scheduled each `SCAN_ANOMALIES_INTERVAL` on its own thread. Integration is done with `NodeContext`, making the module accessible to future RPCs. A subscription interface (`CWatchdogInterface`) is added, the model of `CValidationInterface`. This can host the actual fork detection in the future after refactoring `CheckForkWarningConditions`.\r\n\r\nThis new module, less intertwined with current code can be disabled by default, and only activated with `--enable-watchdog` by node operators willingly to use it.",

      "body": "Honestly, I've not been that far in the design of a specific hook interface servicing watchdog/statistical tools.\r\n\r\nThis PoC was relying on a `CWatchdogInterface` inspired from the current `CValidationInterface`. Though one of the prevailing feedback I received with this proposal was that it would be far better to have the module separated in another runtime, and even external to Bitcoin Core internals or build system. Thus letting _any_ module to be plugged in.\r\n\r\nOne solution I'm working on is pursuing on the work done by multiprocess with the newly introduced abstract interfaces (`src/interfaces`), where your potential external modules could be written in Rust to talk directly to core C++ code through Cap'n Proto or in the future another protocol (fyi, see https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/56).\r\n\r\nOf course, w.r.t to event collection, the USDT approach you're proposing sounds the right tool. One could imagine a watchdog module where the low-level event collection is gathered through tracing and the high-level corrective logic relying on a `*.capnp` interface, all bundled in the same runtime.\r\n\r\n> This could be done with the net tracepoints for inbound / outbound P2P messages. See this example https://bitcoind.observer/p2p-network-traffic and code https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoind-observer.\r\n\r\nI need to think more, but I think tracepoints could cover the whole range of proposed heuristics: local clock, packets RTT, peer rotation frequency, mempool feerate groups, ... ?\r\n\r\n> Let if you think this might be an alternative to a module in Bitcoin Core. Happy to chat.\r\n\r\nFirst impression, I think this tracepoint approach is far better than yet-another-non-critical-module in core for sure. Yeah happy to chat, on this PR, a new issue or irc :)",
