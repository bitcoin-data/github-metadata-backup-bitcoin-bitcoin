    "body": "The **Progress increase per hour** metric is displayed with the unit **%** (see image). This seems wrong, since a change in percentage should be presented as **percentage points** or **percentage units**. Maybe not a huge problem, but I for one found it confusing when I first saw it. \r\n\r\nI would have preferred to submit a PR changing to **percentage points**, but that would add a translation term. So, In order to keep the change small, I suggest the abbreviation **%p**, which seems to be commonly used ([albeit \"non-standard\"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%25p#English)). Everybody knows the **%** symbol, and if they are not familiar with **%p** they can still get the main idea of the metric.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,  **pp** can be used. This abbreviation seems to be even more common for English speaking users, but may not be familiar to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nOr should it be added as a new translation term? (Could also be done as the next step)\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"956\" alt=\"progress_increase_per_h\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/453092/47361317-e4cdc680-d6d1-11e8-97a4-528d7432322b.png\">\r\n",

So I tried to really think about what the experience would be like for a new user. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, I did figure out that the value most likely was referring to percentage points, but I was not 100% sure, and thinking about this took a big chunk of my attention focus as a new user. The user should not have to think about what the UI is telling him/her, it should be crystal clear.  Maybe the hourly progress increase should be removed altogether, or - better - replaced with some graphical component (like a histogram with sync speed history since the sync started).   \r\n",

      "body": "@WetPuppyKisses Thanks for commenting. \r\nYes, an explanatory tooltip could be used to tell the user what is going on. It would still need addition of a translation term, though. \r\nAnd, as I commented earlier, the message from the UI to the user should be crystal clear. If possible, no detailed explanation should be needed. UX is hard... \r\n\r\nI mentioned that a graphical component could be used. Below is an example of a download progress bar that illustrates the concept. (This is just an image I found using Google)\r\nThe user can clearly see if the sync speed has increased or decreased during the sync progress.
