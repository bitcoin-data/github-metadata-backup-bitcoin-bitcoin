    "body": "Per-peer `m_tx_inventory_to_send` queues have CPU and memory costs that scale with both queue size and peer count. Under high transaction volume, this has previously caused severe issues ([May 2023 disclosure][1]) and still can cause measurable delays ([Feb 2026 Runestone surge][2], with the msghand thread observed hitting 100% CPU and queue memory reaching ~95MB).\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the per-peer rate limiting with a global queue using dual token buckets (limiting transaction by both count and serialized size). Transactions that arrive within the bucket capacity still relay nearly immediately, but excess transactions queue in a global backlog and drain as the token buckets refill.\r\n\r\nKey parameters:\r\n  - Count bucket: 14 tx/s, 420 capacity (30s buffer)\r\n  - Size bucket: 20 kB/s (~12 MB/600s), 50 MB capacity\r\n  - Outbound peers refill faster by a factor of 2.5\r\n  \r\nPer-peer queues are retained solely for privacy batching and are always fully emptied, removing the old `INVENTORY_BROADCAST_MAX` cap.\r\n\r\nThis reduces the memory and CPU burden during transaction spikes when the queuing logic is engaged from O(queue * peers) to O(queue), as the queued transactions no longer need to be retained per-peer or re-sorted per-peer.\r\n\r\nDesign discussion: https://gist.github.com/ajtowns/d61bea974a07190fa6c6c8eaef3638b9\r\n\r\n[1]: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2024/10/08/disclose-large-inv-to-send/\r\n[2]: https://bnoc.xyz/t/increased-b-msghand-thread-utilization-due-to-runestone-transactions-on-2026-02-17/81\r\n",

Limit the impact of this\nby providing a global rate limit.\n\nThis is implemented using dual token buckets, one that consumes a\ntoken for every transaction, and one that consumes a token for every\nserialized byte. This rate limits both per-tx resource usage (eg INV\nmessages) and overall relay bandwidth.\n\nMain bucket parameters:\n * Count: 14tx/s rate, 420tx (30s) capacity\n * Size: 12MB/600s rate (4-6 blocks per target block interval), 50MB capacity\n\nThe size bucket is expected to be large enough to almost never have an\nimpact in normal usage, even during transaction storms, and is primarily\nintended to mitigate attack-like scenarios.\n\nOutbound connections get a separate pair of buckets, with rates boosted\nby a 2.5x multiplier.\n\nThis avoids the excessive memory and CPU usage due to the 100x multiplier\nfrom the queues being per-peer.\n\nNote that this also reduces the size of INV messages we send for general\ntx relay back to a more reasonable level of under 600 txs in 99.999%\nof cases.",
