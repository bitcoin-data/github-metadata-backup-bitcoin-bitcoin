    "body": "bitcoind now supports loading more than one wallet at once.\n\nA singleton object of type CWalletManager now exists. It handles dynamic loading/unloading and synchronization of wallets and allows different parts of the application to access wallets by name.\n\nA new CWallet\\* parameter has been added to the RPC functions. Functions which do not use a wallet simply ignore it. In addition, a new field has been added to CRPCCommand that tells us whether or not the function can be called on a wallet.\n\nWallet-specific information has been removed from RPC method getinfo. Instead, getinfo just reports how many\nwallets are currently loaded. Detailed wallet info is now available via the listwallets method.\n\nFour new RPC methods have been added:\n- listwallets\n  Returns an array containing wallet information.\n- usewallet <walletname> <method> [params] \n  Allows you to apply existing RPC commands to different wallets.\n  A default wallet named the empty string is always loaded and is used if calls are made without usewallet.\n  Example: bitcoind usewallet foo listreceivedbyaddress 0 true\n  (thanks, gmaxwell, for the idea)\n- loadwallet <walletname> [rescan=false] [upgradewallet=false] [maxversion=(latest)]\n  Dynamically loads an existing wallet file wallet-<walletname>.dat.\n  If no wallet file exists a new wallet is created. The default wallet file is always called wallet.dat.\n- unloadwallet <walletname>\n\nTo specify additional wallets at startup, use option -usewallet=foo -usewallet=bar etc...as detailed here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2124#issuecomment-11653964 and https://github.com/CodeShark/bitcoin/commit/9d201cfaf9f54042ec0ff8265cd2201545568b6d\n\nTODO:\n- Clean up I/O in CWalletManager::LoadWallet - debug, error, and UI output functions.\n- Check synchronization code.\n- Test mining functionality. Allow RPC mining on arbitrary wallets.\n- Integrate with Qt.\n",

Upon initialization, multiple wallets can be loaded.\n\nA new CWallet* parameter has been added to the RPC functions. Functions which do not use a wallet simply ignore it. In addition, a new field has been added to CRPCCommand that tells us whether or not the function uses a wallet.\n\nTwo new RPC methods have been added:\n  1) listwallets - Returns an array containing wallet names.\n  2) usewallet - Prefix existing wallet RPC calls with usewallet <walletname> to use a particular wallet. If no wallet is specified, the default wallet is used.\n    example: bitcoind usewallet foo listreceivedbyaddress 0 true\n\nTODO:\n  1) Get wallet names from bitcoin.conf in init.cpp.\n  2) Change help RPC so that the message does not depend on wallet state (i.e. walletpassphrase RPC call)",

I put off coding there since I expected something like this to come along and because commentary on the pull request died away.\n\nI can't review the code in detail now but this capability needs to happen. Passing CWallet \\* around is an improvement for sure, definitely better than another global. I'm finding it kinda cringeworth-brittle from an OO perspective, though. It would be lovely to see new RPC functions implemented in ways that drag suitable amounts of code that depends strongly on the wallet's internal representation out along with them the appropriate changes to the wallet object.\n\nHave you tried merging my code? I'll have to look at that later. Multiple wallets are useful for any number of reasons. Certainly the Bitcoin-only accountants and would-be tax collectors of the future aren't going to be running _n_ instances of bitcoind on their desktops.\n\nUltimate I think the wallet should be decoupled from the rest of the satoshi client. Pushing standarized interfaces down to wallet-object level is somewhere on the road to getting there. You seem to be addressing some modularization issues in other areas though, too.\n",

Furthermore, a listening agent could send alerts to other components without the need to store any transactions. For instance, it could just provide filtering.\n\nHaving said that, in the interest of seeing these pull requests merged with bitcoin/bitcoin master ASAP, I'm willing to do things incrementally and use whatever structures already exist for now. However, I'd be very interested in giving all this some deeper thought and coming up with a serious reorganization for some later version.\n\nAs for now, at the very least it is possible to encapsulate the existing CWallet class much better - and I applaud your efforts.\n",

      "body": "In general: I'm very much in favor of having native support for multiple wallets. Wallet stuff hasn't been a priority for some time, but if necessary I'd like to help to get this working.\n\nRegarding the idea of separating wallets for block chain processing: sure, that's definitely where we need to go in the future. Ideally, I think the code evolves to separate wallet and the rest along a clean interface in a first step indeed. In a second step, we can maybe make them separate processes started from the same binary or even just separate binaries with shared codebase. The final aim should be entirely separate things, either communicating via some private \"wallet interconnect protocol\" (where several wallets on a trusted network connect to a single validation service), or even turning the wallet processes into standalone SPV clients (with their own blockheader-chain), that can either connect directly to the network, or can connect to a server provide block/tx validation service, simply via the P2P protocol.\n",

Currently bitcoind is slowly becoming bloated with both, and a focus on making the split possible might be useful.\n",

      "body": "This is awesome work. I hope it makes it way to BTC soon.   I've been playing with it for a bit now. Here are the issues I am working through. \n1) Export doesn't work. ( Tried making BitCoinGui exportAction public and referencing it in WalletView::gotoHistoryPage but that only gives me default wallet) Still working on different methods to fix this.\n2) The RPC commands loadwallet and unloadwallet do not reflect in gui. I think the gui needs a connect to rpc commands.\n3) When clicking on the transaction on the right side of the gui, the transaction button doesn't get focus.\n4) The gui can't create a new wallet. using loadwallet then unloadwallet rcp, then load button in gui works, but..\n\nSo far these are the only issues I have found.  \n\nThanks again for the hard work. I'll share what I can when as I work through these changes. I am still new and trying to catchup as quick as possible. Any hints are appreciated it.\n\nHappy Bitcoining!\n",
