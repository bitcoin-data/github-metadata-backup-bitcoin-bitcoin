After digging deeper into the `VerifyScript()` function though I think this is only true for native txs (w/o SegWit). With SegWit involved, in the following part, in the function `ExecuteWitnessScript()` it could happen that after running the witness script the stack is empty, but still `SCRIPT_ERR_CLEANSTACK` is thrown:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1b313cacc99a1b372238f9036abed5491f9d28f7/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1516-L1522\r\n\r\nDon't know though if that is intended or it was just forgotten to implicitely check for empty and return `SCRIPT_ERR_EVAL_FALSE` in this place. (For practical matters it shouldn't make a difference, in any case the script fails).",

See \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20006#issuecomment-698487304 for motivation. \r\n\r\nSecond commit: The stack size for witness programs was being explicitly resized to 1 to get around \r\n`CLEANSTACK` check. This commits removes that logic and does some code cleanup. This commit\r\nmay require careful review to see if this does not change anything unintended. \r\n\r\nThird commit: Refactor `MINIMALIF` to `WITNESS_MINIMALIF` and changes the error message. \r\n\r\n The Tapscript related error codes were handled in #19953.
