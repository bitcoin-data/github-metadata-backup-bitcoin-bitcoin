    "body": "Fixes #20934 by using the \"sync up\" method described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20538#issuecomment-738791868.\r\n\r\nAfter improving robustness with this approach (commits 1-3), it turned out that there were still some fails, but those were unrelated to zmq: Out of 500 runs, 3 times `sync_mempool()` or `sync_blocks()` timed out, which can happen because the trickle relay time has no upper bound -- hence in rare cases, it takes longer than 60s. This is fixed by enabling immediate tx relay on node1 (commit 4), which as a nice side-effect also gives us a rough 2x speedup for the test.\r\n\r\nFor further details, also see the explanations in the commit messages.\r\n\r\nThere is no guarantee that the test is still not flaky, but it would help if potential reviewers would run the following script locally and report how many runs failed (feel free to do less than 1000 runs, as this takes quite a long if ran with `--valgrind`):\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nOUTPUT_FILE=./zmq_results\r\necho ===== repeated zmq test ===== > $OUTPUT_FILE\r\n\r\nfor i in `seq 1000`; do\r\n    echo ------------------------\r\n    echo ----- test run $i -----\r\n    echo ------------------------\r\n    echo --- $i --- >> $OUTPUT_FILE\r\n    ./test/functional/interface_zmq.py --valgrind\r\n    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\r\n        echo \"FAILED. /o\\\\\" >> $OUTPUT_FILE\r\n    else\r\n        echo \"PASSED. \\\\o/\" >> $OUTPUT_FILE\r\n    fi\r\ndone\r\n\r\necho Failed test runs:\r\ngrep FAILED $OUTPUT_FILE | wc -l\r\n```",

      "body": "@MarcoFalke: Thanks, that helped a lot! On master, running via `--valgrind` leads to a failed test run quite quickly on my machine.\r\n\r\nThe PR is ready for review now. The problem of my original approach was that most tests needed nodes 0 and 1 to have the same tip. So, after this robust \"sync up\" setup approach of repeatedly generating blocks, node 1 has to catch up. Added a parameter \"sync_blocks\" for that purpose, as for the last test, the chains are already different and synchronization is not possible in a trivial way. Now, I had locally a few hundred test runs with `--valgrind` and all of them passed.\r\nAlso adapted the PR description to include a script, that reviewers can use to test the robustness.\r\n",

Currently this is handled by just waiting\nfor a short period of time (200ms), which works most of the time but is\nstill problematic, as in some rare cases the setup time takes much\nlonger, even in the range of multiple seconds.\n\nThe solution in this commit approaches the problem by using a more\nrobust method of syncing up, originally proposed by instagibbs:\n    1. Generate a block on the node\n    2. Try to receive a notification on all subscribers\n    3. If all subscribers get a message within the timeout (1 second),\n       we are done, otherwise repeat starting from step 1",
