    "body": "The definition of dust is redefined to remove the factor of 3.\r\n\r\nDust is redefined to be the value of an output such that it would\r\ncost that value in fees to (create and) spend the output at the dust\r\nrelay rate.  The previous definition was that it would cost 1/3 of the\r\nvalue.  The default dust relay rate is correspondingly increased to\r\n3000 sat/kB so the actual default dust output value of 546 satoshis\r\nfor a non-segwit output remains unchanged.  This commit is a refactor\r\nonly unless a dustrelayfee is passed on the commandline in which case\r\nthat number now needs to be increased by a factor of 3 to get the same\r\nbehavior.  -dustrelayfee is a hidden command line option.\r\n\r\nNote: It's not exactly a refactor due to edge case changes in rounding\r\nas evidenced by the required change to the unit test.\r\n\r\nA discard_rate is added which defaults to 10,000 sat/kB\r\n\r\nAny change output which would be dust at the discard_rate you are\r\nwilling to discard completely and add to fee (as well as continuing to\r\npay the fee that would have been needed for creating the change)\r\n\r\nThis would be a nice addition for 0.15 and I think will remain useful for 0.16 with the new coin selection algorithms in discussion, but its not crucial.\r\n\r\nIt does add translation strings, but we could (should?) avoid that by hiding the option",

The previous definition was that it would cost 1/3 of the\nvalue.  The default dust relay rate is correspondingly increased to\n3000 sat/kB so the actual default dust output value of 546 satoshis\nfor a non-segwit output remains unchanged.  This commit is a refactor\nonly unless a dustrelayfee is passed on the commandline in which case\nthat number now needs to be increased by a factor of 3 to get the same\nbehavior.  -dustrelayfee is a hidden command line option.\n\nNote: It's not exactly a refactor due to edge case changes in rounding\nas evidenced by the required change to the unit test.",
