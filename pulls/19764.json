    "body": "This PR improves the robustness of our boost package in depends, most notably:\r\n1. Bumps boost from `1.70.0` to `1.71.0`, because `1.71.0`:\r\n\t1. Removes the need to patch out the unused variable.\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f8462a6d2794be728cf8550f45d19a354aae59cf/depends/packages/boost.mk#L36\r\n\t\tUpstream boost patched it out in https://github.com/boostorg/process/commit/d20b64cf37a773e452b84ce619752e3785be756c, which was first included in the `1.71.0` release\r\n\t2. Comes packaged with a version of `b2` which allows us to override its `CXX` and `CXXFLAGS`. Previously, choosing a toolset while building `b2` such as `clang` or `gcc` would force `b2`'s build system to invoke the compiler as a bare, hardcoded `clang` or `gcc`. However, our `depends` build system often want to customize this behaviour, adding extra flags or invoking the compiler by an alternate name. So this is useful.\r\n\t\t1. Commit where `CXX` was introduced: https://github.com/boostorg/build/commit/374f96516a6210687cdf63c987710501634bcac9\r\n\t\t2. Commit where `CXXFLAGS` was introduced: https://github.com/boostorg/build/commit/5d49abc1f291573d4bdcd2ee647b05a66f9c6497\r\n2. The boost package is now split into `native_b2` and `boost`, better representing what actually happens.\r\n\t- In our `depends` build system, we have a distinction between `native` packages and non-`native` packages. The output of `native` packages are meant to be used on the machine that's performing the build, and the output of non-`native` packages are meant to be used on/for the machine that will ultimately be running bitcoin. Previously, `boost` existed in `depends` as a non-`native` package, but that's partly inaccurate because the `./bootstrap.sh` invocation in its `$(package)_config_cmds` stage actually produced a binary called `b2`, which is run on the machine that's performing the build. This means that `b2` is a `native` package which is being built in an environment set up for the non-`native` package `boost`. This reveals a hidden unintended behavior in our `depends` build system: for linux->darwin cross builds, we use `gcc` for `native` packages, and `clang` for non-`native` packages. But `b2` was actually being built using `clang`, since it was being built in an environment set up for non-`native` packages.\r\n\r\ntheuni you might be interested in taking a look",

Not only that, but using sed isn't necessarily robust and it can fail silently. Most of our usage is also missing any documentation explaining why something is being done, when it should be updated/removed etc.\r\n\r\nRather than relying on sed going forward, where possible, I've converted our sed usage into patches. These are easier to maintain, contain documentation, and should fail loudly when they don't apply.\r\n\r\nThe remaining sed usage, (1 in miniupnpc, the rest in qt), are non-trivial to remove, as they are using build-time variables, or some input from the environment.\r\n\r\nThis also steals 2 related commits out of #19716.\r\n\r\nRelated to #16838.",

          "title": "Replace boost::filesystem with std::filesystem",
          "body": "## Introduction\r\n\r\nC++17 has introduced the filesystem library. [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem) describes very well the origin of the library:\r\n\r\n> The filesystem library was originally developed as boost.filesystem, was published as the technical specification ISO/IEC TS 18822:2015, and finally merged to ISO C++ as of C++17. The boost implementation is currently available on more compilers and platforms than the C++17 library.\r\n\r\nThis draft PR was created to gain feedback and examine what would be necessary to switch from `boost::filesystem` to `std::filesystem` in bitcoin codebase.\r\n\r\nBitcoin codebase contains `src/fs.h` which is a wrapper for the [currently used filesystem library](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6762a627ecb89ba8d4ed81a049a5d802e6dd75c2/src/fs.h#L18). The first impression is that one may just replace `namespace fs = boost::filesystem;` with `namespace fs = std::filesystem;` and all will be good. Unfortunately, there are some differences between the [Boost's filesystem library](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/filesystem/doc/reference.html) and the [c++17 filesystem library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem). A nice summary by Davis Herring can be read [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40899267/how-similar-are-boost-filesystem-and-the-c-standard-filesystem-library).\r\n\r\n## Differences between filesystem implementations that affects Bitcoin code\r\n\r\n1. `boost::filesystem::system_complete()` was renamed to `std::filesystem::absolute()` \\[[source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46271698)\\]\r\n\r\n2. [boost::filesystem::absolute()](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/filesystem/doc/reference.html#absolute) has second `const path& base` parameter which was dropped in [std::filesystem::absolute](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/absolute) (see [reasoning](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0492r2.html#US78)).\r\n\r\n     Each such instance like [this one](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/blockchain.cpp#L2284) can be fixed by changing:\r\n\r\n     `fs::path path = fs::absolute(request.params[0].get_str(), GetDataDir());`\r\n\r\n     to\r\n\r\n    `fs::path path = fs::absolute(GetDataDir() / request.params[0].get_str());` where `/` is function call of `operator/` function.\r\n\r\n     Note: Notably `path(\"foo\") / \"c:/bar\"` yields `c:/bar`. However, that's how `boost::filesystem::absolute(p, base_dir)` behaves too.\r\n\r\n3. [boost::filesystem::path::imbue()](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/filesystem/doc/reference.html#path-imbue) is not present in `std::filesystem::path`.\r\n\r\n4. [boost::filesystem::unique_path()](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/filesystem/doc/reference.html#unique_path) is not present in `std::filesystem`.\r\n\r\n5.

I was looking at this and didn't dig into all the details of all the changes, but did think they all look safe and sane and were well motivated.\r\n\r\nI guess most ideally the boost build system would accept different build and host toolchains in its configuration, and use the right tools for the right things, so everything could be built in one package. But I guess its bootstrap script isn't really written to work this way, so the separate native b2 package makes sense and is a reasonable way to get the right compiler used.",

So setting `build_CXX=clang` should work.\r\n\r\nAs for the case of just setting `$(package)_toolset_$(host_os)=clang`, `$(package)_toolset_$(host_os)` strictly depends on `$(package)_cxx`, so changing that by itself won't influence `$(package)_cxx`. Since it's a strict dependency, we should probably remove this variable at some point in the future and replace it with a simple `$(if $(findstring clang,$($(package)_cxx)),clang,gcc)` to avoid confusion.",
