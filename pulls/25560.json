I also had to \"fill in\" a little bit of procedure on things I couldn't find reference for, but very open to feedback if I've missed the mark somehow in those areas.\r\n\r\nI've tried largely to keep it informal, with \"shoulds\" and \"mays\" aplently, but over time we might change these to be required behaviors/procedures.",

      "body": "> @Xekyo Conceptually, I think there can be minor fixups to the existing docs to clarify some stuff that was discussed in the IRC meeting that motivated this pull requests.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a general desire from numerous contributors and maintainers including Marco above to reduce the scope of the changes in this PR and instead just to complete minor fixups. There are various reasons for this but they include not wanting to impose greater maintenance burden (i.e. requiring regular changes to this doc as things change e.g. maintainer focus) and not wanting to tie maintainers up in processes that not only take extra time but also potentially make things worse  than the status quo (a maintainer needing to auto merge another maintainer's PRs to get round a restriction that a maintainer can't merge their own PR no matter how much review it has).\r\n\r\nI strongly believe that when there are controversies or differences of viewpoint that there should be open discussion (e.g. on IRC) and maintainers should be expected to engage with that discussion (i.e. if they merge something that informed contributors don't think should have been merged or merge something prematurely without sufficient review). But I don't believe in tying them up in counterproductive processes and trying to catch them out because they didn't follow a long list of processes imposed by this doc.\r\n\r\nHence I'm a Concept ACK on minor fixups as Marco says but if the PR author disagrees and thinks more expansive changes are required I'm an Approach NACK on that. I don't want to speak on behalf of others but that seems to be the general sentiment from most other contributors' comments too.\r\n\r\nI also don't want to engage in a flame fight on this so I won't be commenting on this PR again. Just wanted to pop up and say my 2 cents as I'm not sure this is heading in a productive direction.\r\n\r\n",

Not only between maintainers (to avoid merges not meeting the usual review bar) but also in the eyes of the contributors to know whom should be the default interlocutor in case of questions on such or such subsystem. As already echoed, I also believe it would be great to have any consensus change to have a review/merge process of its own (where maybe the merge could be counter-signed by a N-of-M of the maintainers).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524#issuecomment-1176897581\r\n\r\n",

I didn't think that a lint error was the blocking/bottleneck for a documentation change which still needed more buy-in before merge, but perhaps you think the document is closer to ready for merge than I appreciated.

WIP isn't an issue of \"confidence\", it's an issue of process, and it's not certain to me by what process a document would be approved or by who. E.g., is this something to get a quorum of some sort of contributors to weigh in on? All of the current maintainers? Since I began this document, we've added 1 contributor and removed 2, so clearly it's a moving target. Perhaps, as the maintainer engaging on this PR, you could shed light on what you think the \"merge criteria\" are on this, and I'd be happy to appropriately remove WIP. In terms of confidence I think that #25839 is mergeable (although should get some review to check it) as per @instagibbs feedback that the bits that are nor purely descriptive ought to be debated, that version is more or less descriptive (I think).",

          "body": "As per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25560, I suggested that new maintainers should be added with a call for maintainer process as outlined below.\r\n\r\n> \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)  by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\r\n if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\r\n role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\r\n maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\r\n relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\r\n\r\nThe doc has not been adopted. However, bitcoin is a permissionless project, so I am opening a C4M that is just of my own personal initiative.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Do we need a new scoped maintainer?\r\n\r\nFrom IRC on August 12th, 2022, where @laanwj also stepped down:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<bytes1440000> I see a need for \"janitorial maintainer\" who understands the importance of privacy in core and privacy of contributors. Since #25560 is still open and intent of reviewers doesn't look they want to improve anything in the process, there is no \"call for maintainers\" thing.\r\n<bytes1440000> I would prefer someone who has already contributed to bitcoin privacy and privacy in general, not living in first world countries and not funded by brink.\r\n<vasild> #proposedmeetingtopic vasild for a new maintainer with a focus on P2P/networking \r\n<vasild> I volunteer, if there is a perceived need for that.\r\n<bytes1440000> vasild: thanks for volunteering and i think you are the best candidate for p2p/privacy. I wish we had one for mempool/privacy and wallet/privacy as well.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Today's IRC Meeting, August 18th 2022. For the sake of the new process, please consider that ACKs here are ACKs on the person but are included here as demonstrating ACKs on the need for such a new maintainer & the role. Note also that vasild is not explicitly stating privacy, as bytes1440000 requested initially, which has been clarified below in this discussion to be out-of-scope for this proposed maintainer. (Please see the complete logs for all discussion, this is not a full excerpy).\r\n\r\n```\r\n<vasild_> Two maintainers stepped down recently (sipa and laanwj) and there is no dedicated maintainer for P2P/networking. So I step in coz I think I can help the project in that way. That's it.\r\n<laanwj> i think it would make some sense, you've been the most active in P2P development for quite a while\r\n<jarolrod> concept ack, i think vasild_ is very qualified for such a role. And has contributed important changes to the p2p code. He also has done extensive reviews, and catching issues others don't catch\r\n<michaelfolkson> +1\r\n<hebasto> concept ack\r\n<achow101> ack\r\n<lightlike> ack vasild\r\n<jonatack> a thought: the past few years vasild, laanwj, and myself have been working on or reviewing a large-ish chunk of net code that few others have been. i believe sipa knows the code well, too, along with (maybe) a couple others. laanwj has been merging these changes. so it makes sense to me that one of these would maintain.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Relevant Evamples of PRs such a maintainer might focus on\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25421\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25717\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25688\r\n\r\nwhich includes things that impact privacy in P2P\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19860\r\n\r\nBut does not include non P2P/Networking Privacy code like:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23372\r\n\r\n## Nominees\r\n\r\nI will keep this synced with nominees from the below thread / other maintainers feel free to edit to keep synchronized.  Feel free to self nominate. As per #25560, nomination period + Q&A is \"open\" for 2 weeks, after which a decision may be made if desired.\r\n\r\nCurrent Nominees:\r\n\r\n- @vasild (nomination accepted, self)\r\n- @jonatack (nomination acceptance pending)",

          "body": "Same as https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-December/021293.html\n\r\nList of present bitcoin core maintainers:\r\n\r\n|   Username    |    Focus Area   |\r\n| ------------- | -------------   |\r\n|  MarcoFalke   | General, QA     | \r\n|  fanquake     | General, Build  |\r\n|  hebasto      | General, UI/UX  |\r\n|  achow101     | General, Wallet |\r\n|  glozow       | General, Mempool|\r\n\r\nLast 2 developers that stepped down as bitcoin core maintainer:\r\n\r\n|   Username    | \r\n| ------------- | \r\n|     sipa      | \r\n|     laanwj    | \r\n\r\nProcess followed in adding last maintainer:\r\n\r\n1) fanquake [nominated][0] glowzow as rbf/mempool/validation maintainer. \r\n2) It was discussed in an IRC [meeting][1] and most of the developers agreed to add her as new maintainer except mild NACK from Jeremy Rubin. Some contributors did not like different opinions being shared in the meeting.\r\n3) A [pull request][2] was opened by glowzow to add keys. There were several ACKs, 2 NACKs and 1 meta concept NACK.\r\n   My NACK: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524#issuecomment-1172518409\r\n   NACK by jamesob: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524#issuecomment-1172570635\r\n   Meta concept NACK by luke-jr: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524#issuecomment-1175625779\r\n\r\n   Eventually everyone agreed to add glowzow as maintainer and improve the process of adding maintainers. Pull request was merged by MarcoFalke.\r\n\r\nInitiatives to improve the process and documentation:\r\n\r\n1) Jeremy opened a [pull request][3] and there were lot of disagreements with the documentation. It was closed since a related PR with less changes could be easy to agree upon. \r\n2) Related [pull request][4] with minimal documentation was also closed by Jeremy with a comment that desire to improve docs seems to be missing based on reviews.\r\n3) Jeremy opened an [issue][5] with title 'Call for Maintainer: P2P & Networking + Privacy' which was changed later and 'Privacy' was removed. He nominated jonatack and vasild was already self nominated so mentioned in the pull request. Nobody appreciated this effort to nominate self or others for a new maintainer. Later this was closed.\r\n4) I had opened an [issue][6] with title Call for Maintainer: Privacy'. This even involved privacy of contributors and not just bitcoin core. It received some comments that made no sense and I eventually closed the issue. \r\n\r\nProcess being followed for adding vasild as maintainer:\r\n\r\n1) vasild volunteered to be a new maintainer on [IRC][7]\r\n2) It was discussed in IRC [meeting][8], some developers ACKed it and there were no issues.\r\n3) A [pull request][9] was opened by vasild to add keys which is still open and its been 4 months. There were already some ACKs from the IRC meeting and pull request also received some ACKs (16 until now). fanquake, dergoegge and JeremyRubin had some disagreements. Jeremy had recently withdrawn all ACK/NACK from bitcoin core repository for some reasons, fanquake has not replied yet and dergoegge had some new disagreements although don't mind if the pull request is merged.\r\n4) Earlier disagreements were related to scoping and it was changed by vasild\r\n4) There was even a comment that disrespected vasild's contributions in bitcoin core and we had to literally share pull requests in which vasild has improved bitcoin core.\r\n5) I tried adding the topic for a bitcoin core dev weekly meeting but did not achieve anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation for Bitcoin and used by 90% nodes, what should be the ideal process or changes you would expect in roles, procedures etc.?\r\n\r\n- 'Call for maintainers' issue should be opened if contributors or maintainers need a new maintainer.\r\n- Discussion about nominated contributors in an IRC meeting where everyone is allowed to share their opinion.\r\n- One of the nominated contributor that gets most ACKs could open pull request to add keys. Everyone can ACK/NACK this PR with reasons.\r\n- Maintainers should be unbiased in merging these pull requests.\r\n- New maintainer should not be funded by the organization that already does it for most of the maintainers.\r\n- Long term contributors that are not living in a first world country should be encouraged.\r\n- Either we should agree every maintainer is a general maintainer that can merge pull request from different modules or define scope for present and new maintainers. We can't do both.\r\n- Self merging pull requests should be avoided.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any thoughts that could improve this process and involve less politics. \r\n   \r\n\r\n[0]: https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-06-28#826651\r\n[1]: https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-06-30#827695\r\n[2]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524\r\n[3]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25560\r\n[4]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25839\r\n[5]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25870\r\n[6]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25875\r\n[7]: https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-08-12#842847;\r\n[8]: https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-08-18#844523\r\n[9]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25871\r\n",

This\n+process is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but as an excerpt:\n+\n+> Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+> maintainers.\n+>\n+> Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+> principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will\n+> judge the general consensus of contributors.\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected",

For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors.

Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions.

Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1.

However, the role does include permissions on the\n+repository, and connotes a general sense of stewardship over the project.\n+\n+\n+Largely, the role of maintainers is to decide to merge Pull Requests. This\n+process is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but as an excerpt:\n+\n+> Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+> maintainers.\n+>\n+> Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+> principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will\n+> judge the general consensus of contributors.\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1. Longer term focuses beyond the next release\n+\n+Maintainers are generally free to structure their posts as they like. Posts are\n+not expected to be \"all new content\", they can be simple updates from the last\n+post. Posts may also be more frequent, if there is significant updates to share.\n+\n+Historical examples of similar postings:\n+\n+- [@laanwj](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html)\n+- [@achow101](https://achow101.com/2020/10/0.21-wallets)\n+\n+\n+Below, each maintainer should keep up-to-date links of current and past\n+prioritization addresses (as well as any other useful materials in that\n+respect).\n+\n+#### @achow101\n+#### @fanquake\n+#### @hebasto\n+#### @laanwj\n+#### @marcofalke\n+#### @sipa\n+\n+Non maintainers may also share similar documents detailing their work here:",

However, the role does include permissions on the\n+repository, and connotes a general sense of stewardship over the project.\n+\n+\n+Largely, the role of maintainers is to decide to merge Pull Requests. This\n+process is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but as an excerpt:\n+\n+> Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+> maintainers.\n+>\n+> Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+> principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will\n+> judge the general consensus of contributors.\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion.

For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion.

As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1. Longer term focuses beyond the next release",

For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions.

However, the role does include permissions on the\n+repository, and connotes a general sense of stewardship over the project.\n+\n+\n+Largely, the role of maintainers is to decide to merge Pull Requests. This\n+process is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but as an excerpt:\n+\n+> Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+> maintainers.\n+>\n+> Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+> principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will\n+> judge the general consensus of contributors.\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1. Longer term focuses beyond the next release\n+\n+Maintainers are generally free to structure their posts as they like. Posts are\n+not expected to be \"all new content\", they can be simple updates from the last\n+post. Posts may also be more frequent, if there is significant updates to share.\n+\n+Historical examples of similar postings:\n+\n+- [@laanwj](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html)\n+- [@achow101](https://achow101.com/2020/10/0.21-wallets)\n+\n+\n+Below, each maintainer should keep up-to-date links of current and past\n+prioritization addresses (as well as any other useful materials in that\n+respect).\n+\n+#### @achow101\n+#### @fanquake\n+#### @hebasto\n+#### @laanwj\n+#### @marcofalke\n+#### @sipa\n+\n+Non maintainers may also share similar documents detailing their work here:\n+\n+\n+## Maintainers \"Moving On\"\n+\n+Maintainers may choose to cease being a maintainer at any time without notice.\n+Where possible, maintainers should try to gracefully transition out of their\n+role, until a new maintainer has been selected to replace them (if needed).\n+\n+## Maintainer Removal",

Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1.

However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1. Longer term focuses beyond the next release\n+\n+Maintainers are generally free to structure their posts as they like. Posts are\n+not expected to be \"all new content\", they can be simple updates from the last\n+post. Posts may also be more frequent, if there is significant updates to share.\n+\n+Historical examples of similar postings:\n+\n+- [@laanwj](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html)\n+- [@achow101](https://achow101.com/2020/10/0.21-wallets)\n+\n+\n+Below, each maintainer should keep up-to-date links of current and past\n+prioritization addresses (as well as any other useful materials in that\n+respect).\n+\n+#### @achow101\n+#### @fanquake\n+#### @hebasto\n+#### @laanwj\n+#### @marcofalke\n+#### @sipa\n+\n+Non maintainers may also share similar documents detailing their work here:\n+\n+\n+## Maintainers \"Moving On\"\n+\n+Maintainers may choose to cease being a maintainer at any time without notice.\n+Where possible, maintainers should try to gracefully transition out of their\n+role, until a new maintainer has been selected to replace them (if needed).\n+\n+## Maintainer Removal\n+\n+\n+Maintainers should be removed by other maintainers if there is any reason to\n+believe the maintainer or their keys may be compromised -- this removal can be\n+done temporarily by any single maintainer, unless there are only three\n+remaining maintainers (in which case removal requires 2, a majority), but\n+should be unanimously decided if permanent removal. While imperfect, this\n+procedure ensures that access can be revoked quickly in the event of a\n+compromise, while preventing takeover by a single dev.",

As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion.

As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1.

If Alice and Bob are maintainers, and self merges are not allowed, Alice informs Bob that they think the PR is ready to be merged. This induces a bias in Bob which has the same problems as the bias of Alice merging her own PR, but perhaps less strongly. It is likely that Bob trusts Alice's judgejent as she is a maintainer. However it is possible to be completely opaque to observers that there was bias because the communication from Alice to Bob may not be in a place that is public or publicly logged. With a self merge, it is at least completely evident that there is some bias.\r\n\r\nThis also exists with regular contributors who post \"ready for merge\".\r\n\r\nI think it is more preferable to keep things as transparent as possible rather than to reduce bias here. Review can be done after merges, and transparency allows such reviewers to keep any potential bias in mind.",

However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions. Candidates are also\n+encouraged to write up a Prioritization statement (see below) in conjunction\n+with the key PR.\n+\n+At the discretion of the maintainers, and no sooner than 2 weeks after the PR\n+is opened, the candidate(s) PR may be merged.\n+\n+\n+## Maintainer Prioritizations\n+\n+While the maintainers are ultimately not accountable to any particular roadmap,\n+nor can make regular contributors focus on one area or another, practically the\n+views and prioritizations of maintainers have an impact on what gets reviewed,\n+merged, and the general direction of the project.\n+\n+As such, maintainers should regularly deliver a written \"state of the union\"\n+article on what they intend to focus on in the coming period. Such addresses\n+should be done per-release cycle, and should minimally cover:\n+\n+1. What went well in the last release cycle\n+1. What is making good progress for this release cycle\n+1. How the maintainer intends to prioritize outstanding\n+   PRs/issues/features/projects in the next release cycle\n+1. Projects which could use participation from other contributors\n+1.

For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer.

Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected\n+candidate should create a PR for adding their key to the repository and to the\n+above table (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23798 for example).\n+During / Before the PR, regular contributors are encouraged to correspond with\n+candidate(s) publicly about any concerns or questions.
