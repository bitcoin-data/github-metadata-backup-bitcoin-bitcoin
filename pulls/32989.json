    "body": "This changeset migrates all current self-hosted CI jobs over to hosted [Cirrus Runners](https://cirrus-runners.app/).\r\n\r\nThese runners cost a flat rate of $150/month, and we qualify for an open source discount of 50%. Therefore they are $75/month/runner.\r\n\r\nOne \"runner\" should more accurately be thought of in terms of the number of vCPU you are purchasing: https://cirrus-runners.app/pricing/ or in terms of \"concurrency\", where 1 runners gets you 1.0 concurrency.\r\ne.g. a Linux x86 Runner gets you 16 vCPU (1.0 concurrency) and 64GB RAM to be provisioned as you choose, amongst one or more jobs.\r\n\r\nCirrus Runners currently only support Linux (x86 and Arm64) and MacOS (Arm64).\r\nThis changeset does **not** move the existing Github Actions native MacOS runners away from being run on Github's infrastructure. This could be a follow up optimisation.\r\n\r\nRuns from this changeset using Cirrus Runners can be found at: https://github.com/testing-cirrus-runners/bitcoin2/actions which shows an uncached run on master ([CI#1](https://github.com/testing-cirrus-runners/bitcoin2/actions/runs/16298637161)), an outside pull request ([CI#3](https://github.com/testing-cirrus-runners/bitcoin2/actions/runs/16303305483?pr=1)) and an updated push to master ([CI#4](https://github.com/testing-cirrus-runners/bitcoin2/actions/runs/16304182527)).\r\n\r\nThese workflows were run on 10 runners, and we would recommend purchasing a similar number for our CI in this repo to achieve the speed and concurrency we expect.\r\n\r\nWe include some optional performance commits, but these could be split out and made into followups or dropped entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n### Maintenance\r\n\r\nAs we are not self-hosting, nobody needs to maintain servers, disks etc.\r\n\r\n### Bus factor\r\n\r\nCurrently we have a very small number of people with the know-how working on server setup and maintenance. This setup fixes that so that \"anyone\" familiar with GitHub-style CI systems can work on it.\r\n\r\n### Scaling\r\n\r\nThese do _not_ \"auto-scale\"/have \"unlimited concurrency\" like some solutions, but if we want more workers/cpu to increase parallism or increase the runner size of certain jobs for a speed-up we can simply buy more concurrency using the web interface.\r\n\r\n### Speed\r\n\r\nRuntimes aproximate current runtimes pretty well, with some jobs being faster.\r\nCaching improvements on pull request (re-runs) are left as future optimisations from the current changeset (see below).\r\n\r\n### GitHub workflow syntax\r\n\r\nWith a migration to the more-commonly-used GitHub workflow syntax, migration to other providers in the future is often as simple as a one-line change (and installing a new GitHub app to the repo).\r\n\r\nIf we decide to self-host again, then we can also self-host GitHub runners (using https://github.com/actions/runner) and maintain new GH-style CI syntax.\r\n\r\n### Reporting\r\n\r\nGitHub workflows provide nicer built-in reporting directly on the \"Checks\" page of a pr. This includes more-detailed action reporting, and a host of pretty nice integrated features, such as [Workflow Commands](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/workflow-commands-for-github-actions) for creating annotations that can print messages during runs. See for example at the bottom of this window where we report `ccache` hitrate, if it was below 90%: https://github.com/testing-cirrus-runners/bitcoin/actions/runs/16163449125?pr=1\r\n\r\nThese could be added conditionally into our CI scripts to report interesting or other information.\r\n\r\n## Costs\r\n\r\n### Financial\r\n\r\nRelative to competitors Cirrus runners are cheap for the hosted CI-world. However these are likely more expensive than our current setup, or a well-configured (new) self-hosted setup.\r\n\r\nIf we started with 10 runners to be shared amongst all migrated jobs, this would total $750/mo = $9000/yr.\r\n\r\nNote that we are not trying to comptete here on cost directly.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nWe would be dependent on Cirrus infra.\r\n\r\n## Forks\r\n\r\n- Forks should be able to run CI without paid Cirrus runners. This behaviour is achieved through a rather verbose `runs-on:` directive.\r\n  - This directive hardcodes the main repo (unfortunately you cannot use the `env` github context in this field in particular, for some reason).\r\n  - This directive also allows for a fork to patch the `runs-on:` field in the ci.yml file if they want to use Cirrus Runners too.\r\n  - The workflow otherwise will fallback to the GitHub free runners on forks.\r\n- This cirrus cache action transparently falls back to github actions cache when not running on cirrus, so forks will get some free github caching (10GB per repo).\r\n\r\nAll jobs work on forks, but will run (slowly) on GitHub native free hosted runners, instead of Cirrus runners. They will also suffer from poor cache hit-rates, but there's nothing that can be done about that, and the situtation is an improvement on today.\r\n\r\n## Migration process\r\n\r\nThe main org should also, in addition to pulling code changes:\r\n\r\n1. Permit the actions `docker/setup-buildx-action@v3` and `docker/login-action@v3` to be run in this repo.\r\n\r\n## Caching\r\n\r\nFor the number of CI jobs we have, cache usage on GitHub would be an issue as GH only provides 10GB of cache space, **per repo**. However cirrus provides [10 GB per runner](https://cirrus-runners.app/setup/#speeding-up-the-cache), which scales better with the number of runners.\r\n\r\nThe `cirruslabs/action/[restore|save]` action we use here redirects this to Cirrus' own cache and is both faster and larger.\r\n\r\nIn the case that user is running CI on a fork, the cirrus cache falls back transparently to GitHub default cache without error.\r\n\r\n### ccache, depends-sources, built-depends\r\n\r\n- Cached as blobs via `cirruslabs/actions/cache` action.\r\n- Current implementation:\r\n  - On `push`: restores and saves caches.\r\n  - On `pull_request`: restores but does **not** save caches.\r\n\r\nThis means a new pull request should hit a _pretty relevant_ cache.\r\nOld pull requests **which are not being rebased on master** may suffer from lower cache hit-rate.\r\n\r\nIf we save caches on all pull request runs we run the risk of evicting recent (and more relevant) cache blobs.\r\nIt may be possible in a future optimisation to widen this to save on pull request runs too, but it will also depend on how many runners we provision and what cache churn rates are like in the main repo.\r\n\r\n### Docker build layer caching\r\n\r\n- Cached using the `gha` cache backend\r\n- These cache blobs compete for space with `ccache`, `depends-sources` and `depends-built` caches\r\n- `gha` cache allows `--cache-from` to be used from pull requests, which does not work using a registry cache type (technically we could use a public read-only token to get this working, but that feels wrong)\r\n\r\nThis backend does network i/o and so are marginally slower than our current disk i/o cache.\r\n\r\n## But what about... `x`?\r\n\r\nWe have tested many other providers, including [Runs-on](https://runs-on.com/), [Buildjet](https://buildjet.com/), [WarpBuild](https://www.warpbuild.com/), and GitHub hosted runners (and investigated even more). But they all fall short in one-way or another.\r\n\r\n- Runs-On and Buildjet (and others) require installing GH apps with much too-liberal permissions (e.g. `Administration: Read|Write`) for our use-case.\r\n- GitHub hosted runners suffer from all of high costs, lower speed, small cache, and the requirement for a GitHub Teams subscription.\r\n- WarpBuild seems to be simply too expensive.\r\n\r\n## TODO:\r\n\r\nTo complete migration from self-hosted to hosted for this repo, the backport branches `27.x`, `28.x` and `29.x` would also need their CI ported, but these are left for followups to this change (and pending review/changes here first).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWork and experimentation undertaken with @m3dwards ",

As you say, we can set the ccache to save on pull requests too (in the future) if necessary.\r\n\r\n> > Give the robot account read/write access to this repo\r\n> \r\n> This seems a bit scary.

My assumption was that the tokens would be added to CI in this repo and CI had write access to the registry, not the other way round. Why would the registry need write access here?\r\n\r\nSorry for not being clearer! The robot account gets read/write access to the Quay.io (docker) repo, not this code repository! \r\n\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Edit: We may reconsider #31850 and drop container image caching, and just accept the intermittent network IO errors or network speed issues.\r\n\r\nYes, I would love to get #31850 working in any case, as it would simply avoid long rebuilds in the worst cases; most docker images are rebuilding in < 2 minutes, except MSAN...\r\n",

I think this is equally true for all cloud providers though.\r\n\r\nIt's my belief that if we complete this migration we are resonably well protected against this risk for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. As we use the common GitHub workflow yaml format, changing to another provider can be as simple as amending the `runs-on: ` line in the yaml (and installing a different provider's GH app, and changing the `cache` action to that provider's own).\r\n2. We could always revert back to a self-hosted solution utilizing the new workflow yaml via https://github.com/actions/runner, which for example can be trivially configured on one or more self-hosted servers using [services.github.runner](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=25.05&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=github+runner) with Nix (I have a demo of such a configuration [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/nix-github-runner)).\r\n\r\nWe seem to have a good working relationship so far with Cirrus, @m3dwards has a responsive and helpful contact there. Of course, we are in the tendering stage so there is perhaps extra impetus to be helpful to us, but I don't see any reason that a historical precedence of limiting free runners (which are allegedly being abused for crypto mining), should appear any more risky to paid/premium customers (than any other provider).",

If we want to switch back to the self-hosted runners, it should be as trivial as `git revert $the_merge_commit_of_this_pull`. Alternatively, switch to GHA-based self-hosted runners. Though, it would be good to create a proof-of-concept pull request to switch to self-hosted runners in GHA, or a different hosted alternative (e.g. warp-build), after this pull is merged. This makes it easier to see that (1) it works and (2) how easily it is possible.",

      "body": "Thanks for the review on this so far.\r\n\r\nWhilst we had tested the docker registry caching on PRs successfully, because I was opening them myself (and was owner of the parent repo) repo-level variables were available to me which were *not* available to 3rd party pull requests.\r\n\r\nThe short of this is that this meant the docker registry cache setup could _not_ pull from the registry on pull requests and we didn't think it was therefore suitable for our purposes.\r\n\r\nWe have switched to the `gha` cache backend in the latest force-push with the good news that we finally have it working for all images correctly; caching to/from on pushes, and caching from on pulls.\r\n\r\nA push to master can be found here: https://github.com/testing-cirrus-runners/bitcoin2/actions/runs/16529929752\r\n\r\nAnd a pull request (from a 3rd party account) here: https://github.com/testing-cirrus-runners/bitcoin2/actions/runs/16531270443?pr=3\r\n\r\nA new commit has been added, 0bd758e6c54, to fix a (new?) issue we experienced with the asan job where the runner host appeared to update it's image and kernel. The cached docker image for the ASAN job then had the incorrect `linux-headers-<version>` package installed, causing the job to fail. There are likely multiple ways to fix this (we could input `uname` as a docker build arg for example), but simply forcing a reinstall of the correct headers in `03_*.sh` seemed easiest. Open to suggestions here however...\r\n\r\nMarking as ready for review now, as I think this is conceptually ready.\r\n",

      "body": "I pushed a commit to make a cache save on pull requests, and then a force push dropping that commit. This worked, but I do see some unexpected ccache hit rates... not sure if anyone here might have an idea about it; I'm at a bit of loss about what could be going wrong here to be honest.\r\n\r\nIn e.g. the `previous releases` job, the cache was saved here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/16589926678/job/46922852038?pr=32989#step:9:77\r\n\r\n> Sent 426321843 of 426321843 (100.0%), 81.3 MBs/sec\r\n> Cache saved with key: ccache-ci_native_previous_releases-16589926678\r\n\r\nThis is the correct size for this cache; the CI run build ended with:\r\n\r\n>  Primary storage:\r\n>   Hits:               0 / 1494 (0.00 %)\r\n>   Misses:          1494\r\n>   Cache size (GB): 0.43 / 0.50 (86.19 %)\r\n>   Cleanups:          20\r\n\r\nWe then in the next run, where I only dropped the temporary cache-save commit, restored this exact cache: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/16595726917/job/46941763412?pr=32989#step:4:49 (note that we don't hit on primary key, but hit on a fallback, final line, which matches exactly the cache save above):\r\n\r\n> Cache hit for: ccache-ci_native_previous_releases-16595726917\r\n> Cache Size: ~407 MB (426321843 B)\r\n> Cache restored successfully\r\n> Cache restored from key: ccache-ci_native_previous_releases-16589926678\r\n\r\nIn fact we know this is the correct cache as this is currently the *only* cache that has ever been saved for this job. The problem is that later on in this re-run our ccache hit-rate was a meagre 19%: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/16595726917/job/46941763412?pr=32989#step:8:2986\r\n\r\n>  ccache version 4.5.1\r\n> Summary:\r\n>   Hits:             148 /  747 (19.81 %)\r\n>     Direct:          54 /  747 (7.23 %)\r\n>     Preprocessed:    94 /  693 (13.56 %)\r\n>   Misses:           599\r\n>     Direct:         693\r\n>     Preprocessed:   599\r\n> Primary storage:\r\n>   Hits:             360 / 1624 (22.17 %)\r\n>   Misses:          1264\r\n>   Cache size (GB): 0.43 / 0.50 (85.79 %)\r\n>   Cleanups:          64\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what is causing the misses here; I would expect this to be 100% (or 99.x%) which I have seen previously.\r\n",

Previously we used actions/cache blobs for ccache. This works ~ ok, but Cirrus restores partial matches in reverse-age order (oldest first), which was resulting in bad cache hitrates for ccache when multiple caches existed for a job (say, \"old\" and \"new\"). The HTTP ccache backend is used on Cirrus infra and shared between all jobs. This requires using docker `-host` networking as we are using ccache inside the container. Visible (all misses on first run) [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/16778178769/job/47509375518?pr=32989#step:8:2862) in logs\r\n- Set TEST_RUNNER_PORT_MIN in d57b291736 to avoid conflicting with the above remote ccache host\r\n- Reduced ccache hitrate warning level to 75% in 0e768d18bd",

Currently it defaults to `11000` which seems to not conflict with anything currently:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n❯ rg TEST_RUNNER_PORT_MIN\r\ntest/functional/test_framework/util.py\r\n354:PORT_MIN = int(os.getenv('TEST_RUNNER_PORT_MIN', default=11000))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a reason you'd prefer to have this added back in; just to be more explicit?\r\n\r\n> [c18b093](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/c18b0939da00d5851e6adcedbba5100ad791b486) also seems fine to keep, but can be cherry-picked in a follow-up.\r\n\r\nDespite this gaining quite some decent-enough runtime performance, I'd prefer to add this in a followup after having gotten TSAN failures twice in this PR.\r\n\r\n@fanquake also noted that he saw some issues when using `(2 * nproc)` in local runs, so I think safer to leave for now.\r\n",

I think this is confusing and so I agree to remove this var. Forks would have to patch if they want to run on cirrus runners.\r\n\r\nWhere I think I disagree is on removing the repository name check as then pushes to forks will not run on github's infrastructure which I think is a really nice to have. The more that people's personal forks run CI the less strain it will put on the main repo or on Cirrus runners. I know when I work on things it's nice to see CI running on my fork before creating a PR.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why the GUI repo should be running bitcoin/bitcoin CI, shouldn't it have it's own GUI related CI? But regardless, by keeping the repo name check the GUI repo will be able to run CI but just slower on github's runners.",

They are available to `on: pull_request_target` wofklows, but we don't want to go down that route...\r\n\r\nSadly, I can't even think of a nice-enough hack around this without doing something like:\r\n\r\n1. Create a preliminary workflow which will determine whether to use cirrus runners or not based on an `env` var. \r\n2. Change our main workflow type to be `on: workflow_call:`, where it can then be called from the preliminary workflow, passing with it the information using `inputs` on whether or not to use cirrus runners.\r\n\r\nI hope you agree with me such spaghettic is not worth it.\r\n\r\nI think I can minimise the usage of the hardcoding to a single file (`ci.yml`) though so that a patch is easy to make and maintain...",

It can be configured with\n-# multiple users to run tasks in parallel. No sudo permission is required.\n-#\n-# https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/persistent-workers/\n-#\n-# Generally, a persistent worker must run Ubuntu 23.04+ or Debian 12+.\n-#\n-# The following specific types should exist, with the following requirements:\n-# - small: For an x86_64 machine, with at least 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of memory.\n-# - medium: For an x86_64 machine, with at least 4 vCPUs and 16 GB of memory.\n-# - arm64: For an aarch64 machine, with at least 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of memory.\n-#\n-# CI jobs for the latter configuration can be run on x86_64 hardware\n-# by installing qemu-user-static, which works out of the box with\n-# podman or docker. Background: https://stackoverflow.com/a/72890225/313633\n-#\n-# The above machine types are matched to each task by their label. Refer to the\n-# Cirrus CI docs for more details.\n-#\n-# When a contributor maintains a fork of the repo, any pull request they make\n-# to their own fork, or to the main repository, will trigger two CI runs:\n-# one for the branch push and one for the pull request.\n-# This can be avoided by setting SKIP_BRANCH_PUSH=true as a custom env variable\n-# in Cirrus repository settings, accessible from\n-# https://cirrus-ci.com/github/my-organization/my-repository\n-#\n-# On machines that are persisted between CI jobs, RESTART_CI_DOCKER_BEFORE_RUN=1\n-# ensures that previous containers and artifacts are cleared before each run.\n-# This requires installing Podman instead of Docker.\n-#\n-# Futhermore:\n-# - podman-docker-4.1+ is required due to the bugfix in 4.1\n-#   (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21652#issuecomment-1657098200)\n-# - The ./ci/ dependencies (with cirrus-cli) should be installed. One-liner example\n-#   for a single user setup with sudo permission:\n-#\n-#   ```\n-#   apt update && apt install git screen python3 bash podman-docker uidmap slirp4netns curl -y && curl -L -o cirrus \"https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-cli/releases/latest/download/cirrus-linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture)\" && mv cirrus /usr/local/bin/cirrus && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cirrus\n-#   ```\n-#\n-# - There are no strict requirements on the hardware. Having fewer CPU threads\n-#   than recommended merely causes the CI script to run slower.\n-#   To avoid rare and intermittent OOM due to short memory usage spikes,\n-#   it is recommended to add (and persist) swap:\n-#\n-#   ```\n-#   fallocate -l 16G /swapfile_ci && chmod 600 /swapfile_ci && mkswap /swapfile_ci && swapon /swapfile_ci && ( echo '/swapfile_ci none swap sw 0 0' | tee -a /etc/fstab )\n-#   ```\n-#\n-# - To register the persistent worker, open a `screen` session and run:\n-#\n-#   ```\n-#   RESTART_CI_DOCKER_BEFORE_RUN=1 screen cirrus worker run --labels type=todo_fill_in_type --token todo_fill_in_token\n-#   ```\n-\n-# https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/tips-and-tricks/#sharing-configuration-between-tasks\n-filter_template: &FILTER_TEMPLATE\n-  # Allow forks to specify SKIP_BRANCH_PUSH=true and skip CI runs when a branch is pushed,\n-  # but still run CI when a PR is created.\n-  # https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#conditional-task-execution\n-  skip: $SKIP_BRANCH_PUSH == \"true\" && $CIRRUS_PR == \"\"\n-  stateful: false  # https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#stateful-tasks\n-\n-base_template: &BASE_TEMPLATE\n-  << : *FILTER_TEMPLATE\n-  merge_base_script:\n-    # Require git (used in fingerprint_script).\n-    - git --version || ( apt-get update && apt-get install -y git )\n-    - if [ \"$CIRRUS_PR\" = \"\" ]; then exit 0; fi\n-    - git fetch --depth=1 $CIRRUS_REPO_CLONE_URL \"pull/${CIRRUS_PR}/merge\"\n-    - git checkout FETCH_HEAD  # Use merged changes to detect silent merge conflicts\n-                               # Also, the merge commit is used to lint COMMIT_RANGE=\"HEAD~..HEAD\"\n-\n-main_template: &MAIN_TEMPLATE\n-  timeout_in: 120m  # https://cirrus-ci.org/faq/#instance-timed-out\n-  ci_script:\n-    - ./ci/test_run_all.sh\n-\n-global_task_template: &GLOBAL_TASK_TEMPLATE\n-  << : *BASE_TEMPLATE\n-  << : *MAIN_TEMPLATE\n-\n-compute_credits_template: &CREDITS_TEMPLATE\n-  # https://cirrus-ci.org/pricing/#compute-credits\n-  # Only use credits for pull requests to the main repo\n-  use_compute_credits: $CIRRUS_REPO_FULL_NAME == 'bitcoin/bitcoin' && $CIRRUS_PR != \"\"\n-\n-task:\n-  name: 'lint'\n-  << : *BASE_TEMPLATE\n-  container:\n-    dockerfile: ci/lint_imagefile\n-    cpu: 1\n-    memory: 1G\n-  # For faster CI feedback, immediately schedule the linters\n-  << : *CREDITS_TEMPLATE\n-  unshallow_script:\n-    - git fetch --unshallow --no-tags\n-  lint_script:\n-    - ./ci/lint_run.sh",

So two questions, could this be job.id / matrix.id instead and if not is this the right name?",
