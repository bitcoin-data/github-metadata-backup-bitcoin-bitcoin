In this document we'll\n-describe how to use it with AFL and libFuzzer.\n-\n-## Preparing fuzzing\n-\n-The fuzzer needs some inputs to work on, but the inputs or seeds can be used\n-interchangeably between libFuzzer and AFL.\n-\n-Extract the example seeds (or other starting inputs) into the inputs\n-directory before starting fuzzing.\n-\n-```\n-git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets\n-export DIR_FUZZ_IN=$PWD/qa-assets/fuzz_seed_corpus\n-```\n-\n-AFL needs an input directory with examples, and an output directory where it\n-will place examples that it found. These can be anywhere in the file system,\n-we'll define environment variables to make it easy to reference them.\n-\n-So, only for AFL you need to configure the outputs path:\n-\n-```\n-mkdir outputs\n-export AFLOUT=$PWD/outputs\n-```\n-\n-libFuzzer will use the input directory as output directory.\n-\n-## AFL\n-\n-### Building AFL\n-\n-It is recommended to always use the latest version of afl:\n-```\n-wget http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/releases/afl-latest.tgz\n-tar -zxvf afl-latest.tgz\n-cd afl-<version>\n-make\n-export AFLPATH=$PWD\n-```\n-\n-For macOS you may need to ignore x86 compilation checks when running `make`:\n-`AFL_NO_X86=1 make`.\n-\n-### Instrumentation\n-\n-To build Bitcoin Core using AFL instrumentation (this assumes that the\n-`AFLPATH` was set as above):\n-```\n-./configure --disable-shared --enable-tests --enable-fuzz CC=${AFLPATH}/afl-gcc CXX=${AFLPATH}/afl-g++\n-export AFL_HARDEN=1\n-make\n-```\n-\n-If you are using clang you will need to substitute `afl-gcc` with `afl-clang`\n-and `afl-g++` with `afl-clang++`, so the first line above becomes:\n-```\n-./configure --disable-shared --enable-tests --enable-fuzz CC=${AFLPATH}/afl-clang CXX=${AFLPATH}/afl-clang++\n-```\n-\n-We disable ccache because we don't want to pollute the ccache with instrumented\n-objects, and similarly don't want to use non-instrumented cached objects linked\n-in.\n-\n-The fuzzing can be sped up significantly (~200x) by using `afl-clang-fast` and\n-`afl-clang-fast++` in place of `afl-gcc` and `afl-g++` when compiling. When\n-compiling using `afl-clang-fast`/`afl-clang-fast++` the resulting\n-binary will be instrumented in such a way that the AFL\n-features \"persistent mode\" and \"deferred forkserver\" can be used. See\n-https://github.com/google/AFL/tree/master/llvm_mode for details.\n-\n-### Fuzzing\n-\n-To start the actual fuzzing use:\n-\n-```\n-export FUZZ_TARGET=bech32  # Pick a fuzz_target\n-mkdir ${AFLOUT}/${FUZZ_TARGET}\n-$AFLPATH/afl-fuzz -i ${DIR_FUZZ_IN}/${FUZZ_TARGET} -o ${AFLOUT}/${FUZZ_TARGET} -m52 -- src/test/fuzz/${FUZZ_TARGET}\n-```\n-\n-You may have to change a few kernel parameters to test optimally - `afl-fuzz`\n-will print an error and suggestion if so.\n-\n-On macOS you may need to set `AFL_NO_FORKSRV=1` to get the target to run.\n-```\n-export FUZZ_TARGET=bech32  # Pick a fuzz_target\n-mkdir ${AFLOUT}/${FUZZ_TARGET}\n-AFL_NO_FORKSRV=1 $AFLPATH/afl-fuzz -i ${DIR_FUZZ_IN}/${FUZZ_TARGET} -o ${AFLOUT}/${FUZZ_TARGET} -m52 -- src/test/fuzz/${FUZZ_TARGET}\n-```\n-\n-## libFuzzer\n-\n-A recent version of `clang`, the address/undefined sanitizers (ASan/UBSan) and\n-libFuzzer is needed (all found in the `compiler-rt` runtime libraries package).\n-\n-To build all fuzz targets with libFuzzer, run\n-\n-```\n-./configure --enable-fuzz --with-sanitizers=fuzzer,address,undefined CC=clang CXX=clang++\n-make\n-```\n-\n-See https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#running on how to run the libFuzzer\n-instrumented executable.\n-\n-Alternatively, you can run the script through the fuzzing test harness (only\n-libFuzzer supported so far). You need to pass it the inputs directory and\n-the specific test target you want to run.\n-\n-```\n-./test/fuzz/test_runner.py ${DIR_FUZZ_IN} bech32\n-```\n-\n-### macOS hints for libFuzzer\n-\n-The default clang/llvm version supplied by Apple on macOS does not include\n+# Fuzzing Bitcoin Core using libFuzzer\n+\n+## Quickstart guide\n+\n+To quickly get started fuzzing Bitcoin Core using [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html):\n+\n+```sh\n+$ git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\n+$ cd bitcoin/\n+$ ./autogen.sh\n+$ CC=clang CXX=clang++ ./configure --enable-fuzz --with-sanitizers=address,fuzzer,undefined\n+# macOS users: If you have problem with this step then make sure to read \"macOS hints for\n+# libFuzzer\" on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md#macos-hints-for-libfuzzer\n+$ make\n+$ src/test/fuzz/process_message\n+# abort fuzzing using ctrl-c\n+```\n+\n+## Fuzzing harnesses, fuzzing output and fuzzing corpora\n+\n+[`process_message`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/fuzz/process_message.cpp) is a fuzzing harness for the [`ProcessMessage(...)` function (`net_processing`)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net_processing.cpp).
