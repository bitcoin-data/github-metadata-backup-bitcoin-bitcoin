    "body": "This is included in #5582, but I'm PRing separately because it is a badly needed fix. It also needs backport to 0.10. Unfortunately, this will force all dependencies to be rebuilt. I'll accept lashings as penance...\n\nWill rebase #5882 after merge.\n\nBroken hash logic caused all depends on some platforms (osx at least) to end up with the same build-id. Without this fix, nothing will be rebuilt when recipes or dependencies change. The 'cut' was put in the wrong place, so rather than hashing the hashes, it hashed the filename which was always \"-\" (stdin). Probably a stupid c/p mistake. \n",

          "body": "tl;dr: Update to a newer stable toolchain and SDK for OSX without giving up\nany backwards compatibility. We can move to clang 3.5 as a next step which\nallows use to use libc++ and the 10.10 sdk, but we'll need to find a build that\nworks in gitian/travis first.\n\nSwitch to a new, better maintained fork of cctools:\nhttps://github.com/tpoechtrager/cctools-port\n\nI've forked this and will be working on it some as well:\nhttps://github.com/theuni/cctools-port\n\nThis brings in:\ncctools v862\nld64: v241.9\n\nIt also fixes 64bit builds, so there's no longer any need to use a 32bit clang.\nSince clang is no longer tied to an old/crusty 32bit build, clang has been\nupgraded to 3.3. Unfortunately, there's a bug in 3.4 that breaks builds. 3.5\nworks fine, but there are no binary builds compatible with precise, which is\ncurrently used for gitian and travis. We could always build our own if\nnecessary.\n\nAfter updating to stable clang/linker/cctools, it's possible to use a more\nrecent SDK. The current SDK (10.7) through the most recent 10.10 have all been\nbuilt/tested successfully, both with and without 10.6 compatibility. However,\n10.10 requires clang 3.5.\n\nSDKs >= 10.9 use libc++ rather than libstdc++. This is verified working as well.\n\nSorry for the thought-dump, there are lots of pieces here. Despite that, this should be a pretty smooth upgrade. The messier parts (bumping the minimum runtime requirement, switching build SDKs, switching to libc++, rolling our own clang, etc) are left for later. All of those things have been tested and work fine, they just need to be discussed first.\n",
