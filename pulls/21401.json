    "body": "Currently versionbits deployments are stored in a simple C array in `Params`. Setting the actual values needs to be done externally. Since the memory is allocated and initialized when `Params` is initialized, it is possible to have a deployment with uninitialized (or otherwise garbage and invalid) values set for its parameters if something is forgotten when they are being set.\r\n\r\nInstead of this two step approach (create deployment object, then set its members), I think it is better to have a constructor where those parameters are passed in and set when the deployment is initialized. This PR does that. In order for this to work though, `vDeployments` cannot be a simple C array. It is instead changed to be a `std::map<DeploymentPos, VBitsDeployment>`. This maps the deployment enum to the `VBitsDeployment` object itself; this is essentially how we were using `vDeployments` previously. Additionally, by also changing `VersionBitsDeploymentInfo` to a map as well, we are able to remove `MAX_VERSION_BITS_DEPLOYMENT` and all of the places where we were iterating the deployments no longer need to cast an int to `DeploymentPos`.\r\n\r\nAn additional concern is that the members of `VBitsDeployment` are not const and could thus be accidentally changed during runtime. To prevent this, this PR makes all members of `VBitsDeployment` const.\r\n\r\nLastly, to make `VBitsDeployment` actually fully describe a deployment, this PR moves the number of blocks in a period into the struct. In order to ensure that this variable matches up with the retarget period, a unit test is added.\r\n\r\nBuilt on top of #21392 and #21380 for the refactors and other changes they make to `VBitsDeployment`.",

Ah, a different approach that might be worth considering:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nclass CChainParams\r\n{\r\nprotected:\r\n    CChainParams(const Consensus::Params& cons) : consensus{cons} { } // or std::move, whatever\r\npublic:\r\n    const Consensus::Params consensus;\r\n    ...\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass CRegTestParams : public CChainParams\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    CRegTestParams(const ArgsManager& args) : CChainParams{getConsensus(args)}\r\n    { ... }\r\n    \r\n    static Consensus::Params getConsensus(const ArgsManager& args)\r\n    {\r\n        Consensus::Params consensus{};\r\n        consensus.foo = bar; ...\r\n        // parse -segwitheight and -vbparams here as well\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nand have default initializers for everything in `Consensus::Params`?\r\n\r\nNot keen on the map -- the possibility that `deployments.at(DEPLOYMENT_FOO)` might throw doesn't seem that great to me; and if you're just using `deployments[DEPLOYMENT_FOO]` and relying on it getting default initialised to something sane, might as well give VBitsDeployment a default initiaizer and just use the array?",

I don't really like the idea of consensus params being initialized with default values that might not actually be what is wanted.",

It also does not need most of Consensus::Params,\nso pull out the two relevant fields directly.\n\nAlso pull the Condition() implementation and Mask() function into the\nbase class, though keeping Condition() virtual to allow it to be replaced.\n\nThis simplifies the API substantially, but more importantly makes it\neasier to test independently.",
