    "body": "Currently versionbits deployments are stored in a simple C array in `Params`. Setting the actual values needs to be done externally. Since the memory is allocated and initialized when `Params` is initialized, it is possible to have a deployment with uninitialized (or otherwise garbage and invalid) values set for its parameters if something is forgotten when they are being set.\r\n\r\nInstead of this two step approach (create deployment object, then set its members), I think it is better to have a constructor where those parameters are passed in and set when the deployment is initialized. This PR does that. In order for this to work though, `vDeployments` cannot be a simple C array. It is instead changed to be a `std::map<DeploymentPos, VBitsDeployment>`. This maps the deployment enum to the `VBitsDeployment` object itself; this is essentially how we were using `vDeployments` previously. Additionally, by also changing `VersionBitsDeploymentInfo` to a map as well, we are able to remove `MAX_VERSION_BITS_DEPLOYMENT` and all of the places where we were iterating the deployments no longer need to cast an int to `DeploymentPos`.\r\n\r\nAn additional concern is that the members of `VBitsDeployment` are not const and could thus be accidentally changed during runtime. To prevent this, this PR makes all members of `VBitsDeployment` const.\r\n\r\nLastly, to make `VBitsDeployment` actually fully describe a deployment, this PR moves the number of blocks in a period into the struct. In order to ensure that this variable matches up with the retarget period, a unit test is added.\r\n\r\nBuilt on top of #21392 and #21380 for the refactors and other changes they make to `VBitsDeployment`.",

Ah, a different approach that might be worth considering:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nclass CChainParams\r\n{\r\nprotected:\r\n    CChainParams(const Consensus::Params& cons) : consensus{cons} { } // or std::move, whatever\r\npublic:\r\n    const Consensus::Params consensus;\r\n    ...\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass CRegTestParams : public CChainParams\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    CRegTestParams(const ArgsManager& args) : CChainParams{getConsensus(args)}\r\n    { ... }\r\n    \r\n    static Consensus::Params getConsensus(const ArgsManager& args)\r\n    {\r\n        Consensus::Params consensus{};\r\n        consensus.foo = bar; ...\r\n        // parse -segwitheight and -vbparams here as well\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nand have default initializers for everything in `Consensus::Params`?\r\n\r\nNot keen on the map -- the possibility that `deployments.at(DEPLOYMENT_FOO)` might throw doesn't seem that great to me; and if you're just using `deployments[DEPLOYMENT_FOO]` and relying on it getting default initialised to something sane, might as well give VBitsDeployment a default initiaizer and just use the array?",

I don't really like the idea of consensus params being initialized with default values that might not actually be what is wanted.",

The mainnet parameters were discussed on the mailing list, the testnet ones were made up in the process of writing this PR because no one discussed testnet activation parameters.\r\n\r\nFor regtest, I chose to mirror the number of retarget periods that mainnet would experience, just on the regtest threshold and retarget period.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a small test for activating on regtest.\r\n\r\nRequires #21392",

This bundle may _apparently_ introduce usage of `g_chainman` or `::Chain(state|)Active()` globals, but these are resolved later on in the overall PR. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n2. There may be seemingly obvious local references to `ChainstateManager` or other validation objects which are not being used in callers of the current function in question, this is done intentionally to **_keep each commit centered around one function/method_** to ease review and to make the overall change systematic. We don't assume anything about our callers. Rest assured that once we are considering that particular caller in later commits, we will use the obvious local references. [Commits of overall PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20158/commits)\r\n3. When changing a function/method that has many callers (e.g. `LookupBlockIndex` with 55 callers), it is sometimes easier (and less error-prone) to use a scripted-diff. When doing so, there will be 3 commits in sequence so that every commit compiles like so:\r\n\t1. Add `new_function`, make `old_function` a wrapper of `new_function`, divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the local module only**\r\n\t2. Scripted-diff to divert all calls to `old_function` to `new_function` **in the rest of the codebase**\r\n\t3. Remove `old_function`",

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #10102 + #19460.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`5f91aa3d8b47` multiprocess: Add bitcoin-gui -ipcconnect option](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19461/commits/5f91aa3d8b47cee97e625c3b5689a37dbd941eff)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBuilding on #10102, this adds an `-ipcconnect` option to `bitcoin-gui` that connects the GUI to an existing `bitcoin-node` process already running in the background instead of spawning a new `bitcoin-node` process. This allows the GUI to be started and stopped independently of the node. By default with this change, `bitcoin-gui` will check if a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` socket exists and try to connect to that. If that doesn't work, it will spawn a new node process and start up the same way it did before this PR.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-gui` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which tries to connect if possible as described above, and spawns a new `bitcoin-node` process if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to never connect to an existing node and always spawn a new one, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, basic functionality works and gui instances can connect and disconnect from a running node. But there are rough edges: If a gui process doesn't shut down cleanly, the node can see unhandled IpcExceptions, and if node command line options are passed to `bitcoin-gui` and `bitcoin-gui` connects to an exiting bitcoin-node process instead of spawning a new one, the node options will be silently ignored. \r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)",

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This is based on #10102.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`bbefbd3c199b` multiprocess: Add -ipcconnect and -ipcbind options](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19460/commits/bbefbd3c199b189188d6427b4564b17477c6d50e)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBuilding on #10102, this adds an `-ipcconnect` option to `bitcoin-wallet` and an `-ipcbind` option to `bitcoin-node` (both enabled by default in multiprocess builds) so bitcoin node will listen on a `<datadir>/sockets/node.sock` unix socket, and `bitcoin-wallet` will connect to it.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that `bitcoin-wallet` can be extended in the future to have some online functionality. For example, there could be a `bitcoin-wallet sync` command that will update balances and sync latest transactions to an unloaded wallet, or a `bitcoin-wallet serve` subcommand that loads a wallet and serves RPC requests, or a `bitcoin-wallet shell` subcommand that allows running RPC methods interactively like the GUI console, or just general support for `bitcoin-wallet <rpc method> <rpc params>` invocations suggested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13926#issuecomment-455187379.\r\n\r\nThis PR is small and doesn't do much. The only visible change is that `bitcoin-wallet` now checks whether a node socket exists on startup and prints \"Connected to IPC address\" if it can connect it it.\r\n\r\nThe default `bitcoin-wallet` connect option is `-ipcconnect=auto`, which connects if possible as described above, and proceeds offline if not possible. Other supported options are `-noipcconnect` to disable ipc, `-ipcconnect` to require a connection and fail if it can't be established, and `-ipcconnect=unix:<socket>` to require a connection and use a custom socket path.\r\n\r\nThese changes require multiprocess support and this PR has no effect unless bitcoin is configured with `--enable-multiprocess` as described in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)\r\n",

It also moves moves versionbitscache into deploymentstatus to avoid a circular dependency with validation.",

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an `--enable-multiprocess` configure option which builds new `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables with relevant functionality isolated into different processes. See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n",

Then the minimum activation height parameter is introduced. This also adds the minimum activation height as a third parameter of `-vbparams`. Additionally, the threshold is made a parameter of each deployment so that it can be customized for each deployment. Lastly several unit and functional tests are added.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this easier to backport, the names of functions and classes are largely unchanged (except where necessary for the height based things). This means that some things are misnamed as they refer to BIP 9 even though this is really BIP 8.\r\n\r\nThis PR borrows 2 commits from #19573 to implement height based versionbits, one commit from #21377 for tests, and 1 commit formerly part of #21380 for the threshold parameterization.",

It also does not need most of Consensus::Params,\nso pull out the two relevant fields directly.\n\nAlso pull the Condition() implementation and Mask() function into the\nbase class, though keeping Condition() virtual to allow it to be replaced.\n\nThis simplifies the API substantially, but more importantly makes it\neasier to test independently.",

This PR is largely the non-refactor portions of #19573.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the lockinontimeout parameter is made configurable through a `-vblot` command line option as has been suggested by many people. Note that no attempt is made to have lockinontimeout=true or lockinontimeout=false nodes try to find peers with the same policy. However nodes that set `-vblot` will have a user agent comment indicating this.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #21392 for the change to height based version bits, and #21399 for the renames.",

It is just supposed to enforce internal consistency and prevent bugs by ensuring that list arguments are always retrieved with GetArgs() and non-list arguments are always retrieved with GetArg(). Followup PRs could use the ALLOW_LIST flags for better documentation and error checking in the future. For example, #17493 builds on this to disallow conflicting config values. \r\n\r\nThis change was originally made as part of #17493",
