    "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. See the original branch for the evolution of the spec.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\n## What to test and review? \r\n\r\n- [ ] #29295 \r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n- [ ] Make nested pull-requests easier: #29274\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\nI'll make separate pull requests for parts that are ready for detailed review. Probably starting with ECDH and the Noise Protocol.\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nSilent Payments also needs the ECDH module, so I cherry-picked the commit from #28122. It uses ECDH is a slightly different way, but perhaps there's more overlap to be had.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Upstream issues\r\n\r\n### Spec\r\n\r\n- [ ] modify spec to use `ProvideMissingTransactions`? (followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Noise\r\n\r\n- [ ] use EllSwift https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66, implemented in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/28\r\n- [ ] certificate signing issue: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/717, fix in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/29\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [x] persist static key (needs #29229)\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [x] create `Sv2Transport` subclass similar to `V2Transport`: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/27\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n- [ ] adjust base58 encoding of authority public key https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/721\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [x] hold on to templates a bit after a block is found https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/709 (in case of race to prevent downstream crashes, though we still wouldn't relay it without additional changes)\r\n- [ ] hold on to template transactions even if the mempool drops them (for some time)\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

      "body": "Rebased and big refactor.\r\n\r\nIntroducing `Sv2Transport`, a subclass of `Transport` very similar to `V2Transport`. For the most part this abstraction works quite well, and should make it easy to review for people familiar with the v2 transport (BIP324) implementation.\r\n\r\nThere'a few pain points though, perhaps @sipa has thoughts on this?\r\n\r\n1. `CNetMessage` and `Sv2NetMsg` can perhaps be united to a single base class, but there are differences: `Sv2NetMsg` does not need `std::string m_type`. This is why I ended up not implementing the override for `GetReceivedMessage()`\r\n\r\n2. Similar to (1), `SetMessageToSend` expects `CSerializedNetMsg`, but we need to keep track of the the header separately (because it contains the message length). So I implemented `SetMessageToSend(Sv2NetMsg& msg)` instead.\r\n\r\n3. (very minor): the `m_type` part of `GetBytesToSend` is not needed\r\n\r\n4. `Sv2TemplateProvider::ThreadSv2Handler()` contains some copy-pasted stuff from `CConnman::SocketSendData`. Ideally I'd like to extract some common functionality from `CConnman` that deals with sockets (and maybe also memory use checking, though I think that's less of an issue for sv2).\r\n\r\nAnother implementation thing to consider, though I think that can wait until I start splitting this into separate PR's, is that I'm trying to organise the code in such a way that putting the sv2 Template Provider in a separate process will be relatively straightforward to do as a followup. One of the goals of the sv2 project is for template providers to run as a public service. Multiple changes to this PR are needed to do that safely, but one thing that should help is (eventually) moving it out of the node process, so that worst case only the TP crashes.\r\n\r\nIn particular I've been moving stuff so that `Sv2Transport` has no dependency on `Node`, by moving `Transport`, `CSerializedNetMsg` and `CNetMessage` out of `net.cpp`. `Sv2TemplateProvider` does, but very little (mostly `miner.h`). \r\n\r\nBiggest changes:\r\n* ceef59cbb029a36bbb9cb3414e8a4c2d4dcf0652 -> 77987c6292171151e574017079b1644dca0d2efd\r\n* 0764c5531a1d1b4020b97a22bf4449cf32365f37 -> 61cfd61e1472e9bc7019f6c637259ac6ad5821ef\r\n* 2f7e02d45473e69d5dd8634d9f30e2d5875f7f2f",
