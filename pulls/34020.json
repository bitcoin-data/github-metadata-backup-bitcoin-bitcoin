    "body": "Based on:\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/242\r\n\r\nFor Stratum v2 custom job declaration to be bandwidth efficient, the pool can request[^0] only the transactions that it doesn't know about.\r\n\r\nThe spec doesn't specify how this is achieved, but one method is to call the `getrawtransaction` RPC on each transaction id listed in [DeclareMiningJob](https://stratumprotocol.org/specification/06-Job-Declaration-Protocol?query=DeclareMiningJob#644-declareminingjob-client-server) (or a subset if the pool software maintains a cache). Using RPC is inefficient, made worse by the need to make multiple calls. It also doesn't support queuing by witness id (yet, see #34013).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two new IPC methods:\r\n\r\n- `getTransactionsById()`: takes a list of `Txid`'s\r\n- `getTransactionsByWitnessID()`: : takes a list of `Wtxid`'s\r\n\r\nBoth return a list of serialised transactions. An empty element is returned for transactions that were not found.\r\n\r\nThe `Txid` variant, just like its RPC counterpart, takes advantage of `-txindex` if enabled. The `Wtxid` variant can't do that unless we add a `-witnesstxindex`, but at least sv2 has no use for that.\r\n\r\nThe RPC additionally allows providing a `block_hash` hint. I haven't implemented that here because I don't have a need for it. It can always be added later.\r\n\r\nI thought about having a single (or overloaded) `getTransactions()` that works with both `Txid` and `Wtxid`, but I prefer that clients are intentional about which one they want.\r\n\r\nA unit and functional test cover the new functionality.\r\n\r\nSv2 probably only needs `getTransactionsByWitnessID()`, but it's easy enough to just add both.\r\n\r\n\r\n[^0]: there's two reasons the pool requests these transactions: to approve the template and to broadcast the block if a solution is found (the miner will also broadcast via their template provider).

For example with `std::optional<std::string>` or `std::string*` we would want to interpret empty `Data` fields as empty strings not null values. Even for serializable types it's not really safe to treat empty `Data` the same as null since empty `Data` could be a valid serialization for some objects. For CTransaction objects though it is safe.\r\n\r\nAnother annoying thing is that if the goal is to be able to serialize `vector<CTransactionRef>` as `List(Data)` and allow the vector to contain null values, the most obvious way to do it would be to map null `CTransactionRef` values to null data values. But annoyingly although the Cap'n Proto wire format can represent null Data values in a list and has APIs to set null Data values and has APIs to distinguish between null and empty Data values in non-list contexts, it doesn't currently provide any way to distinguish between null and empty Data values when the Data value is in a List.\r\n\r\nSo your workaround of interpreting empty Data values as null CTransactionRef is probably the best approach for now. I put together an implementation that should be more robust in b14778374b0694f7255f774cb657c7049cb4256e ([tag](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/nohasfield.1)). It limits the workaround to `CTransactionRef` data fields only and avoids making any assumptions in `type-pointer.h` about the type of pointers. It also includes a unit test that makes sure null values can be passed correctly.",

Although it interprets the empty fields as `b''` rather than `None`, that shouldn't be an issue for client developers. This is captured by your note:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n//! [*] The Cap'n Proto wire format actually does distinguish between null and\r\n//! empty Data values inside Lists, and the C++ API does allow distinguishing\r\n//! between null and empty Data values in other contexts, just not the List\r\n//! context, so this limitation could be removed in the future.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is fixed one day and we correctly encode null on the wire, it would technically be a breaking API change, but trivial to deal with for clients. E.g. the functional test would check for both `b''` and `None`.\r\n\r\nb14778374b0694f7255f774cb657c7049cb4256e looks good to me, can you make a libmultiprocess PR, and another PR here that bumps the subtree to use it and add the tests? I'll rebase on that.",
