    "body": "This updates the libsecp256k1 subtree to upstream master, and switches ECDSA validation to it.\n\nPractical upshot:\n- Signature validation is anywhere between 2.5 and 5.5 times faster.\n- Consensus code no longer depends on OpenSSL or its signature parser.\n- Removes linking with OpenSSL from libconsensus.\n\nLibsecp256k1 itself has not had a stable release, but we're very close to that. This PR is effectively a preview, with the intention of switching to the released version before the Bitcoin Core 0.12 release.\n\nThe past months libsecp256k1 has undergone very extensive testing and validation, though some of that work is still under review. This includes:\n- Very high branch coverage (which required generating a trillion random test vectors and strip them down to the 32 which collectively give the highest coverage for the scalar arithmetic code)\n- Formal proofs for the group laws using SAGE, and human-verifiable proof annotations for the field arithmetic logic.\n- Test code that generates random valid DER signatures, fuzzes them, and compares the result of parsing them internally and using OpenSSL - which turned up a set of (to me) previously unknown behaviour in OpenSSL's parser.\n- The ability to compile in a test mode which switches to a slightly different curve (one constant change), resulting in a group of only 139 points instead of around 2<sup>256</sup>, allowing exhaustive testing of nearly all code.\n\nThe above things are planned to be finished before final release, as well as some API changes - though probably none that affect Bitcoin's usage.\n\nThanks to everyone who contributed so far (including but not limited to @gmaxwell, @apoelstra, @peterdettman, @theuni, @luke-jr, ...).\n",

In each row, the relevant PR has been added to all the previous PR's, so the last row is the cumulative effect of all of them.\nPlease see notes below.\n\n| PR | ConnectBlock time (ms) | Reduction in time from this PR | CreateNewBlock time (ms) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| baseline | 500 - 1500 |  |  |\n| #6954(secp256k1) | 400 - 600 | 15%-65% |  |\n| #6931(skip BIP30) #6932(modifyNewCoins) | 200 - 350 | 30%-40% | 3000 - 3500 |\n| #6357(dynamic Priority) #6898(CreateNewBlock) | 200 - 350 | very small increase | 180 - 230 |\n| #6936(warm cache) | 150 - 200 | 10%-30% | 130 - 170 |\n| #6918(faster sigcache) #6914(prevector) | 130 - 150 | 20%-30% | 100 - 120 |\n\nThese numbers should be taken to be rough estimates.  They were collected from a series of different tests.  I reran different binaries over a historical simulation of all the p2p traffic for the month of October.  I also ran live binaries running the various PRs for the first 8 days of November.  I ran versions both with and without periodically calling CreateNewBlock to time it.  All of these PR's interact with each other significantly.  So running them in different combinations or with different arguments may lead to significantly different results.  I used the following settings:\n- maxmempool=300\n- dbcache=1000\n- minrelaytxfee=0.0001\n- maxsigcachesize=1000000  (or 80 for binaries including #6918)\n",

The openssl dependency then would only be required when building the QT only BIP70 implementation.\n",

As I understand it, he is comfortable with pulling this part in before the rest of fortuna.\n\nThe bulk of changes here are tests, the actual changes are small. Tests verify that encryption/decryption/keygen work as expected, but also that the results match openssl's exactly (including output buffers in failure cases).\n\nThe aes-cbc decryption attempts to be done in constant-time, in case it's re-used in the future in places that may be susceptible to timing attacks. It works with/without padding, so it could be re-used in different contexts.\n\n@sipa I copied your structures for AES_Decrypt/AES_Encrypt for the sake of simplicity, so there's a good bit of duplication here now. I'm happy to re-work with templates, merged classes, separate files, etc.\n\nBesides the unit tests, I've also done some quick sanity checks via rpc to verify that switching back and forth between implementations works as expected. Wallets encrypted with openssl still decrypt fine, and likewise the other way around.\n",

New algorithms are being proposed towards some of the most fundamental aspects of bitcoin - signature validation. As we all know, things can go terribly wrong in this space and unfortunately it is not even knowable what can go wrong. \n\nCertain experts have expressed concerns about seemingly impossible claims that 700% improvements can be achieved by these \"invented\" mathematical algorithms. Further concerns have been raised towards suggestions that this is more tested than standard practice when standard practice requires some 20 years of testing.\n\nI am not, of course, suggesting that the proposed changes are conceptually deficient, but I would not be comfortable with these changes in the absence of proper documentation and wider review from experts who specialise in this area because it is far too easy to hide backdoors in this space or less maliciously to unknowably fatally weaken the algorithm and its security. \n",

The review of libsecp256k1 (which included comparison of results with the current consensus-protocol OpenSSL verification) turned up serious consensus-failure bugs in OpenSSL which BIP 66 solved. When review of the new code has fixed de facto problems in the old code, I think it demonstrates a clear higher standard of testing for the new code. \"20 years of testing\" is non-existent insofar as consensus safety is concerned - the field of decentralised consensus systems is only 6 years old, after all.\n",

None of the consensus rules are intended\nto change.\n\nI do agree that better visibility of the algorithms used is useful.\n\nOne thing that is planned before final release is an explanation of the\ntest procedures and formal verification mechanisms used.\n\nA small summary of the optimizations used in signature verification, and are not used by OpenSSL:\n- A special representation for field elements (numbers modulo 2^256 - 2^32\n- 933), using 5 52-bit limbs (rather than the typical 4 64-bit limbs),\n  inspired by an Ed25519 implementation. This allows performing multiple\n  additions and constant multiplications in a row without carry or\n  normalization.\n- Multiplication algorithm for field elements that computes the\n  intermediate high 256 bits in parallel with the low 256 bits (by Peter\n  Dettman).\n- x86_64 assembly implementation for scalar and field multiplications\n  (disabled in Bitcoin's build).\n- Inversion-free comparison for ECDSA verification (by Greg Maxwell).\n- Fast inversion and square root ladders (by Peter Dettman).\n- Very large table of precomputed multiples of the secp256k1 curve\n  generator point (~1 megabyte), resulting in very low overhead for computing\n  aP + bG compared to just aP.\n- Effective affine EC multiplication, which allows using affine group\n  addition formulae with a single correction at the end for all additions\n  (possible due to secp256k1 having a=0 in the group equation, by Peter\n  Dettman).\n- Bypassing the exensive point-in-group check needed by ECDSA, as for\n  secp256k1 every point on the curve belongs to the group (it has cofactor 1).\n- No heap memory overhead anywhere during tight loops, as all memory is\n  allocated on the stack, preconputed, or constant.\n- No indirect calls or function pointers, as libsecp256k1 only supports one\n  curve, so no dispatch/lookups for implementations are needed.\n\nFor all of the above, we have:\n- High test coverage (the only missing parts are cryptographically\n  improbable to reach ones).\n- Hand verifiable proof of correctness for the field multiplication\n  algorithm (provably no overflow, and provably equivalent to the correct\n  response assuming no overflow).\n- Computer verified proof of correctness for group addition formulae\n  (computer algebra system can prove polynomial equivalence between\n  implementation and mathematical expressions for the result).\n- Special compilable mode that changes a constant to end up with a very\n  small group, and exhaustive tests that all assumptions remain true (in\n  progress, by Andrew Poelstra).\n- Test cases for the scalar code that were extracted from a set of 1\n  trillion randomly generated tests which give very high\n  coverage, and work in progress to algebraically derive cases that trigger\n  the (nearly) unreachable remaining ones.\n\nFurthermore:\n- An old build mode which used OpenSSL's bignum code for integer operations helped discover a bug in OpenSSL square code (CVE-2014-3570).\n- During tested we discovered an platform inconsistency in OpenSSL's signature parsing code (fixed by BIP66).\n- Our ECDSA signature fuzzer pointed out several types of previously unknown invalid signature types that OpenSSL accepted (discovered after BIP66 took effect).\n",

It may look weird because it doesn't appear to be used.\nBut if secp256k1_context_verify and verify_refcount were static attributes of ECCVerifyHandle, we would see much clearly which functions/methods need to take the ECCVerifyHandle as parameter.\nI suggest doing both changes.\n",
