    "body": "While reviewing #31244, I realized that the enum `DeriveType` here logically refers to the derive type for ranged descriptors. This became evident to me while going through the implementations of `IsRanged` & `IsHardened` functions of `BIP32PubkeyProvider` and the `ParsePubkeyInner` function. Initially I got confused by reading `IsRange` translating to `!= DeriveType::NO`, but later realised it specifically referred to the presence of ranged derivations. I feel explicitly calling this enum `RangedDeriveType` would make it easier to parse the descriptors code.\r\n\r\n-BEGIN VERIFY SCRIPT-\r\nsed -i 's/DeriveType/RangedDeriveType/g' src/script/descriptor.cpp\r\n-END VERIFY SCRIPT-\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.
