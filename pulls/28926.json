    "body": "This picks up #27534 with a rebase and a few fixups, now squashed. See #27534 for more background information.\r\n\r\nConsiderations from the previous draft:\r\n\r\n> Should we allow dimensions to be rearraged?\r\n> \r\n> When it comes time to gather up the RPC results, @vasild has provided an [alternate implementation](https://github.com/vasild/bitcoin/commits/getnetmsgstats) that uses an array instead of the MultiMap structure. This results in two changes:\r\n> \r\n>> using the stack over the heap (yay!)\r\n>> enforcing a strict ordering of dimensions (direction, network, connection type, message type)\r\n> \r\n> Aside from being good for memory, the reasoning here is allowing users to rearrange dimensions may be too confusing. I personally really like the ability to rearrange dimensions, which is why I have not integrated that solution into this PR, but am open to whatever the larger community prefers :) [Link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#issue-1685662150)\r\n\r\n^ I have looked at the alternative implementation (thanks @vasild!), but prefer the current version myself so long as the performance is not an issue. I've left this as-is for now. If folks here think that it might be an issue then I can investigate the alternative further. See the next consideration for additional reasoning on sticking with the current approach.\r\n\r\n> Now that an effort has been made to remove the friendship between CConnman and CNode (see this PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27257) I'm unsure if this (recording network stats on a CConnman object) belongs here. [Link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#discussion_r1179508199)\r\n\r\n^ These changes make @valid's alternative approach a bit harder to rebase and AB test with the current approach, as it relied on access to the `CNode` msg queue, and #27257 included the change: \"CNode's message processing queue is made private in the process and its mutex is turned into a non-recursive mutex.\" It can be worked around, but I'm not convinced it will be worth it.\r\n\r\n> this function should handle if index > NUM_NET_MESSAGE_TYPES [Link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#discussion_r1191793368)\r\n\r\n^ I took this suggestion as part in 800ec2ac762cb48ac667cdf04de263634404569e\r\n\r\n> https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27534#discussion_r1191798171\r\n\r\n^ I refactored this array in c909dc5704465aa96ce4496ed14452719e0b7860 to make it more comprehensible in the source code.\r\n\r\nAdditional considerations from OP:\r\n\r\n* The code organisation was mainly taken care of by @satsie, with _src/netstats.{h\\|cpp}_ now code from the netstats namespace instead of being contained within _net.cpp_\r\n",

Results may optionally be arranged by direction, network, connection type and/or message type.\r\n\r\n### Arguments\r\n\r\n**show_only**: an optional array of one or more dimensions to show as part of the results. Valid options are: direction, network, message_type, and connection_type. If no dimensions are specified, totals are returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nBelow are some examples on how the new `getnetmsgstats` RPC can be used.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n

has provided an [alternate implementation](https://github.com/vasild/bitcoin/commits/getnetmsgstats) that uses an array instead of the `MultiMap` structure. This results in two changes:\r\n\r\n- using the stack over the heap (yay!)\r\n- enforcing a strict ordering of dimensions (direction, network, connection type, message type)\r\n\r\nAside from being good for memory, the reasoning here is allowing users to rearrange dimensions may be too confusing. I personally really like the ability to rearrange dimensions, which is why I have not integrated that solution into this PR, but am open to whatever the larger community prefers :)\r\n\r\n### Locking & Consistency Beyond Individual Values\r\n\r\nWith atomics, we know we can rely on the values for individual stats like bye count and message count. However, the byte count and message count may not always match. For example, let’s say we currently have 5 messages, and 100 bytes:\r\n\r\n    1. A new 20 byte message comes in. First the byte count is incremented to 120.\r\n    2. A request to read the stats comes in. The RPC returns message count 5 and byte count 120.\r\n    3. The message count is incremented to 6 in response to the new message that came in at step 1.\r\n\r\nThe read operation did not return accurate data! Unlike the torn write example for a single value, It returned data that was true for some point in time, it’s just that the values for message count and byte count were inconsistent.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, it’s actually not enough to lock the `MsgStat` struct. It's my understanding that you need a mutex to protect the entire `NetStats` data structure.\r\n\r\nThe trade off here isn’t attractive. A lock would halt network threads that are doing important stuff, all for the sake of consistent stats. Even for reads, we would have to stop writes. We’d end up stopping threads that are doing important things for something that is not that important.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is how often will this RPC be called? If it’s once in a blue moon, then such a mutex is probably fine. But for a live dashboard that is making a call every second, this is not acceptable.\r\n\r\n### Making Enum Indices Safe and Reliable\r\n\r\n`src/net.cpp` contains a bunch of `*To/FromIndex()` methods that convert an enum to an index number. I’ve decided to be explicit about these conversions because enums are not guaranteed to start at zero and it’s not enough to simply associate the first value in an enum with a number. \r\n\r\nTo protect against potential gaps or overlaps in numbering, every single enum value must be assigned an index. This is the only way to guarantee that the numbering is safe and reliable. \r\n\r\nInstead of updating the existing `Network` and `ConnectionType` enums to assign indices to each enum value, and risk unintentionally modifying the behavior of code that uses these enums, I’ve opted for the conversion methods. This also narrows the scope of the conversion methods, making changed behavior easier to spot if the indices are modified.\r\n\r\nI’m interested in feedback on this. The `*To/FromIndex()` methods have low review and maintenance cost, but I’m unsure if I’ve correctly evaluated the risks associated with updating the `Network` and `ConnectionType` enums <can insert an example of assigning specific indices to each enum value>. Also open to discussion on if there is a better place for these conversion methods to live.\r\n",

          "body": "Implemented `getblockfileinfo` RPC command to obtain block files related data.\r\n\r\nThe new RPC could be useful for:\r\n\r\n1) Make manual pruning process more transparent: Currently, users blindly provide a height to `pruneblockchain` and only realizes up to which block the node was pruned from the RPC command result. This new introduced command lets the user know where to set the `pruneblockchain` height by knowing the highest and lowest block heights stored on each file. So users will actually be able to remove specific block ranges (with some exceptions, as blocks can be stored out of order in different block files.. but that is a different topic).\r\n\r\n2) Make tests more robust and readable by removing magic numbers like the ones presented in `rpc_getblockfrompeer.py` (which are actually off by a good degree and not really document anywhere, see [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27770#issuecomment-1567161622)).\r\n\r\n3) And also for testing AssumeUTXO. Which, per mzumzande comment: it usage could result in block files with a very mixed-up block order. So having a way to analyse this better seems like it could be helpful. Also see a live scenario in [theStack comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27770#issuecomment-1569050370).",

A possibility could be through a net permission flag, if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27114 makes it in.\"\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17167#issuecomment-1168606032 - \"This would allow us to use https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25355 when making outgoing connections to all nodes, except to whitelisted ones for which we would use our persistent I2P address.\"\r\n- Force-relay/mempool permissions for a node you intentionally connected to.\r\n",

Arguably this approach fits the unix philosophy better.\r\n\r\nI personally think it's a nice for human to be able to aggregate on the RPC in case tools like `jq` or `fx` aren't available or something, but as mentioned removing this ability would simplify one of the commits here.",

Would be nice to have that finally eventually. I meant that if it is too complex for review or causes controversy then to get the simpler one first merged (without aggregation) and then in another PR do the aggregation. Maybe that would not be necessary. I am updating the WIP from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...vasild:bitcoin:getnetmsgstats and will compare with this...",

(Included in this PR)\r\n* Ensuring pruning doesn't go too far for a desired-functional wallet backup. (Questionable, since you probably lose the node if you need the backup anyway?)\r\n* Allowing users to temporarily disable block indexes and filters, without pruning cutting them off from catching up later.\r\n* Avoiding pruning out from under external wallets (Armory, EPS, etc) that might need block data.\r\n* External block indexes/filters, etc.\r\n\r\nBy design, users retain complete control over prune locks, and can delete them out from under applications using them. This is to avoid circumstances where a prune lock has been set, by an application that may no longer be used.\r\n",

Feel free to pick them.\r\n> \r\n> Should I PR the above branch?\r\n\r\nHey Vasil, I think this makes most sense, especially seeing as you've co-authored/written most of the changes here, and your improvements on the new branch! \r\n\r\nI've been testing your branch out today and am a fan of the simplicity vs this changeset. I did kind of prefer the \"aggregation\" RPC behaviour in this branch, even though it doesn't really aggregate, more accurately it \"groups by\".\r\n\r\nIn any case, your new branch does actually aggregate results, and the same effect can be easily achieved. e.g. to produce output like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"wtxidrelay\": {\r\n    \"bytes\": 1146,\r\n    \"count\": 47\r\n  },\r\n  \"headers\": {\r\n    \"bytes\": 10846,\r\n    \"count\": 55\r\n  },\r\n  \"tx\": {\r\n    \"bytes\": 511341,\r\n    \"count\": 801\r\n  },\r\n  \"ping\": {\r\n    \"bytes\": 1786,\r\n    \"count\": 56\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this branch we would do: `.src/bitcoin-cli getnetmsgstats '[\"message_type\"]'`, whereas on your new fork (with actual aggregation) this requires the \"inverse\": `./src/bitcoin-cli getnetmsgstats '[\"direction\", \"network\", \"connection_type\"]'`.\r\n\r\nYour comments [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28926#discussion_r1415682660) did get me thinking whether we could use `mapRecvBytesPerMsgType` to return the netmsgstats, or conversely use data from `net_stats` to return stats to the `getpeerinfo` RPC and avoid counting the same message twice everywhere. But I'm not convinced that the changes that would be needed to do that would be worth it.",

IIUC the array will reference a `const char*`. The pointer addresses can only be allocated at runtime and in turn `g_all_net_message_types` will be static at runtime but not at compile time?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I see an easy way to have this be a compile time constant, if my understanding above is correct.",
