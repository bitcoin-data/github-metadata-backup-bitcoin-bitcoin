    "body": "Based on on @Fi3's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...Fi3:bitcoin:PatchTemplates which is based on @ccdle12's #27854. I rebased it and re-wrote the commit history. Compared to #28983 it introduces EllSwift in the handshake and fixes various bugs. I used that opportunity to change the branch name, which makes testing against [SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) slightly easier. There's no conceptual discussion on #28983 so it can be ignored by reviewers.\r\n\r\nSee [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md) for a brief description of Stratum v2 and the role of Bitcoin Core in that system..\r\n\r\nThere's roughly four layers:\r\n\r\n1. Noise encryption #29346\r\n2. Messages and transport layer #30315\r\n3. Sv2Connman https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/50\r\n4. The Template Provider https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/49\r\n5. Starting the Template Provider from init, and misc stuff (this PR)\r\n\r\n## What to test and review?\r\n\r\nSee the [testing guide](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md#testing-guide) for various ways to test this PR. This branch is actively used by (testnet) pools, so it should be ready for high level review.\r\n\r\nI split this PR into separate pull requests for easier review. Feedback on each of them is welcome, even if they're stacked on another one.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29346\r\n- [ ] #30315\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/50\r\n  - [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30205\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/49 \r\n- [ ] #29295\r\n\r\nEven if we abandon the approach here in favor of a sidecar (see experimental below), it is useful to review the above changes. They are fully reusable as demonstrated in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48. And until we actually ship something else, the above is being used by people, including on (very limited) mainnet.\r\n\r\nThe pull requests below enable a sidecar approach:\r\n\r\n- [ ] #30509\r\n- [ ] #30510\r\n- [ ] #30409\r\n- [ ] #30440\r\n\r\nThese are needed with any approach:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Custom signet mining improvement: #29032\r\n\r\nExploratory / experimental:\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/47\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48 (\"sidecar\" alternative approach using IPC)\r\n\r\nRelated useful:\r\n\r\n- [x] #29775 (most active sv2 testing is on testnet4)\r\n- [ ] #30209\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with any of the issues below, please open a PR to my fork. I will then squash your commits into my own where needed. \r\n\r\n## Things left todo\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] leverage cluster mempool for quicker push updates (see https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/52)\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/54",

However that involves implementing the sv2 noise protocol in Python and a bunch of other work to export transport functions to the functional test framework.

Here's a branch with both of them: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/tree/2024/05/transport\r\n\r\nI'd still like to move Transport out of `libbitcoin_node` into `libbitcoin_common`, but this is probably better done in a parallel PR.\r\n\r\nAt the request of people testing Stratum v2 I'm adding testnet4 to this branch, but bear in mind it's not final.\r\n\r\nI still need to do some manual testing on this last push, so be careful.",

      "body": "I'm strongly in favour of having Template Provider (TP) support for SV2, so thank you for your hard work on this @Sjors. I am very concerned about the scope of this approach though, and therefore leaning to an Approach NACK (but open to being persuaded otherwise).\r\n\r\nFrom my reading of the discussion in #27854, it seems the main technical hurdle to just having a separate `sv2tpd` daemon using `bitcoind`'s existing interfaces is `getblocktemplate`s having serious limitations as outlined [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27854#issuecomment-1587650914). That's a sensible concern, and one we need to address. \r\n\r\nCan the `getblocktemplate` concerns not (at least largely) be addressed by upgrading the existing RPC method, or adding a new one that's minimal in scope and not SV2 opinionated? I understand this will still be a pretty significant overhaul, but probably still significantly smaller than what is proposed at the moment?\r\n\r\nI'm happy to be convinced otherwise, but as it stands, implementing a separate `sv2tpd` process that uses `bitcoind`s (minimally) improved interfaces seems like a much more sensible approach to me, and afaict would still address all points listed in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/sv2/doc/stratum-v2.md#advantage-over-getblocktemplate-rpc . I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this.",

It could poll once a second, we'd need changes to hold on to previously generated templates, a new RPC to submit a solution that refers to a previous template and a few other things.\r\n\r\nAs a practical matter I'm not sure who would be implementing that; SRI is already a pretty complicated codebase with a shortage of developer resources.

That seems undesired?\r\n\r\nRegardless, I'm not sure the TP necessarily needs to hold on to block templates when `sv2tpd` caches all block template transactions and add any missing ones back to core through RPC before submitting a block? Perhaps the existing interfaces aren't sufficient currently, but then again - perhaps we could improve them instead of wholesale implementing sv2 logic?\r\n\r\n> I guess you're saying it should be separate software altogether\r\n\r\nYes, a separate project and a separate process would be my strong preference. Again, I do think it's important Bitcoin Core supports SV2 well.

      "body": "> But if the bitcoind interfaces are lacking for sv2tpd to be a separate project, I think we should first exhaust the possibilities of improving the interfaces before just incorporating (part of) the downstream project into Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nFWIW, my view is that indeed the current Bitcoin Core interfaces are inadequate for implementing template providers, and while it's probably possible to make a number of improvements to existing ones to improve the situation, the result will either be far from ideal still (RPC is not binary, ZMQ is only one-directional, ...), or quite different from anything we have now. And if we're going to make a substantially different interface for the purpose of template providing, it probably makes sense to just pick Sv2 to be that interface as it's designed exactly for that purpose. The encryption aspect of Sv2 isn't necessary for that, but if all `sv2tpd` would do is be an Sv2 encrypting proxy, it might be logistically just simpler to have Bitcoin Core also do the encryption aspect.\r\n\r\nSo this doesn't exclude the possibility that future block template providing protocols be implemented in external proxy servers, which then talk still talk Sv2 to Bitcoin Core, if that is still appropriate.",

      "body": "> I'm not sure I understand this. This PR is not an sv2 discussion, so if my understanding is wrong we don't need to talk about it here, but are you saying the pool will approve a proposed block template without having/keeping all the transactions? That seems undesired?\r\n\r\nThe [Job Declaration Protocol](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/06-Job-Declaration-Protocol.md) has a param `async_mining_allowed` which, if set, allows miners to immediately submit work even before the template has been approved. Afaik SRI currently just hardcodes this to true for simplicity (cc @fi3).\r\n\r\nApproval takes time, because we have to send the pool any transactions it's missing, and it needs to check those (SRI currently only checks that all transactions are present, no additional checks - I suspect that's a can of worms on its own, since there may be conflicts with the pool node mempool). During this time you would either have to mine on a pool template, or solo mine.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the merits of async mining, it's more robust for the miner to broadcast a found block themselves (this is done via the `SubmitSolution` message).\r\n\r\nExample of this actually going wrong (in testing): [#912](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/912)\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure the TP necessarily needs to hold on to block templates when sv2tpd caches all block template transactions and add any missing ones back to core through RPC before submitting a block?\r\n\r\nMaybe. But we also need to hold on to everything that was in the mempool at the time (an aspect I haven't thoroughly tested yet). From what I've seen in SRI, the Job Declarator Server (pool side) implements some sort of pseudo-mempool for that purpose.\r\n\r\n> Wouldn't it be more straightforward to implement this as a separate sv2tpd daemon versus incorporating it into Core\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it is. The two most practical approaches are improving this PR vs. expanding SRI. Building something from scratch is probably more work. Using a language other than Rust of c++ means re-writing the Noise implementation and other reusable code. The Bitcoin Core codebase has some very useful building blocks, e.g. the Transport class, BIP324 implementation (which we use parts of), well tested TCP socket handling code (unfortunately very tightly coupled with p2p, but refactoring that can be orthogonally useful), process separation in the pipeline (so it can crash without taking the node down - though so can a separate tool), good CI, and deterministic builds (so I can  easily and relatively safely ship this PR as its own binary).",

I would just prefer to be much more strict in cutting out all the parts that Core doesn't require to support sv2 downstream, i.e. I don't think the \"out-of-the-box\" aspect should at at all be a priority when that can reasonably be addressed with external tooling.\r\n\r\n> ...it might be logistically just simpler to have Bitcoin Core also do the encryption aspect.\r\n\r\nIt probably would be, but I'd much rather we keep the scope of Core limited. Where we draw the line is up for debate, but tooling for a highly specialized process (I think we're only expecting a small minority of nodes to be running SV2?) that _can_ be kept outside of Core absolutely should be, in my view.\r\n\r\n> ...well tested TCP socket handling code (unfortunately very tightly coupled with p2p, but refactoring that can be orthogonally useful), process separation in the pipeline (so it can crash without taking the node down - though so can a separate tool), good CI, and deterministic builds (so I can easily and relatively safely ship this PR as its own binary).\r\n\r\nAs much as I sympathize that setting up a new project includes a bunch of painful overhead that requires even more scarce developer resources, I don't think any of these are good reasons to bundle more code than necessary into Core, where it has a massive maintenance cost - even if it's less visible now.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think I'm going to withdraw from the conceptual discussion until I have more in-depth knowledge of the relevant code and protocol. To summarize: I think Core should have good support for being a SV2 Template Provider, and implementing parts of SV2 to do that makes sense. It still seems to me like the current approach is too invasive and too much of an unnecessary maintenance burden on this project.",

HWI is a working example of that, but that specific approach won't work here.\r\n\r\nI'm not very keen on starting from scratch with a new approach myself, but I can test and review alternative approaches that others work on.\r\n\r\nFor now I plan to keep rebasing this PR, occasionally releasing a binary. As long as I can get some prerequisite refactoring merged, that should be sustainable for a while.",

I opened a tracking issue on the SRI side: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/1032. Two downsides that come to mind (in addition to the need to install a separate tool):\r\n\r\n1. it limits the number of connected stratum clients to 1, since there's only one ZMQ template feed (that seems ok for the standard suggested sv2 configurations) \r\n2. it precludes the ability to make the template provider public facing, even with an external tool\r\n\r\n> I refuse to believe that re-implementing the entire networking stack, adding a noise protocol implementation and a new networking protocol is the best solution to having a non-RPC/non-poll based template provider.\r\n\r\nI think much of the complexity comes from that we don't have a stateful alternative to RPC, nor an authenticated alternative to p2p. This PR builds that from scratch. If BIP324, along with an authentication mechanism, had existed before Stratum v2 then it could have been built on top of that. In that case the Template Provider would just add a few (authenticated) p2p messages.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that authenticated p2p / stateful RPC has more use cases than just Stratum v2. Perhaps external wallets, lightning nodes, etc could use it - by adding a new stratum subprotocol. They could then e.g. subscribe to mempool updates for a set `scriptPubKeys`, something that currently requires painful mempool polling or using our wallet and then polling it.\r\n\r\nBut even if such use cases existed, maybe we'd want a _different_ protocol for those, based on BIP324 - or even just unix sockets since these examples typically run on the same machine. So even that might not justify the complexity. A mobile wallet or lightning node that connects to your home node could use this.\r\n\r\n> If stratum v2 is so great, then surely someone is willing to implement this. There are at least two new stratum v2 pools that should probably feel responsible for this.\r\n\r\nI think it's just one new pool: DMND.work (they have someone working on SRI). And one existing pool Braiins (their production firmware is about a year behind on spec changes). It remains to be seen if adopting stratum v2 gives them any business advantage. My impression is that if we leave it to just market forces, most pools will simply fix the encryption problem of stratum v1, which has clear market value, and ignore the decentralisation features that stratum v2 packages with that fix.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that Bitcoin Core must carry this burden, but if some open source devs don't make it a reality, the status quo of very few pools won't change - at least until something bad happens censorship wise.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdditionally we'd need a `submitsolution` RPC, and the node needs to hold on to previously generated templates. This replaces the \"push blocks to :8333\" in your diagram. It's a much shorter message than a full block, and at least in the current design the Template Provider doesn't (need to) know the full block. This your design already requires RPC access, adding `submitsolution` and having the TP software call it wouldn't be a difficult addition.",

That seems plausible to me, looking at the current implementation here (the templates are a few MB in size and the cache only holds on to a few of them). When a sv2 client submits a solution, stratumv2d gets the corresponding template from its cache and publishes it to Bitcoin Core on port :8333.\r\n\r\n> It's a much shorter message than a full block, and at least in the current design the Template Provider doesn't (need to) know the full block\r\n\r\nSo in my design the short messages would still happen between \"stratumv2d\" and its clients, while the full block is pushed to the bitcoin core node (or any number of other nodes), essentially broadcasting the block (which happens in any case).",

      "body": "> the new rpc could accept a list of template configs and the zmq publisher publishes a template for each config.\r\n\r\nI suppose the external application could forward each to the right client.\r\n\r\n> > it precludes the ability to make the template provider public facing, even with an external tool\r\n> \r\n> Why?\r\n\r\nBecause each consumer of this interface will have its own `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`, which it can't communicate without RPC access. This can be avoided by picking a single size for everyone, e.g. the current default of 4000, which might be acceptable.\r\n\r\n> When a sv2 client submits a solution, stratumv2d gets the corresponding template from its cache\r\n\r\nThis implies that stratumv2d has access to the all the transactions in the block, which it doesn't in the current design. The [NewTemplate](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/07-Template-Distribution-Protocol.md#72-newtemplate-server---client) message uses a merkle path. Imo the new ZQM interface should send the same information and no more, especially if we want to send multiple messages for each requested `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (and sigops) permutation.\r\n\r\nThe Template Provider application can then use the existing `-zmqpubhashblock` feed to send `SetNewPrevHash` efficiently.\r\n\r\nIn an alternative design the Template Provider could hold on to the entire proposed block. This would take more time, because it has to parse the whole block and reconstruct the merkle path it needs for `NewTemplate`.\r\n\r\nSending it back over p2p doesn't seem like a good idea, because it makes the configuration more complicated, making the Template Provider software connect over p2p, rpc and zmq, and requiring the user to whitelist that inbound p2p connection. And because finding a block is an extremely rare event, it would have to keep the p2p connection alive and make sure it actually works. It seems safer to use the `submitblock` RPC despite its overhead.\r\n\r\nThe number of full blocks to hold on to could also be quite large. Once cluster mempool is in place, we can push out new templates for every incremental sat in fees - the bottlenecks are the overhead an ASIC might have to switch work and for the Job Declarator Server to inspect it.\r\n\r\nTo take a perhaps unrealistic scenario: if we push one template per second for ten connected clients and there's one hour between blocks, that's 140 GB. Whereas Bitcoin Core can hold on to the same number of templates with much less overhead: CTransactionRef pointers plus holding on to included transactions that aren't in the mempool anymore.\r\n\r\nIn both approaches either we or the Template Provider have to be a bit smarter though, to let go of templates N seconds after we've sent a new one (with some allowance for the possibly that not all downstream machines pick up on every single new template). Otherwise large mempool churn could cause an OOM.",

Additionally that would be the time to make a BIP for the new p2p messages.\r\n\r\nOn the SRI side this may be simpler to implement; it just needs to convert between our p2p messages and their stratum v2 equivalent.\r\n\r\nFor a user this is easier to configure (though we still have the downside of having to install a separate piece of software, configure it and keep it running).\r\n\r\nA few things may make it (a lot) more complicated:\r\n\r\n- If we don't add `SocketTransport`, it will instead need to speak V1Transport or (preferably) V2Transport. Rust-bitcoin has a [BIP340](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bip324) but afaik it hasn't been integrated with their p2p message handling, see https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/discussions/2959.\r\n\r\n- It needs to implement our p2p handshake and keepalive stuff, though `SocketTransport` could dispense with some of that. I don't know how well the rust-bitcoin v1 p2p message handling works, e.g. if it takes care of this stuff. RPC is much easier to integrate with, not sure about ZMQ.\r\n\r\n- It needs to maintain a mapping between its incoming stratum v2 clients and p2p connections to the node. Especially for a public facing Template Provider. For that `SocketTransport` would need a way to represent multiple connections, either by connecting via multiple sockets or maybe by prefixing each message with a peer id.\r\n\r\n@dergoegge's proposal has similar issues, especially the variant that uses p2p to submit the block (hence my preference there to use RPC for that, despite the performance hit)",

      "body": "> I refuse to believe that re-implementing the entire networking stack, adding a noise protocol implementation and a new networking protocol is the best solution to having a non-RPC/non-poll based template provider.\r\n\r\nI left a comment at https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/1032#issuecomment-2211001835, but I don't buy that ZMQ is a reasonable way forward here. To be clear, the goal is not to *just* have \"a non-RPC/non-poll based template provider\", but rather to decentralize mining, where one part of that is to support providing work from Bitcoin Core to Sv2 mining proxies in a more efficient way. One important goal there is to support providing that work to untrusted open connections easily - miners may decide they don't want to select work and instead wish to outsource this to a third party, which needs to be as absolutely trivial to build as possible. We've seen time and time again \"just run this sidecar software next to Bitcoin Core\" is not a thing that anyone does.\r\n\r\nI also mention in that post that Bitcoin Core needs to eventually support providing work to miners - its an absolute travesty that today, in order to solo mine, you need to try 5 different unmaintained software stacks and hope one works (they probably dont), write your own software, or pay a few % fee to some \"solo pool\" (which find blocks even at today's hashrate!). The fact that there is no easy way to support the decentralization of the network for small miners who wish to do so is a total failure of the Bitcoin development community. That could be an external daemon, but again we have a long history of encouraging people to run contrib scripts or sidecar daemons and basically no one ever does. They might well just stick with \"solo pools\" instead :facepalm:.",

Obviously I'm not claiming all of these things should be in Bitcoin core, but there's some cost to them being outside - users rely on public block explorers and electrum servers giving up privacy, they use wallets that do not track and validate the full UTXO set (preventing proof-of-reserves for mints), etc. Now, some of that is because they want mobile wallets and apps rather than desktop software, but we've never managed to get sidecars of any form to be deployed broadly - only for those who are highly motivated.\n\n> Maintaining software is hard and by implementing all of this here, you're asking Bitcoin Core to take on this burden.

Maybe Sv2/SRI survives but I'd be astounded if it survived with the level of resources it has now, Bitcoin Core will always have way more resources than other things in the ecosystem (and that's great, it needs them). Again, of course, this isn't to say that Bitcoin Core should \"do all the things\", that's not realistically either, but Bitcoin Core can't dismiss things which are critical to the Bitcoin system as \"someone else will do it\".\n\n> This is obviously an important goal, and also a goal that one would think bitcoin users care enough about to be willing to install a second piece of software.\n\nThen you misunderstood my argument - miners *do not care* about decentralizing mining, we have ten years of proof of this. If decentralizing mining isn't trivial and the default option, they'll never do it.\n\n> I also mention in that post that Bitcoin Core needs to eventually support providing work to miners - me\n\nI believe you missed this point - Bitcoin Core needs to support providing work, it's not excusable that it does not today (outside of \"no one has contributed the code yet\"). An obvious way to do that would be to add code here for the Sv2 framing and then also add the Sv2 work protocol (which is similarly pretty trivial once we have the framing in place). Alternatively Bitcoin Core could support Sv1 but that's an undocumented mess and missing lots of critical features.",

      "body": "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29432#issuecomment-2211245443\r\n\r\n> Yet another approach for said sidecar is to use IPC. It offers first class access to the node, e.g. via the newly added mining interface. It can probably automagically find a running Bitcoin Core process or spin one up. This would require more (review) progress in #10102 and additional tooling so external application can easily use IPC.\r\n\r\nI don't actually think much in #10102 is needed, because the bulk of #10102 is wrapping the Wallet interface so the gui can use it, and the Chain interface so the wallet can use it. The mining interface is much smaller than the chain/node/wallet interfaces so it should be much easier to expose. If it would help, I could make a draft PR for a test program that will do what you describe: connect to bitcoin-node over a unix socket if it is running, or start bitcoin-node if it is not running, and then call a mining interface function like `getTipHash()` and print the result.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29432#issuecomment-2218139440\r\n\r\nNiklas, everything you're saying may be true but it doesn't seem self evident. I could imagine there being difficulties with the current approach, but I can also imagine it working out well. It also seems like there is a spectrum of intermediate possibilities between current monolithic design, and your [zmq + rpc suggestion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29432#pullrequestreview-2156406658) and [sjors p2p over local socket](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29432#issuecomment-2210448369) design, or other possibilities.\r\n\r\nSo I am curious what design you think would be simplest, best for users, and most maintainable in the long run if there was not a lack of resources in the short run? I agree with you the lack resources is real, and maybe will completely dictate any decision. But I wonder if there is actual disagreement over what the best software design would be if not for that? I do think miner centralization is a problem that is worth spending significant effort to solve, that miners are probably not well equipped to solve themselves even if they are motivated. From my own perspective, I think there's not really a point in bitcoin existing if mining becomes and remains very centralized.",

      "body": "> Niklas, everything you're saying may be true but it doesn't seem self evident.\r\n\r\nCertainly! I think most of what I (and Matt) said are opinions and not ground truths. It does look like most of the actual discussion is philosophical in nature (software maintenance, willingness of users to run more than one piece of software, ...) and the eventual route we go will depend on a judgement call, which is why I find it important that more contributors with opinions chime in.\r\n\r\n> I could imagine there being difficulties with the current approach, but I can also imagine it working out well.\r\n\r\nYes, I wouldn't definitively say that the current approach can't work, but it is my opinion that it would be better for Bitcoin Core and stratumv2 users to go a different route.\r\n\r\n> So I am curious what design you think would be simplest, best for users, and most maintainable in the long run if there was not a lack of resources in the short run?\r\n\r\nI think our lack of resources will be the key factor in making a decision but there are other things I'm concerned about as well, which could inform the design.\r\n\r\n1. Widening the public facing attack surface\r\n2. DRY violations: e.g. the stratumv2 encryption looks quite similar to BIP324, yet another networking server (that is architecturally a copy of the already existing stack), ...\r\n3. Lack of separation of concerns. Producing good block templates is one concern, implementing the most functional & secure/safe way to serve them is another one.\r\n\r\nThese are mostly maintenance concerns, that exist even with plenty of available resources.\r\n\r\nA multi-process architecture would be the best way to go in my opinion, i.e. a separate process talking to Bitcoin Core through some interface(s) acting as a proxy for the stratumv2 side. This approach should address concern 3. fully, it cleanly separates the concern of producing templates and serving them to untrusted third parties. It lessens concern 1. since bugs in the stratumv2 process won't affect general node operations (e.g. a crash bug doesn't take down the whole node). Depending on the specific implementation detail choices it can also address concern 2. Generally, there are a few implementation details that would have to be answered for this approach:\r\n\r\n* _a) How does the separate process communicate with the node process? (ipc, p2p, rpc, zmq, ...)_\r\n  I think any interface would technically work and all besides p2p would be appropriate (ipc, rpc or zmq are primarily meant for exchanging data with a trusted (local) endpoint, and are therefore suitable). A combination of these interfaces allows for a request/response pattern (like I described in my initial comment). Changes to these interfaces are possible, to accommodate the use-case of the stratumv2 process.\r\n* _b) Does it share code with Bitcoin Core? If not, is there a need to write it in C++?_\r\n  I think if we're already green fielding a stratumv2 server we might as well do it in a memory-safe language, which probably means no code sharing.\r\n* _c) Is the process a child of the node process or is it externally spawned (e.g. manually by a user)?_ How is this packaged in a user friendly way?_\r\n  These questions mostly concern themselves with the user experience, i.e. how will this be shipped and how is it supposed to be operated. There are so many ways of doing this and I'm sure we could come up with a way to make it easy for users. It depends on what the answer to b) is, e.g. we might end up being able to spawn the stratumv2 process through `fork()` or if it is a separate piece of software entirely, we might be able to auto-detect the installation and go from there.\r\n\r\nTLDR: I would suggest a design very similar to my original suggestion (implementation details may vary), although, given the assumption of no lack of resources, we could end up maintaining and shipping the separate tool along side bitcoind as well.\r\n\r\n> I think there's not really a point in bitcoin existing if mining becomes and remains very centralized.\r\n\r\nAgreed but I don't see how the specific software architecture choices discussed here so far have a catastrophic impact on the outcome. They do however, have a sizable impact on Bitcoin Core.",

      "body": "> Because not everyone needs to run these things but if they want to they can. Cramming everything into one software project is not sustainable.\r\n\r\nI don't think you read what I wrote. I said \"Obviously I'm not claiming all of these things should be in Bitcoin core, but there's some cost to them being outside\". Which implies, obviously I agree with you that \"cramming everything into one software project is not sustainable\", but claiming that *the* reason people don't run these projects is because they \"dont need to\" is absurd. There is very real cost for each of the examples I gave that implies people should run these things. Again, for practical purposes it likely doesn't make sense for them to exist in Bitcoin Core, but there's a line, and it isn't \"nothing that could be in an external project\".\r\n\r\n> If it would end up unmaintained outside of Bitcoin Core, then it'd also end up unmaintained inside of it.\r\n\r\nOh come on. There are drastically different levels of \"unmaintained\". The mining software I refer to here is software that is not runnable, that does not work with current versions of Bitcoin Core, sometimes doesn't build on modern toolchains, etc. That level of maintenance any part of Bitcoin Core would absolutely receive.\r\n\r\nIf it would end up unmaintained outside of Bitcoin Core, that may mean that it would get one patch a year inside of it, which would be great! Means very little burden on any Bitcoin Core maintainers or contributors, but it would keep building and basic functionality covered by tests would continue to work!\r\n\r\n> I'll repeat what I said above. There are several startups that are using stratumv2, they should be interested in maintaining the software that they plan to build their business on. There are also several billion dollar mining companies that should be interested in paying for the maintenance of the software they depend on.\r\n\r\nI very, very, very, very much wish I had your level of optimism about the world and about open source software in general. But I really don't see where your optimism comes from...\r\n\r\n> In any case, looking at how things usually work in this project, it'll likely be years until the current approach would be merged anyway (due to a lack of resources). Would it not be better to focus on an approach that will be operational much sooner?\r\n\r\nTo be clear, people are using this patchset already, and will likely continue to do so. Upstreaming it just means that people can benefit from the review and secure builds processes of Bitcoin Core, rather than the Bitcoin mining ecosystem all trusting a random binary posted by Sjors...",

That hurts usability and maintainability.\r\n\r\nI'd like to try the IPC approach. If you can make the demo in rust that would be ideal, because it would allow me to reuse parts of SRI and other useful bitcoin libraries. I think @josibake is working on something similar.\r\n\r\nThat said, I suspect our `CConnman` and `Transport` classes are in better shape than any Bitcoin Rust library out there including SRI. Not being able to use (derivatives of) them is a big downside. \r\n\r\n@dergoegge wrote:\r\n\r\n> A multi-process architecture would be the best way to go in my opinion, i.e. a separate process talking to Bitcoin Core through some interface(s) acting as a proxy for the stratumv2 side. \r\n\r\nNote that process seperation is something I want to achieve with the current approach as well.

Afaik it's used by all miners, with various levels of custom patching that they don't always contribute back. We've made very little changes to it, but it still works after a decade because it rides on the maintenance of the rest of our codebase.

Being part of the Bitcoin Core codebase can be a way for a smaller piece of code to get better maintainence than being independent.

      "body": "I am just catching up on this thread so I haven't really made up my mind on the conceptual question overall. But if we could wave our magic wand to have multiprocess plus sv2 based on that that sounds like a great achievement for the project overall. Adding multiprocess support would take its time though, these would then be two large projects that have been around for a long time but struggled to get enough review power. If sv2 could help move multiprocess forward that would be great but given that it's struggling to get review on its own I don't see that happening unfortunately.\r\n\r\nAn approach that came to my mind and I don't think I have seen mentioned yet: Could everything sv2 related at least be self-contained so that we can build without it like `--disable-sv2`? Then there could be a release policy to start with where we release core without sv2 as a priority and then there is an additional release with sv2 on a best-effort basis. I.e. if the code is broken and nobody steps up to fix it and miners don't want to pay anyone to do it, then there will be no sv2 release. Maybe this \"miner release\" could even be without the GUI to further ensure that this is not the version normal users should use. They could have their own set of builders too and maybe the binary is not even released on bitcoin-core.org but somewhere else. Having another set of binaries flying around is not ideal either but at least this could decouple sv2 support from the general engineering bottleneck. Having this clear separation should also make it much easier to move sv2 into its own process when we get multiprocess support later.\r\n\r\nEDIT: This would also mean that sv2 support should be easy to remove again if this \"experiment\" fails.",

      "body": "It seems to me two topics are being debated here, one about software design and the other about how we get users to run software.\r\n\r\n## Technical design\r\n\r\nI agree with @dergoegge that there have been no _technical_ objections to a multi-process approach, i.e., a `stratumv2` sidecar talking to `bitcoind` via some sort of communication protocol. Instead, I find the arguments for a multi-process architecture to be compelling and the correct _technical_ design. Specifically, exposing a somewhat generic mining interface not specific to SV1/SV2 is the correct long-term choice. Of the proposed multi-process approaches, I've been experimenting with talking to a `bitoin-node` process over a socket using [rust + capnproto](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/bitcoin-ipc) and have been pleasantly surprised at how performant and powerful this approach is. As @Sjors mentioned, there are existing rust libraries for stratum and bitcoin related stuff in rust, so it seems we could vet this approach easily and compare it to alternatives.\r\n\r\nAs @ryanofsky mentioned, I think the only thing needed to explore this route further is defining a capnproto schema for the mining interface and exposing it over a socket. I've already got a working example of launching a `bitcoin-node` process and talking to it from a rust process over a socket. From what I can tell, if we have the mining interface defined, it should be trivial to adapt this example to an SV2 proof of concept. Out of the proposed architectures, this is the approach I find to be the most technically sound and interesting, so happy to help if people are interested in exploring this route further.\r\n\r\n## All the other stuff\r\n\r\nI sympathize with the argument that the harder we make things for the user, the less likely they are to run the software. I strongly disagree, however, with the conclusion that the best solution then is to put everything into a single binary for the user. All that matters for the user is that it Just Works :tm: and there are plenty of ways we can achieve this regardless of the technical design.\r\n\r\nAs a Bitcoin Core user, if I'm not mining then I don't want mining code in my binary. If I'm a Bitcoin Core user who is mining, there isn't any reason I can't install one piece of mining software that automatically launches a `bitcoin-node` process or discovers an already running one.",

If you don't start with `-sv2` none of this code is run. That should be even more clear if it has its own `libbitcoin_sv2` library (which needs something like https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/47).\r\n\r\n@josibake wrote:\r\n\r\n>  it should be trivial to adapt this example to an SV2 proof of concept\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say trivial, but certainly worth exploring.\r\n\r\n@fjahr wrote:\r\n\r\n> They could have their own set of builders too and maybe the binary is not even released on bitcoin-core.org but somewhere else.\r\n\r\nCurrently I use the opposite approach, where I build binaries based on this PR while it's not merge ready. With the right code separation it shouldn't be too hard to keep this rebased.\r\n\r\nIn any case it will take time for any of the suggested sidecar approaches to reach feature parity with this PR. Since people are actually use this, I'll have to keep maintaining it for a while and release those binaries anyway.",

I strongly disagree, however, with the conclusion that the best solution then is to put everything into a single binary for the user. All that matters for the user is that it Just Works ™️ and there are plenty of ways we can achieve this regardless of the technical design.\r\n\r\nRight, I don't at think anyone was making the argument that it *has* to be in the same process, but rather in the same project so that Just Works is even an option. In principle I have no strong opinion about multi-process (as long as the interface is sufficiently performant - one very old complaint about `getblocktemplate` is we end up wasting multiple milliseconds encoding all the crap we shove in there, then wasting another multi milliseconds dealing with JSON parsing on the other end, all right when we're trying to reserve precious CPU time to validate blocks and update the mempool and all kinds of other crap), but only that it must Just Work, and getting multi-process to Just Work is a very nontrivial task unto itself. Blocking any Sv2 support on that seems like it will take something really critical for the Bitcoin system that is already gonna take a while and make it take forever instead.",

Secondly, even if it is more work, process separation has been a project that has had conceptual buy in for quite some time. Given the limited review capacity, we should be looking for two birds, one stone opportunities wherever they arise. If building out SV2 on top of the multiprocess work helps get more review and attention on mulitprocess, this feels like a win to me. Furthermore, from what I understood, there is existing SV2 code in rust. Pursuing a multiprocess approach allows us to reuse that code, rather than rewriting everything in C++ so it can be in `bitcoind`. I don't want to reopen a debate about which project stuff should live under, but given there are currently engineers working on SV2 stuff in rust, it seems more productive to let them apply their SV2 knowledge in their language of choice to building a `stratumv2d` process that can talk to a mining interface in `bitcoind`.",

So any interface you would like to implement should be possible to implement.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29432#issuecomment-2222418506\r\n\r\n> > If it would help, I could make a draft PR for a test program that will do what you describe: connect to bitcoin-node over a unix socket if it is running, or start bitcoin-node if it is not running, and then call a mining interface function like `getTipHash()` and print the result.\r\n> \r\n> Yes that would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nI got a c++ test program working that connects to the bitcoin node over a unix socket and calls the [`getTipHash()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export.653/src/bitcoin-mine.cpp#L122-L127) function.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export.653/src/bitcoin-mine.cpp#L19-L39\r\n\r\nIt will also spawn the `bitcoin-node` process if it is not currently running. This is written on top of my combined IPC branch, so the branch has a lot of other changes that are unneeded and unrelated. But I think I can trim it down to a reasonable sized PR. I'll try trimming it down tomorrow. (EDIT: The trimmed down branch is posted in #30437)\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to write a similar program in rust, too, but I basically don't know any rust, so this was easier for me to get working in c++. The rust program would have to start `bitcoin-node` with the `-ipcbind=unix` option, connect to the `<datadir>/sockets/bitcoin-node.sock` socket, use the rust capnproto runtime to call [`Init.makeMining`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export.653/src/ipc/capnp/init.capnp#L30) over the socket and then call [`Mining.getTipHash`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/ipc-export.653/src/ipc/capnp/mining.capnp#L21) on the returned `Mining` interface. That would be equivalent to what the c++ program is doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> the framework is nonblocking, so there is no problem with the client making multiple calls at the same time, and the client can also decide what threads in the server the calls run on. So any interface you would like to implement should be possible to implement.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that helps. I was also a bit confused, so let me rephrase it:\r\n\r\nThe current interface `createNewBlock` returns a template, which contains 4 MB of serialized transaction data. Ideally I would _not_ include those transactions, but only the result of `GetMerklePathForCoinbase`, which is all we need for the `NewTemplate` message.\r\n\r\nI would then make another call to the interface to get those transactions, but by that that time the node has already forgotten the template it gave me and the mempool may have dropped some of the transactions it included.\r\n\r\nI don't think this can be solved with making both calls at the same time; the second call needs to reference a specific template that the first call generated.\r\n\r\n> I got a c++ test program working\r\n\r\nWill take it for a spin!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate: it works! If it helps getting IPC stuff merged quicker, it's fine by me if the miner can't spin up a node process (see e.g. https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/commit/b6dfa5f186e8a4813db21b2547de98280643f51a). Instead it could simply check every second and in the meanwhile show a message:\r\n\r\n> Please start Bitcoin Core, e.g.:\r\n> bitcoin-node -ipcbind=unix\r\n\r\nLater on the GUI could have a check box \"Enable IPC\" under \"Enable RPC server\", which under the hood ensures the node process listens.\r\n\r\n(Even fancier: it always listens and as soon anything tries to connect it prompts for permission and remembers the \"pairing\")\r\n\r\nEase of implementation aside, automagically starting the node from a miner application might also lead to confusion. Desktop users are not used to Bitcoin Core having a separate daemon (we can introduce this later, but starting from the GUI).\r\n\r\nIf we ship this functionality before full GUI IPC support is ready, then presumably the user has to run `bitcoin-node` and shut it down before starting the non-IPC `bitcoin-qt`. Or we might add IPC support to `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt`, but only for the miner interface. In either case it's better if the user themselves decides if they want to launch bitcoind or the gui. (or bitcoin-miner could prompt the user which one they want to launch)",
