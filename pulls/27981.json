    "body": "See https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/issues/1233. There, it has been observed that if both sides of a P2P connection have a significant amount of data to send, a stall can occur, where both try to drain their own send queue before trying to receive. The same issue seems to apply to the current Bitcoin Core codebase, though I don't know whether it's a frequent issue for us.\r\n\r\nThe core issue is that whenever our optimistic send fails to fully send a message, we do subsequently not even select() for receiving; if it then turns out that sending is not possible either, no progress is made at all. To address this, the solution used in this PR is to still select() for both sending and receiving when an optimistic send fails, but skip receiving if sending succeeded, and (still) doesn't fully drain the send queue.\r\n\r\nThis is a significant reduction in how aggressive the \"receive pushback\" mechanism is, because now it will only mildly push back while sending progress is made; if the other side stops receiving entirely, the pushback disappears. I don't think that's a serious problem though:\r\n* We still have a pushback mechanism at the application buffer level (when the application receive buffer overflows, receiving is paused until messages in the buffer get processed; waiting on our own net_processing thread, not on the remote party).\r\n* There are cases where the existing mechanism is too aggressive; e.g. when the send queue is non-empty, but tiny, and can be sent with a single send() call. In that case, I think we'd prefer to still receive within the same processing loop of the network thread.\r\n",

      "body": "> The core issue is that whenever our optimistic send fails to fully send a message, we do subsequently not even select() for receiving; if it then turns out that sending is not possible either, no progress is made at all. To address this, the solution used in this PR is to still select() for both sending and receiving when an optimistic send fails, but skip receiving if sending succeeded, and (still) doesn't fully drain the send queue.\r\n\r\nAIUI (correct me if I'm wrong!) the backpressure we do is:\r\n\r\n * `fPauseSend` -- we won't do `ProcessMessage` (which would probably cause us to generate new data to send) when this is set, which is when we have more than 1MB of data lined up. (However we *will* do `SendMessages`, which generates relatively small messages like INVs and PING and GETDATA)\r\n * `fPauseRecv` -- we won't select the socket for reading any more once we've got more than 5MB in parsed messages queued up to process\r\n * prefer sending over receiving -- if we've got data to send, we'll prioritise sending it, even if we're making no forward progress and could receive messages, to the point where we don't even check (via select/poll) to see if there's any data to receive when we've got data to send\r\n\r\nThis patches changes the latter logic to be:\r\n\r\n * prefer sending over receiving -- always see if we can send/receive data, but don't actually try to receive data until either (a) we don't have data to send in the first place, (b) we can't send any data, or (c) we've successfully sent all the data we have.\r\n\r\nThis seems pretty sensible to me: this is a peer to peer protocol, so it seems to me we should be making progress in parallel on sending and receiving whenever possible -- your send is my receive after all.\r\n\r\nApproach ACK.",

Therefore the received data will pile up without being cleared by `net_processing`. When `pnode->m_msg_process_queue_size` becomes too large (5MB), `fPauseRecv` will also be set, and after that we are again in a deadlock situation where both peers are sending and none is receiving. I could observe this with the added logging in the 3rd commit in my branch.\r\n\r\nNot sure how to best fix this...",

      "body": "I think `fPauseSend` getting set on both sides and causing a deadlock should probably be out of scope for this PR -- at least as I understand it, this fixes an issue where we get a deadlock even without `fPauseSend` triggering.\r\n\r\nI think the scenario here is:\r\n\r\n * peer A sends a 2MB message to peer B. This fills up B's socket receive buffer (200kB?) and A's socket send buffer (200kB?) without completing. A still has 1.6MB to send to B, so stops reading from the socket.\r\n * peer B does the same thing at almost exactly the same time, with the same result.\r\n * A/B are deadlocked.\r\n\r\nMaybe adding a debug-only sendp2pmsg rpc would be the easiest way to simulate this and be useful for debugging p2p things in general?\r\n\r\nIf we do want to address `fPauseSend` deadlocking, a few approaches come to mind:\r\n\r\n 1. easy: make fPauseSend a timestamp rather than a boolean, and if it's been set for >5 minutes, disconnect. doesn't prevent the deadlock, but at least frees up the connection slot and makes it possible to try again.\r\n 2. hard: rework net_processing so that we keep making as much progress as we can -- eg, change `fPauseSend` to continue processing incoming block or tx messages, but to skip GETDATA messages and to defer sending out INV messages and the like, so that we're draining as much traffic as we can, while limiting how much gets added.\r\n 3. impossible? add more dynamic traffic throttling: if you're bandwidth limited and getting too much TX traffic, perhaps you should be raising your feefilter level even if your mempool isn't full? I don't see how to generalise that if it's blocks or header messages or something else that cause a problem though.",

Fixing the application buffer side one indeed seems a lot harder, and probably needs discussion beyond this PR.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have a test for the network side one, without it also triggering the application side one, to verify this PR actually fixes something. Especially as I don't understand @psgreco's earlier observation (where an older version of this PR unconditionally preferred sending, which shouldn't improve the situation at all) as a means to validate it.",
