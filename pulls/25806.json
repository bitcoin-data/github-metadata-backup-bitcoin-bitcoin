    "body": "The idea originates from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24845#issuecomment-1130310321.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nFor clarity, it's recommended to start reviewing from the end result to understand the structure of the flow.\r\n\r\n#### GroupOutputs function rationale:\r\nIf \"Avoid Partial Spends\" is enabled, the function gathers outputs with the same script together inside a container. So Coin Selection can treats them as if them were just one possible input and either select them all or not select them. \r\n\r\n#### How the Inputs Fetch + Selection process roughly works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Fetch user’s manually selected inputs.\r\n2. Fetch wallet available coins (walks through the entire wallet txes map) and insert them into a set of vectors (each vector store outputs from a single type).\r\n3. Coin Selection Process:\r\n   Call `AttemptSelection` 8 times. Each of them expands the coin eligibility filter (accepting a larger subset of coins in the calculation) until it founds a solutions or completely fails if no solutions gets founds after the 8 rounds.\r\n\r\n   Each `AttemptSelection` call performs the following actions:\r\n     - For each output type supported by the wallet (P2SH, P2PK, P2WPKH, P2WSH and a combination of all of them):\r\n       Call ‘ChooseSelectionResult’ providing the respective, filtered by type, coins vector. Which:\r\n           I. Groups the outputs vector twice (one for positive only and a second one who includes the negative ones as well).\r\n              - GroupOutputs walks-through the entire inputted coins vector one time at least, + more if we are avoiding partial spends, to generate a vector of OutputGroups.\r\n           II. Then performs every coin selection algorithm using the recently created vector of OutputGroup: (1) BnB, (2) knapsack and (3) SRD.\r\n           III. Then returns the best solution out of them.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe perform the general operation of gathering outputs, with the same script, into a single container inside:\r\nEach coins selection attempt (8 times —> each coin eligibility filter), for each of the outputs vector who were filtered by type (plus another one joining all the outputs as well if needed), twice (one for the positive only outputs effective value and a second one for all of them).\r\n\r\nSo, in the worst case scenario where no solution is found after the 8 Coin Selection attempts, the `GroupOutputs` function is called 80 times (8 * 5 * 2).\r\n\r\n#### Improvements:\r\n\r\nThis proposal streamlines the process so that the output groups, filtered by coin eligibility and type, are created in a single loop outside of the Coin Selection Process. \r\n\r\nThe new process is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Fetch user’s manually selected inputs.\r\n2. Fetch wallet available coins.\r\n3. Group outputs by each coin eligibility filter and each different output type found.\r\n4. Coin Selection Process: \r\n   Call AttemptSelection 8 times. Each of them expands the coin eligibility filter (accepting different output groups) until it founds a solutions or completely fails if no solutions gets founds after the 8 rounds.\r\n   \r\n   Each ‘AttemptSelection’ call performs the following actions:\r\n      - For each output type supported by the wallet (P2SH, P2PK, P2WPKH, P2WSH and all of them):\r\n          A. Call ‘ChooseSelectionResult’ providing the respective, filtered by type, output group. Which:\r\n             I. Performs every coin selection algorithm using the provided vector of OutputGroup: (1) BnB, (2) knapsack and (3) SRD.\r\n             II. Then returns the best solution out of them.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExtra Note:\r\nThe next steps after this PR will be to:\r\n1) Merge `AvailableCoins` and `GroupOutputs` processes.\r\n2) Skip entire coin selection rounds if no new coins are added into the subsequent round.\r\n3) Remove global feerates from the OutputGroup class.\r\n4) Remove secondary \"grouped\" tx creation from `CreateTransactionInternal` by running Coin Selection results over the aps grouped outputs vs non-aps ones.",

This is needed for point (1) as otherwise the wallet will spend the coins that we recently created due its closeness to the recipient amount.\r\nNote: this last point comes from #25659 where I'm using the same functionality to clean/speedup another flow as well.",

In order to correctly detect such inputs, we need to be doing `IsMine` on all specified inputs in order to use `Select` and `SelectExternal` correctly. Additionally `SelectCoins` needs to call `CalculateMaximumSignedInputSize` with the correct parameters which depends on whether the wallet is able to solve for the input. Because there are some situations where the wallet could find an external input to belong to it (e.g. watching an address - unable to solve, but will be ISMINE_WATCHONLY), instead of switching which `CalculateMaximumSignedInputSize` to use, we should call the one that uses the wallet, and if that fails, try again with the one that uses external solving data.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a test for this case.",

          "body": "Currently `FundTransaction` handles transaction locktime and preset input data by extracting the selected inputs and change output from `CreateTransaction`'s results. This means that `CreateTransaction` is actually unaware of any user desired locktime or sequence numbers. This can have an effect on whether and how anti-fee-sniping works.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `CreateTransaction` aware of the locktime and preset input data by providing them to `CCoinControl`. `CreateTransasction` will then set the sequences, scriptSigs, scriptWItnesses, and locktime as appropriate if they are specified. This allows `FundTransaction` to actually use `CreateTransaction`'s result directly instead of having to extract the parts of it that it wants.\r\n\r\nAdditionally `FundTransaction` will return a `CreateTransactionResult` as `CreateTransaction` does instead of having several output parameters. Lastly, instead of using `-1` as a magic number for the change output position, the change position is changed to be an optional with no value set indicating no desired change output position (when provided as an input parameter) or no change output present (in the result).",

          "title": "[Draft / POC] Silent Payments",
          "body": "This PR proposes an early version of [Silent Payment](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8) (author:@RubenSomsen).\r\nIn this scheme, the recipient generates a public address, but the sender tweaks the address and the recipient detects the payment by verifying all transactions on the blockchain. An example use case would be private donations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is not a final version, but to start the discussion and get benchmarks based on a real implementation.\r\n\r\nThis version is built on top of [#994](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/994) (bitcoin-core/secp256k1) for x-only ECDH support and #23480 (bitcoin/bitcoin) for `rawtr()`. Each new silent transaction detected is stored in wallet as a `rawtr()` descriptor. \r\n\r\nIn this implementation, the sender can tweak the recipient address by passing the `silent_payment` option to send RPC. The transaction output will be different from the address entered.\r\n\r\nFor example `./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named send outputs=\"[{\\\"bcrt1pwlh5xuyrpgfunwyww8cfu78yfs2yqyevl7yturavahh5kgxwdd2q5hzgfu\\\": 1.1}]\" fee_rate=1 options=\"{ \\\"silent_payment\\\": true}\"`.\r\n\r\nwill generate `vout` with completely unrelated outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"vout\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 1.10000000,\r\n      \"n\": 0,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(65b19890c5ca40edb816d26f5f48cd9f3ed51121613b1c2405adc1a6dbbc824a)#8myx9tcu\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pvkce3yx9efqwmwqk6fh47jxdnuld2yfpvya3cfq94hq6dkausf9qrfjkgz\",\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 2.02499835,\r\n      \"n\": 1,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(c45cb3d500bbf8f0c8841e8e011b008781d826c16ee348edb822c0f97419bc4d)#26hcce63\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pc3wt84gqh0u0pjyyr68qzxcqs7qasfkpdm353mdcytq0jaqeh3xsuvlykg\",\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny wallet, as long as it has access to private keys, can send silent payments. Thus, this excludes watch-only wallets or wallets with external signers .\r\n\r\nBut the recipient's wallet needs a new flag called `SILENT_PAYMENT`. This flag allows an additional scan that verifies that the wallet keys match the silent payment scheme. When it detects a silent payment that belongs to the wallet, it is stored in a `rawtr()` descriptor.\r\n\r\n`./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named createwallet wallet_name=\"recipient\" silent_payment=true`\r\n\r\nTherefore, scanning each address for each transaction is potentially prohibitive overhead, so the node can be initialized with `keypool=1` or a descriptor with range [0,1] can be imported into a blank wallet. Until there is more benchmark data, it is the safest option. The proposal recommends one static address.\r\n\r\nI've been running some silent payments on signet using wallets with default keypool and default range, I haven't noticed any relevant performance drops on the signet node.\r\nApparently this implementation is working as expected but I can't guarantee that the scheme is implemented correctly or safely, so I'm opening this PR for reviews, modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nThere is a new functional test (`test/functional/wallet_silentpayment.py`) that can help to better understand the implementation.",

          "body": "This PR changes DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to no longer handle relevant keys directly. Instead all keys for all DescriptorSPKMs will be handled by a new `KeyManager` class which exists within `CWallet` (a reference to it is passed to each DescriptorSPKM). This allows us to have a concept of a wallet HD key for descriptor wallets. This makes it easier to add new single key descriptors that use the same HD master key as the rest of the autogenerated descriptors (e.g. for taproot). Multisigs will also be easier as an xpub belonging to the wallet can be exported without needing to do weird things like descriptor introspection and guessing about which descriptor's key to use.\r\n\r\n`KeyManager` is a class which handles all of the keys for DescriptorSPKMs. It contains the maps that hold the keys, deals with writing those keys to disk, and handles their encryption. Encryption keys are still managed by `CWallet` but provided to `KeyManager` through the `WalletStorage` interface. Signing is still done through `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::SignTransaction` however this will fetch the keys from `KeyManager` rather than storing keys in the DescriptorSPKM to be used.\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards compatible. Although `KeyManager` writes and uses keys in new `keyman_key` and `keyman_ckey` records, it will still write keys for each descriptor in `walletdescriptorkey` and `walletdescriptorckey` records. This allows a descriptor wallet created using this change to be opened by 22.0 and 0.21. Additionally, wallets created with older software will automatically be upgraded to using the `KeyManager` at first loading. This is done in the background and does not require any user interaction (i.e. no passphrase required).",

          "title": "wallet: Faster transaction creation by removing pre-set-inputs fetching responsibility from Coin Selection",
          "body": "#### # Context (Current Flow on Master)\r\n\r\nIn the transaction creation process, in order to select which coins the new transaction will spend,\r\nwe first obtain all the available coins known by the wallet, which means walking-through the\r\nwallet txes map, gathering the ones that fulfill certain spendability requirements in a vector.\r\n\r\nThis coins vector is then provided to the Coin Selection process, which first checks if the user\r\nhas manually selected any input (which could be internal, aka known by the wallet, or external),\r\nand if it does, it fetches them by searching each of them inside the wallet and/or inside the\r\nCoin Control external tx data.\r\n\r\nThen, after finding the pre-selected-inputs and gathering them in a vector, the Coin Selection\r\nprocess walks-through the entire available coins vector once more just to erase coins that are\r\nin both vectors. So the Coin Selection process doesn’t pick them twice (duplicate inputs inside\r\nthe same transaction).\r\n\r\n#### # Process Workflow Changes\r\n\r\nNow, a new method, `FetchCoins` will be responsible for:\r\n1) Lookup the user pre-selected-inputs (which can be internal or external).\r\n2) And, fetch the available coins in the wallet (excluding the already fetched ones).\r\n\r\nWhich will occur prior to the Coin Selection process. Which allows us to never include the\r\npre-selected-inputs inside the available coins vector in the first place, as well as doing other\r\nnice improvements (written below).\r\n\r\nSo, Coin Selection can perform its main responsibility without mixing it with having to fetch\r\ninternal/external coins nor any slow and unneeded duplicate coins verification.\r\n\r\n#### # Summarizing the Improvements:\r\n\r\n1) If any pre-selected-input lookup fail, the process will return the error right away.\r\n    (before, the wallet was fetching all the wallet available coins, walking through the\r\n    entire txes map, and then failing for an invalid pre-selected-input inside SelectCoins)\r\n\r\n2) The pre-selected-inputs lookup failure causes are properly described on the return error.\r\n    (before, we were returning an \"Insufficient Funds\" error for everything, even if the failure\r\n    was due a not solvable external input)\r\n\r\n3) **Faster Coin Selection**: no longer need to \"remove the pre-set inputs from the available coins\r\n    vector so that Coin Selection doesn't pick them\" (which meant to loop-over the entire\r\n    available coins vector at Coin Selection time, erasing duplicate coins that were pre-selected).\r\n   \r\n    Now, the available coins vector, which is built after the pre-selected-inputs fetching,\r\n    doesn’t include the already selected inputs in the first place.\r\n\r\n4) **Faster transaction creation** for transactions that only use manually selected inputs.\r\n\r\n    We now will return early, as soon as we finish fetching the pre-selected-inputs and\r\n    not perform the resources expensive calculation of walking-through the entire wallet\r\n    txes map to obtain the available coins (coins that we will not use).\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nAdded a new bench (f6d0bb2) measuring the transaction creation process, for a wallet with ~250k UTXO, only using the pre-selected-inputs inside coin control. Setting `m_allow_other_inputs=false` to disallow the wallet to include coins automatically.\r\n\r\n#### Result on this PR (tip f6d0bb2d):\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|        1,048,675.00 |              953.58 |    0.3% |      0.06 | `WalletCreateTransaction`\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n#### Result on master (tip 4a4289e2):\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       96,373,458.20 |               10.38 |    0.2% |      5.30 | `WalletCreateTransaction`\r\n\r\nThe benchmark took to run in master: **96.37 milliseconds**, while in this PR: **1 millisecond**  🚀 .",

Also, commit `wallet: switch to new shuffle, erase, push_back` will fail to compile, but this is fixed in the next commit with a scripted-diff. the commits are separate like this (code change then scripted-diff) to improve legibility.\r\n",

          "body": "Depends on #26728.\r\n\r\nThis PR expands the wallet RPC `gethdkey` introduced in #26728. It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

          "body": "This PR adds a new `migratewallet` RPC which migrates a legacy wallet to a descriptor wallet. Migrated wallets will need a new backup. If a wallet has watchonly stuff in it, a new watchonly descriptor wallet will be created containing those watchonly things. The related transactions, labels, and descriptors for those watchonly things will be removed from the original wallet. Migrated wallets will not have any of the legacy things be available for fetching from `getnewaddress` or `getrawchangeaddress`. Wallets that have private keys enabled will have newly generated descriptors. Wallets with private keys disabled will not have any active `ScriptPubKeyMan`s.\r\n\r\nFor the basic HD wallet case of just generated keys, in addition to the standard descriptor wallet descriptors using the master key derived from the pre-existing hd seed, the migration will also create 3 descriptors for each HD chain in: a ranged combo external, a ranged combo internal, and a single key combo for the seed (the seed is a valid key that we can receive coins at!). The migrated wallet will then have newly generated descriptors as the active `ScriptPubKeyMan`s. This is equivalent to creating a new descriptor wallet and importing the 3 descriptors for each HD chain. For wallets containing non-HD keys, each key will have its own combo descriptor.\r\n\r\nThere are also tests.",

But, it's a bug on v24\r\n   (check [#26559](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26559)).\r\n\r\n   This method it's being fixed and not removed because I'm later using it to solve\r\n   another bug inside this PR.\r\n\r\n2) As we update the total cached amount of the `CoinsResult` object inside\r\n   `AvailableCoins` and we don't use such function inside the coin selection\r\n   tests (we manually load up the `CoinsResult` object), there is a discrepancy\r\n   between the outputs that we add/erase and the total amount cached value.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* This makes use of the `CoinsResult` total amount field to early return\r\n  with an \"Insufficient funds\" error inside Coin Selection if the tx target\r\n  amount is greater than the sum of all the wallet available coins plus the\r\n  preset inputs amounts (we don't need to perform the entire coin selection\r\n  process if we already know that there aren't enough funds inside our wallet).\r\n\r\n### Test Coverage\r\n\r\n1) Adds test coverage for the duplicated preset input selection bug that we have in v24.\r\n  Where the wallet invalidly selects the preset inputs twice during the Coin Selection\r\n  process. Which ends up with a \"good\" Coin Selection result that does not cover the\r\n  total tx target amount. Which, alone, crashes the wallet due an insane fee.\r\n  But.. to make it worst, adding the subtract fee from output functionality\r\n  to this mix ends up with the wallet by-passing the \"insane\" fee assertion,\r\n  decreasing the output amount to fulfill the insane fee, and.. sadly,\r\n  broadcasting the tx to the network.\r\n\r\n2) Adds test coverage for the `CoinsResult::Erase` method.",

          "title": "tracing: Only prepare tracepoint arguments when actually tracing",
          "body": "Currently, if the tracepoints are compiled (e.g. in depends and release builds), we always prepare the tracepoint arguments regardless of the tracepoints being used or not. We made sure that the argument preparation is as cheap as possible, but we can almost completely eliminate any overhead for users not interested in the tracepoints (the vast majority), by gating the tracepoint argument preparation with an `if(something is attached to this tracepoint)`. To achieve this, we use the optional semaphore feature provided by SystemTap.\r\n\r\nThe first commit simplifies and deduplicates our tracepoint macros from 13 TRACEx macros to a single TRACEPOINT macro. This makes them easier to use and also avoids more duplicate macro definitions in the second commit.\r\n\r\nThe Linux tracing tools I'm aware of (bcc, bpftrace, libbpf, and systemtap) all support the semaphore gating feature. Thus, all existing tracepoints and their argument preparation is gated in the second commit. For details, please refer to the commit messages and the updated documentation in `doc/tracing.md`.\r\n\r\nAlso adding unit tests that include all tracepoint macros to make sure there are no compiler problems with them (e.g. some varadiac extension not supported). \r\n\r\nReviewers might want to check:\r\n- Do the tracepoints still work for you? Do the examples in `contrib/tracing/` run on your system (as bpftrace frequently breaks on every new version, please test master too if it should't work for you)? Do the CI interface tests still pass?\r\n- Is the new documentation clear? \r\n- The `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE(event, context)` macros places global variables in our global namespace. Is this something we strictly want to avoid or maybe move to all `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE`s to a separate .cpp file or even namespace? I like having the `TRACEPOINT_SEMAPHORE()` in same file as the `TRACEPOINT()`, but open for suggestion on alternative approaches. \r\n- Are newly added tracepoints in the unit tests visible when using `readelf -n /src/test/test_bitcoin`? You can run the new unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin --run_test=util_trace_tests* --log_level=all`.\r\n<details><summary>Two of the added unit tests demonstrate that we are only processing the tracepoint arguments when attached by having a test-failure condition in the tracepoint argument preparation. The following bpftrace script can be used to demonstrate that the tests do indeed fail when attached to the tracepoints.</summary>\r\n\r\n`fail_tests.bt`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bpftrace\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/test/test_bitcoin:test:check_if_attached {\r\n  printf(\"the 'check_if_attached' test should have failed\\n\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nusdt:./src/test/test_bitcoin:test:expensive_section {\r\n  printf(\"the 'expensive_section' test should have failed\\n\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the unit tests with `./src/test/test_bitcoin` and start `bpftrace fail_tests.bt -p $(pidof test_bitcoin)` in a separate terminal. The unit tests should fail with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning 594 test cases...\r\ntest/util_trace_tests.cpp(31): error: in \"util_trace_tests/test_tracepoint_check_if_attached\": check false has failed\r\ntest/util_trace_tests.cpp(51): error: in \"util_trace_tests/test_tracepoint_manual_tracepoint_active_check\": check false has failed\r\n\r\n*** 2 failures are detected in the test module \"Bitcoin Core Test Suite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThese links might provide more contextual information for reviewers:\r\n- [How SystemTap Userspace Probes Work by eklitzke](https://eklitzke.org/how-sytemtap-userspace-probes-work) (actually an example on Bitcoin Core; mentions that with semaphores \"the overhead for an untraced process is effectively zero.\")\r\n- [libbpf comment on USDT semaphore handling](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/blob/1596a09b5de2a50ab8d44218fc29b6d42f886305/src/usdt.c#L83-L92) (can recommend the whole comment for background on how the tracepoints and tracing tools work together)\r\n- https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/UserSpaceProbeImplementation#Semaphore_Handling",

Please try sending\r\na smaller amount or manually consolidating your wallet's UTXOs\".\r\n\r\n2) If the user pre-selected inputs and disallowed the automatic coin\r\n   selection process (no other inputs are allowed), we now will\r\n   return: \r\n-> \"The preselected coins total amount does not cover the transaction\r\ntarget. Please allow other inputs to be automatically selected or include\r\nmore coins manually\".\r\n\r\n3) The double-counted preset inputs during Coin Selection error will now\r\nthrow an \"internal bug detected\" message instead of crashing the node.\r\n\r\nThe essence of this work comes from several comments:\r\n1. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26560#discussion_r1037395665\r\n2. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25729#discussion_r940619491\r\n3. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25269#pullrequestreview-1135240825\r\n4. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23144 (which is connected to #24845)",

Then\r\nperform Coin Selection to fund 49.5 BTC.\r\n\r\nAs the selection of the 1515 small UTXOs exceeds the max allowed tx size, the\r\nexpectation here is to receive a selection result that only contain the big UTXO.\r\nWhich is not happening for the following reason:\r\n\r\nKnapsack returns a result that exceeds the max allowed transaction size, when\r\nit should return the closest utxo above the target, so we fallback to SRD who\r\nselects coins randomly up until the target is met. So we end up with a selection\r\nresult with lot more coins than what is needed.",

      "body": "I was thinking if the `OutputGroups` class could be simplified somehow, right now the methods `Push` and `PushAll` seem to be a bit redundant and could be deduplicated. How about a single method like\r\n```\r\nvoid OutputGroups::Push(const OutputGroup& group, OutputType type, bool insert_positive, bool insert_mixed)\r\n{\r\n    if (group.m_outputs.empty()) return;\r\n\r\n    Groups& groups = groups_by_type[type];\t\r\n    if (insert_positive && group.GetSelectionAmount() > 0) {\r\n        groups.positive_group.emplace_back(group);\r\n        all_groups.positive_group.emplace_back(group);\r\n    }\r\n    if (insert_mixed) {\r\n        groups.mixed_group.emplace_back(group);\r\n        all_groups.mixed_group.emplace_back(group);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(This seems a bit more like the earlier version you had, but without enums and without duplication.) The methods `OutputGroups::PushAll` and `Groups::GetRef` could then simply be dropped and only the call-sites need to be adapted w.r.t. to the two boolean parameters.",

If it costs the user the same to send the grouped version, we send it (even if the user has `avoidpartialspends` set to `false` which is default). This patch ensures that the second transaction creation attempt re-uses the change destination selected by the first attempt. Otherwise, the first change address remains reserved, will not be used in the second attempt, and then will never be used by the wallet, leaving gaps in the BIP44 chain.\r\n\r\nIf the user had `avoidpartialspends` set to true, there is no second version of the created transaction and the change addresses are not affected.\r\n\r\nI believe this behavior was introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14582",

I'll think more and come back if I have some ideas. Maybe @Xekyo the master of terminology have some ideas.",

When we remove negative UTXOs we assess the whole group and not each UTXO individually, so you don't need to regroup anything after filtering negative groups.\r\n\r\nNo wait, that would leave negative UTXOs in positive-only groups if the sum of the positive UTXOs surpasses the sum of the negative ones.\r\n\r\nCurrently, a \"positive-only group\" is essentially a container who stores only positive UTXOs. Not a mix of UTXOs which values sum is positive. That is different conceptually and something that, at least for now, we are not allowing.\r\n\r\nCheck master, inside `OutputGroup::Insert` method, first line. We reject individual negative UTXOs when the container only stores positive-only UTXOs.\r\n\r\nThe only way to create positive-groups out of mixed groups is to traverse each group UTXOs set and remove the negative ones. Then, if the group has less than a 100 entries and there are other groups corresponding to the same script (after doing the same removal on those groups), the wallet need to re-order them so only full groups are provided to the selection algorithms (if the avoid partial groups flag is enabled).\r\n\r\nAside from that, performance wise, I still think that performing the negative UTXOs removal later on the process will introduce a non-negligible overhead in big wallets.",
