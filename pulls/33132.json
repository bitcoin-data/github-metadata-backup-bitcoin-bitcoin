    "body": "In the `txgraph` fuzz test, the `CommitStaging` step updates the `SimTxGraph` levels simply by erasing the front (=main) one in the `sims` vector, i.e. the staging level instance takes the place of the main level instance:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/83a2216f5278c1123ba740f1c8a055652e033ddd/src/test/fuzz/txgraph.cpp#L668-L672\r\n\r\nThis also includes the `real_is_optimal` flag (reflecting whether the corresponding real graph is known to be optimally linearized), without taking into account that this flag should only be set if _both_ levels before the commiting are optimal.\r\n\r\nE.g. in case of #33097, at this point the main level is not optimally linearized, while the staging level is, and due to the incorrect propagation of the latter the simulation incorrectly assumes that the main level is optimal after, leading to the assertion fail in the additional checks that are ran in this case[1]. Fix this by setting the flag in the resulting main level explicitly. This is done in a generic way, in case there will ever be more than two levels (not sure what is planned in this direction), a simpler alternative would be e.g. `main_optimal = sim[0].real_is_optimal && sim[1].real_is_optimal`.\r\n\r\nFixes #33097.\r\n\r\n[1] see https://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/commit/0aedf09ccc0ad4fff5956bdc012778534612c017 for the printf-debug-session-clutter, if that is useful/interesting for anyone (most of the output turned out to be irrelevant to the actual cause of #33097, but it was an entertaining way to discover the interface and get a first glimpse of `TxGraph` internals as a cluster-mempool newbie).",

This also includes the `real_is_optimal` flag\n(reflecting whether the corresponding real graph is known to be\noptimally linearized), without taking into account that this flag\nshould only be set if _both_ levels before the commiting are optimal.\n\nE.g. in case of #33097, the main level is not optimally linearized,\nwhile the staging level is, and due to the incorrect propagation of the\nlatter to the simulation incorrectly assumes that the main level is\noptimal, leading to the assertion fail. Fix this by setting the flag\nin the resulting main level explicitly.\n\nResolves the fuzzing assertion fail in issue #33097.",

I suppose a concrete scenario (edited for more clarity):\r\n1. we have main and staging, neither optimally linearized. there are some non-optimal clusters that haven't been pulled from main to staging (this is the case in the real TxGraph, though the sim has a full copy)\r\n2. we create an observer for the main level (alternatively, it could be oversized)\r\n3. we call DoWork() which returns true after optimally linearizing the staging level and skipping the main level\r\n4. we delete the main level observer\r\n5. we call CommitStaging. sims staging gets copied over.\r\n6. in the real `TxGraph`, while some clusters are optimal (the ones that changed in staging), others aren't",
