      "body": "@MarcoFalke \r\n\r\nI think we should use both. While both tools try to find uses of uninitialized memory (UUM) they are implemented in totally different ways: Valgrind's memcheck is using binary translation while MSan is using compiler-based instrumentation. ~~From my experience it is not guaranteed that Valgrind finds all issues reported by MSan and vice versa.~~\r\n\r\nFurthermore, having the combination libFuzzer+MSan readily available is really crucial when fuzzing. The combination libFuzzer+Valgrind is only usable for testing against an existing fuzzing corpus like we do in Travis -- not for doing any actual fuzzing. For the libFuzzer+MSan combination to be available it is important to have the cumbersome MSan setup process documented and also kept up-to-date and working over time. We get that for free by having an MSan build in Travis.\r\n\r\nAlso MSan is order of magnitudes faster than Valgrind which means that we can run also tests that are too slow for Valgrind in Travis.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least MSan can report the name of the variable that has not been initialized (thanks to MSan using compiler-based instrumentation). Valgrind only points to the function name.\r\n\r\nIn summary: I think having MSan in Travis is a very clear win. Let's use all available tools to try to kill the uninitialized memory (UUM) bug class :)\r\n\r\nLet me know if you can think of any problems that could arise from testing also under MSan in Travis.",

Until I can provide an example we can simplify the discussion by assuming that I was flat out wrong about the possibility of Valgrind not catching an issue found by MSan (given enough runtime to compensate for being orders of magnitude slower than MSan).\r\n\r\nFrom a practical perspective the main reason to start using MSan is the speedup that will allow us to go from detecting use of uninitialized memory in code covered by a single(!) functional test (`p2p_segwit.py`) to detecting use of uninitialized memory in *all* code covered by our functional tests.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I'm not suggesting removing the Valgrind job: I think we should use both and ideally bump the timeouts so that Valgrind can test a couple of more functional tests at least :)\r\n\r\n(Just to be clear: I love **both** Valgrind (proof of love: #18166, #18162, #18159, #17633, #17640, #17624, #17455, #15117, #11035, #11024, #10977) and MSan – I use them daily :))\r\n\r\nLet me know if you can think of any problems that could arise from testing also under MSan in Travis.",

The question was primarily driven out of my own curiosity. \r\n\r\nFaster can be pretty useful, though I've found msan in the past to be somewhat lacking compared to valgrind in terms of sensitivity -- though my experience is mostly from when msan was very new. I've found msan most useful in the context of fuzzing, where any speed difference makes for a meaningful throughput difference which ultimately results in a sensitivity difference.\r\n\r\nThe fact that even paid travis is so cpu starved that this is a big issue for just CI tests is something of is own problem-- labour is expensive, insight is rare. CPU time is the one resource needed by the project which should never be the limiting ingredient, this matters because a surplus of CPU time can be a force multiplier for human labour (though my idea of 'reasonable amounts of computing power' starts at about a [thousand core ghz](https://people.xiph.org/~greg/temp/kindatidy.jpg) per person, and I've always found it really weird how software people who are at the top of their field often work from just a single underpowered laptop; so maybe I'm just a weirdo). FWIW, for a number of years I tested every release of bitcoin in valgrind, including doing IBDs (overnight). \r\n\r\nI don't see any problem with making more use of msan, though it's not a complete replacement for valgrind. But more is more. :)\r\n",

The changes are contained to their own machine, except:\r\n* boost depends tweak that's now moved to  #18308\r\n* MSAN handling in `GetOSRand`, which is a more surgical alternative to #17627  \r\n\r\n> For the libFuzzer+MSan combination to be available it is important to have the cumbersome MSan setup process documented and also kept up-to-date and working over time. We get that for free by having an MSan build in Travis.\r\n\r\nKeeping this up to date, by having it run on Travis, seems useful. We can always triage Travis resources if funding runs dry.\r\n\r\nThe build took 1 hours and 15 minutes the first time. You could push a trivial commit to see much of that is shaved off by the cache.\r\n\r\nSlow Travis builds can be a burden on review, because Github won't show a build as failed until all Travis machines _of the current phase_ are done. I often find myself reviewing PRs in EU morning with trivial bugs not spotted by US devs before they went to be.\r\n\r\nThis can be mitigated if you add a new stage `grind`(?) and move the machine there. (I also agree with @gmaxwell about developers not using enough tooling, guilty as charged)\r\n\r\nIt could also run as part of a cron job on master (`\"$TRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE\" = \"cron\"`), but I'm not sure who gets notified when those fail. And it's better to catch stuff before merge, so let's not do that unless we run short on resources.",

That might sound long but it is still 45 minutes quicker than the current `valgrind` job which only covers a subset of the functional tests whereas this one covers all of them :)\r\n\r\n(To be clear: even with the two hour `valgrind` job I think it easily is worth taking that cost in terms of Travis build time to protect our users from at least a subset of UUM bugs. This kind of (partial) protection is long-overdue :))",

Note that we already have a valgrind ci run.\r\n\r\nAre you sure the claim \"valgrind is a strict subset of MSAN\" holds also in the presence of compiler optimisations?\r\n\r\nSee the well-documented optimisation issues in the Valgrind documentation:\r\n\r\n_\"If you are planning to use Memcheck: On rare occasions, compiler optimisations (at -O2 and above, and sometimes -O1) have been observed to generate code which fools Memcheck into wrongly reporting uninitialised value errors, or **missing uninitialised value errors**.\"_\r\n\r\n_\"We have looked in detail into fixing this, and unfortunately the result is that doing so would give a further significant slowdown in what is already a slow tool. So the best solution is to turn off optimisation altogether. Since this often makes things unmanageably slow, a reasonable compromise is to use -O. This gets you the majority of the benefits of higher optimisation levels whilst keeping relatively small the chances of false positives or false negatives from Memcheck. Also, you should compile your code with -Wall because it can identify some or all of the problems that Valgrind can miss at the higher optimisation levels. (Using -Wall is also a good idea in general.)\"_\r\n\r\n#18785 appears to be a real-world example of this issue in our project.\r\n\r\nAlso note that MSAN is so much faster than Valgrind that it allows testing at lower optimization levels that would be practically impossible with Valgrind :)\r\n\r\nAnother reason to enable MSAN is that it allows for testing forks (we are currently disabling Valgrind in forks due to timeouts).\r\n\r\nI hope we can enable MSAN in Travis: that would improve our testing without any major downside AFAICT :)",
