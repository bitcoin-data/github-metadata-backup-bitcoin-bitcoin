    "body": "If the user runs: `bitcoind -connect=X -seednode=Y`, I _think_ it is safe to ignore `-seednode`. A more populated `addrman` (via `getaddr` calls to peers in `-seednode`) is not useful in this configuration: `addrman` entries are used to initiate new outbound connections when slots are open, or to open feeler connections and keep `addrman` from getting stale. This is all done in a part of `ThreadOpenConnections` (below [this line](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net.cpp#L1803)) which is never executed when `-connect` is supplied. With `-connect`, `ThreadOpenConnections` will run [this loop](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net.cpp#L1785) and exit thread execution when interrupted.\r\n\r\nReviewers may also find it relevant that when `-connect` is used, we [soft disable](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init.cpp#L800) `-dnsseed` in init.cpp perhaps for the same reason i.e. seeding is not useful with `-connect`.\r\n\r\nRunning `ProcessAddrFetch` does not seem to have downside except developer confusion AFAICT. I was confused by this and felt it might affect other new bitcoiners too. If there is strong preference to not remove the line, I'd also be happy to just leave a comment there mentioning `ADDR_FETCH`/`-seednode` is irrelevant when used with `-connect`.\r\n\r\nIf this change is accepted, the node will still make `getaddr` calls to peers in `-connect` and expand `addrman`. However, disabling those `getaddr` calls would leak information about the node's configuration.",

      "body": "Great question, @robot-dreams!\r\n\r\nWith `-connect=X -dnsseed=1`, `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` uses some domains owned by contributors (see `CMainParams`) to expand the peers in `addrman`. If `-proxy` is set, or if a seed domain does not support `x9.domain` (which tests for `NODE_NETWORK | NODE_WITNESS`), `getaddr` calls are made to a peer dns seed resolves to. i.e. `ADDR_FETCH` connections to an address that a dees like `dnsseed.emzy.de` resolves to. Otherwise (and this is mostly the case), DNS _resolved_ addresses are used as peer candidates in `addrman`. So, sometimes, DNS seeds act as seednodes (eg. in `-proxy` mode) requiring a further `getaddr` call (this case is affected by removing the `ProcessAddrFetch()` call), but mostly, they directly dns resolve to peers which support `NODE_NETWORK | NODE_WITNESS` (this case is unaffected).\r\n\r\n> if someone manually sets -dnsseed, so that the SoftSetBoolArg doesn't do anything, is it also worth printing a warning in that case?\r\n\r\nYes, I think it's worth adding a warning for the case: `-connect=X -dnsseed=1 -proxy=Y`. I've added it.\r\n\r\nRebased with master.",

It is just supposed to enforce internal consistency and prevent bugs by ensuring that list arguments are always retrieved with GetArgs() and non-list arguments are always retrieved with GetArg(). Followup PRs could use the ALLOW_LIST flags for better documentation and error checking in the future. For example, #17493 builds on this to disallow conflicting config values. \r\n\r\nThis change was originally made as part of #17493",

Just one of them should be merged._\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nListening for incoming connections in I2P does not involve a port - we just listen on an address. Similarly we just connect to an I2P address, without a port (this is in I2P SAM 3.1, what's used in Bitcoin Core).\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nIt is possible to connect to the same node multiple times if different ports are used.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nFor I2P addresses:\r\n\r\n* Ignore ports when comparing `CService` objects\r\n* Do not print ports in `CService::ToString()`\r\n* Strip ports from user-input addresses - this helps to detect duplicates earlier (by `CConnMan::FindNode(std::string)`) and to print without the ports in the cases where we print the user input without converting it to `CService` object and using its `ToString()` method\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21389",

          "body": "This proposes two things:\r\n\r\n1. Make AddrFetch connections to fixed seeds instead of just adding them to AddrMan (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25678#issuecomment-1210858925)\r\nWhen adding fixed seeds, we currently add them to AddrMan and then make regular full outbound connections to them. If many new nodes use the fixed seeds for this, it will result in them getting a lot of peers requiring IBD, which will create a lot of traffic for them. With an AddrFetch connection, we will only use them to get addresses from other peers and disconnect afterwards.\r\nThis PR proposes to attempt making AddrFetch connections to 10 peers for better diversity (some may be offline anyway). The fixed seeds will still be added to Addrman as before, but only after a delay of 2 minutes, after which they will hopefully no longer be the only entries in AddrMan.\r\n\r\n2. Move the logic of adding fixed seeds out of `ThreadOpenConnections` into `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` (which is being renamed to `ThreadAddressSeed`).\r\nI think this makes sense in general because adding the fixed seeds is in many ways analogous to querying the DNS seeds, and ThreadOpenConnections, which is there to actually open the connections is already quite complex.\r\nAlso, it makes the changes from 1) easier if we don't have to worry about interfering with the automatic connection making logic.\r\n\r\nOne way to test this is to start without `peers.dat` and run with `-nodnsseed -blocksonly -debug=net` and monitor the debug log and `bitcoin-cli -netinfo` behavior.",

I thought about this, but then realized that this would mean the node we are `-connect`ed to will be able to fingerprint that's our configuration and make it clear that we are vulnerable to eclipse attacks. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nOops, missed this. I agree, fingerprinting is another good reason. I think in practice we'd often trust the node we `-connect` to more than a random peer, and if this is our only connection to the network, the peer could guess this anyway by the lack of transactions / blocks /addresses we advertise to them.\r\nIn general, it is probably not worth optimizing `-connect` mode too much by adding conditionals at various spots in `net_processing` just to save a few bytes of bandwidth or memory here and there, because it's a rather special-purpose way of running a node used only in rare occasions.\r\n\r\n",

This improves the performance of the migrated wallet as it will only have one DescriptorSPKM for all of the non-HD keys.\r\n\r\nNote that this does not affect previously migrated wallets. Such wallets will still have a `combo()` for every key.",

      "body": "@jonatack Thank you for being so thorough! I learnt a lot here.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I didn't do was \r\n\r\n> use empty array for unneeded expected messages\r\n\r\nbecause looking at [this code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/test_framework/test_node.py#L388), I think that `assert_debug_log` would return too soon and not actually verify that the unexpected msgs are _not_ logged unless I also give it an expected message that would log _after_ the unexpected message. The underlying issue is how can the assert know that something did _not_ happen for sure? It either has to wait until the timeout, or until something that we are sure will happen after the unexpected thing _might_. \r\n\r\nAm I missing something?",

      "body": "> If `-proxy` is set, or if a seed domain does not support `x9.domain` (which tests for `NODE_NETWORK | NODE_WITNESS`), `getaddr` calls are made to the dns seed itself as a peer. i.e. `ADDR_FETCH` connections to an address like `dnsseed.emzy.de`.\r\n\r\nI used to think the same, but @sipa explained to me that this is not what's happening: We don't make a `ADDR_FETCH` connection to a node run by the DNS seed, in fact the DNS seed operator does not even need to run a reachable bitcoind node. Instead, we connect to the peer that the DNS seed currently resolves to - which is basically just a random node on the network not under the control of the DNS seed operator, and it changes every once in a while (~30minutes?) for a given DNS seed.\r\nSince this is a common misconception, I think it would be good to describe it not just here in the test code, but also in `net` (If you'd prefer not to do it here, I could open a PR).",
