    "body": "edit 0: Updated to reflect updates mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10145#issuecomment-291632820\r\n\r\nThis PR separates ProcessMessage into two functions, ContextualProcessMessage and ~ProcessMessage~ _Process*Message_. This helps with readability, verifiability, and maintainability of the code.\r\n\r\nContextualProcessMessage generates a list of context dependent \"whitelists\", all of which must pass for the incoming message before a call to ProcessMessage may be made. If the whitelists fail, the code that follows should be identical to the previous behavior. The choice of whitelists over blacklists is because it is better to explicitly enable the behaviors desired, rather than to try to block the potential bad features (e.g., adding something unsafe and new won't be permitted in unstudied contexts). This design should be extensible for adding new features (~up to 64 netmsgs total~ unlimited network messages) as well as new contexts (easy to add new whitelists). There should be very little overhead to check these whitelists as it is all ~bitwise~ _bool array lookups_.\r\n\r\n~ProcessMessage now uses an enum to switch to~ _Dispatch is now done using a std::map lookup to get_ the appropriate handler, and is semi \"stateless\" _(the map is const)_. This makes it easier to verify the code and make dispatch more modular.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't benchmarked that the conversion from string->~enum~_std::pair<handler_t, whitelist_index>_ has any performance implication, negative or positive. In theory this code could be faster given fewer branch mispredictions due to the ~switch~_function pointer call_. Another PR could improve the lookup algorithm ~(trivially, inlining getAllNetMessageTypes might help the compiler a lot)~, but unless it is exotic it should be compatible with this design _by replacing the map with the desired scheme_. ~I didn't think there was something obviously faster than the linear lookup, because n is small.~ _A std::map lookup should be fairly fast, but perhaps a custom map could be faster._\r\n\r\n~The correctness of this code is dependent on NetMsgTypeEnum::tag and allNetMessageTypes having the same index order. It would be nice to verify this property at compile time, which should be possible with some recursive constexpr static_assert magic. The default return of ProcessNewMessage is now also false, because the last return is unreachable.~\r\n\r\nSee #9608 and https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/f1e4e281e3f1eb884f8010ac941c82752174bdbe for related work/alternatives.",

I agree that having preconditions closer to the code can be good; but it's also good to have a non-exposed function which only takes sanitized inputs, and do the sanitizing elsewhere. I agree with the state machine comment, but that was the existing state of the code: there is currently an implicit state machine on what order messages were allowed to come in. This PR makes it more explicit; if you want to make it even more explicit (e.g., ProtocolStateMachine class I think that would be great :)). This at least makes it really easy to do whatever you want with the actual dispatch as it is state independent.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's more maintainable to have repeated preconditions throughout the code, because then it is easier to forget to check a precondition in a handler and you repeat precondition checking code, leading to more opportunity for error. It's a trade off.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to re-check these preconditions if critical, which would maybe be \"the best/worst\" of both worlds.",

It reduces flexibility.\r\n\r\nUnless it can be clearly shown from performance results that matching a small string in e.g. a sorted table or run-time constructed hash is really a performance sink, and given the small number of small messages I would be really surprised (12 bytes isn't even two 64-bit words!), I'd prefer if adding a message type was just adding a line. \r\n\r\n> ProtocolStateMachine \r\n\r\nIf you go this way, I don't think there should be one protocol state machine. Different concerns (e.g. initial negotiation, handling pings, handling transactions, handling blocks, handling filters) could be separate state machines that handle groups of messages (this was @sipa's idea). Creating a separate handler class for every message type would be typical OOP overkill, but for separate concerns I think it'd make sense and would help untangle the current labyrinth.",

Individual handlers that rely on global preconditions should also re-check these global preconditions to harden them against a failure in ContextualProcessMessage.\r\n\r\nI pushed up a better version. \r\n\r\nMore Modular:\r\n  - there is no external dependency on the value of message types in the enum\r\n  - Each handler is a separate function (this duplicates/replaces some of @jtimon's work)\r\n\r\nCleaner:\r\n  - The whitelists are now a std::array<bool, ...> rather than (previously) a uint64_t, so no masking just indexing\r\n  - Identifiers are renamed to be a bit more clear\r\n  - whitelists are now separated into global and connection specific\r\n  - diff is easier to read\r\n\r\nMore Extensible:\r\n  - The whitelists are now a std::array<bool, ...> rather than (previously) a uint64_t, so no refactoring needed to have more than 64 messages. Adding new whitelists is also easier/cleaner.\r\n  - The use of the function pointers/whitelist arrays makes future work easier, including having per-node handler tables/whitelists (e.g., if a client says it is SPV disable certain operations).\r\n\r\n\r\nold version exists at https://github.com/jeremyrubin/bitcoin/tree/netprocessing_enum_backup for reference.\r\n",

In contrast, it seems like this PR would make harder for me to read at a glance (or maybe not, or maybe it is still worth it, I honestly don't know). Although I've written #9608 (which as said is trivial to write IMO, just a little bit painful [could have been lesss painful if I still used eclipse http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2FgettingStarted%2Fqs-ExtractMethod.htm ]), I don't feel very capacitated to review this PR or even https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/f1e4e281e3f1eb884f8010ac941c82752174bdbe which looks much simpler.\r\n",

Will spend more time when there are concept acks for the overall approach.\r\n\r\nI think this is a nice improvement. The logic and explanations in ContextProcessMessage make it easier to understand why various checks are being done. The centralized whitelists should make it easier to add new message types with correct checking in the future because you can see at a glance how all the existing message types behave. The separate message handling functions make code more navigable.",

I think verifying correctness of changes to the processing logic is more complicated under #9608. I'd love to understand what other future considerations you're making though.\r\n\r\nBecause of all of the pesky interactions with our own state, we can only go so far in laying out the rules up-front.\r\n\r\nFor example, someone could be forgiven for assuming (based on the whitelist here) that INVs are processed while importing/reindexing, though in reality, there's only a tiny wallet interaction.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, IsInitialBlockDownload() isn't handled by the dispatcher, leaving it up to individual messages to decide. And that's as it should be, because each message will have their own criteria for that.\r\n\r\nSo if the rules can't be completely enumerated, we're only spreading them out and adding more places to check (or miss). The current behavior (and that of #9608) is to only check for proper handshake behavior outside of individual message parsing. That basically boils down to:\r\n```c++\r\nif (!node->nVersion && strCommand != NetMsgType::VERSION) return;\r\nelse if (!node->fSuccessfullyConnected && strCommand != NetMsgType::VERACK) return;\r\nDispatch(strCommand);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI might be convinced that a slimmed-down version of this that only performed ^^ checks before dispatching would be reasonable.",

In the past there were attempts to clarify the control flow in `ProcessMessage()` by moving each case into a separate static function (see #9608). It was closed because it wasn't clear if moving each case into a function was the right approach.\r\nThough, we can quasi treat each case as a function by adding a return statement to each case. (Can be seen as a continuation of bugfix #13162)\r\n\r\nThis patch does exactly that.\r\n\r\nAlso note that this patch is a subset of previous approaches such as #9608 and #10145.\r\n\r\nReview suggestion: `git diff HEAD~ --function-context`",

And you could replace handler_registry table with initialization from a flat list of handler classes.\r\n\r\nI could imagine other reviewers liking functions more than classes though, and the differences are pretty superficial, so should just consider this a tentative suggestion.",
