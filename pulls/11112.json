(for all but arrays, this only works for const containers to prevent surprises).\r\n\r\nAnd then make use of those improvements in various call sites.\r\n\r\nI realize the template magic used looks scary, but it's only needed to make overload resultion make the right choices. Note that the operations done on values are all extremely simple: no casts, explicit conversions, or warning-silencing constructions. That should hopefully make it simpler to review.",
