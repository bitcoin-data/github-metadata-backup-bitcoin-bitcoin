    "body": "See #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nDelving Bitcoin discussion thread: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/v3-transaction-policy-for-anti-pinning/340\r\nDelving Bitcoin discussion for LN usage: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/lightning-transactions-with-v3-and-ephemeral-anchors/418\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- There are various pinning problems with RBF and our general ancestor/descendant limits. These policies help mitigate many pinning attacks and make package RBF feasible (see #28984 which implements package RBF on top of this). I would focus the most here on Rule 3 pinning. [1][2]\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see #27677 and #28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n\r\nV3 policy is for \"Priority Transactions.\" [3][4] It allows users to opt in to more restrictive topological limits for shared transactions, in exchange for the more robust fee-bumping abilities that offers. Even though we don't have cluster limits, we are able to treat these transactions as having as having a maximum cluster size of 2.\r\n\r\nImmediate benefits:\r\n\r\n- You can presign a transaction with 0 fees (not just 1sat/vB!) and add a fee-bump later.\r\n- Rule 3 pinning is reduced by a significant amount, since the attacker can only attach a maximum of 1000vB to your shared transaction.\r\n \r\nThis also enables some other cool things (again see #27463 for overall roadmap):\r\n- Ephemeral Anchors\r\n- Package RBF for these 1-parent-1-child packages. That means e.g. a commitment tx + child can replace another commitment tx using the child's fees.\r\n- We can transition to a \"single anchor\" universe without worrying about package limit pinning. So current users of CPFP carve out would have something else to use.\r\n- We can switch to a cluster-based mempool [5] (#27677 #28676), which removes CPFP carve out [6].\r\n\r\n[1]: Original mailing list post and discussion about RBF pinning problems https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff, https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html\r\n[2]: A FAQ is \"we need this for cluster mempool, but is this still necessary afterwards?\" There are some pinning issues that are fixed here and not fully fixed in cluster mempool, so we will still want this or something similar afterward.\r\n[3]: Mailing list post for v3 https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html\r\n[4]: Original PR #25038 also contains a lot of the discussion\r\n[5]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393/7\r\n[6]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393#the-cpfp-carveout-rule-can-no-longer-be-supported-12",

          "title": "policy: nVersion=3 and Package RBF",
          "body": "**Note: this PR has been superseded by #28948 (v3) and #28984 (package RBF)**\r\n\r\nSee #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A set of policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. Namely, it allows users to opt in to more restrictive descendant limits for shared transactions. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying.\r\n\r\nFAQ: is v3 still helpful even with cluster mempool (#27677) ?\r\n\r\n- Rule 3 pinning: This is addressed with v3 but not really with cluster mempool (descendant allowance is still too permissive).\r\n- Package RBF and ACP pinning: This PR allows for package RBF with v3 packages. V3 has an effective \"cluster limit\" of 2 which makes it very cheap to calculate the mining score of a v3 transaction. With cluster mempool, which also makes it easier to calculate mining score, we could have package RBF for non-v3 transactions.\r\n- Allowing 0fee transactions: This PR allows v3 transactions to be below minimum relay feerate, provided they are CPFP'd. This is because the simplified topology allows us to avoid situations like the ones described in #26933. With cluster mempool, we can allow this for non-v3 transactions.",

          "body": "Currently the mempool returns and consumes sets of multiindex iterators in its public API. A likely motivation for this over working with references to the actual values is that the multi index interface works with these iterators and not with pointers or references to the actual values.\r\n\r\nHowever, using the iterator type in the `setEntries` set provides little benefit in practice as applied currently. Its purpose, ownership, and safety semantics often remain ambiguous, and it is hardly used for actually iterating through the data structures. So replace it where possible with `CTxMemPoolEntryRef`s.\r\n\r\nSince `CTxMemPoolEntry` itself refers to its Parents and Children by `CTxMemPoolEntryRef` and not `txiter`, this allowed for an overall reduction of calls to `iterator_to`. See the [docs](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_83_0/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial/indices.html#iterator_to) on `iterator_to` for more guidance.\r\n\r\nNo change in the performance of the mempool code was observed in my benchmarks.\r\n\r\nThis also makes the goal of eliminating boost types from the headers as done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28335 more feasible.\r\n",

          "title": "RFC: Remove boost usage from kernel api / headers",
          "body": "Similarly to #28327 I wanted to open this PR to receive some opinions and better approaches.\r\n\r\nThe kernel library is currently at the stage where unwanted headers are removed from its set of headers. In practice, this means we are reducing the number of includes that are required for compiling the experimental `bitcoin-chainstate` binary. This is described in stage 1 step 3 of the [project tracking issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).\r\n\r\nCurrently the mempool is part of the kernel library. The mempool headers include the boost multi index headers. Thus any application wanting to use the kernel library and its headers will have to include the boost headers too. This is not only undesirable because of the sheer size of these headers, but also might lead to conflicts if the including application uses a different boost version.\r\n\r\nIn the approach laid out by this PR, mempool member variables and methods are declared in the header without having to include boost by either wrapping them in a struct and [pimpling](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) them, or making methods static implementation functions. The boost definitions are gathered into separate header (`mempool_set_definitions.h`) that is only included by implementation files that require definitions of the boost types. This allows us to retain the current architecture with roughly the same interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe approach laid out by this PR also has some, albeit small, compilation speed and size benefits. Averaged over a few of compilation runs I consistently observe faster compilation by a couple of seconds and some smaller pre-processed and compiled object sizes. The main detractor of this method is obviously the number of lines touched. However it also has the benefit of inventorizing all the files that require direct access to the mempool data structures as well getting rid of boost multi index includes in non-kernel implementation files that include the mempool, but don't directly manipulate its data structures (e.g. wallet.cpp).\r\n\r\nA much simpler alternative approach, at least on the surface, would be removing all `txmempool.h` includes from kernel library headers (see [this branch](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/mempoolBoostSimple)). Currently this is only `validation.h`.  Due to the mutex member of `CTxMemPool` and the correspondingly defined lock decorators on the chainstate methods this becomes a bit more complicated though and I am not sure how this might be possible with the current architecture.\r\n\r\nA discussion of how and if to remove the mempool from the kernel library has so far been intentionally punted to the next stage of the kernel library development. Pimpling the mempool itself precludes this discussion, since the library could never be shipped with the `CTxMemPool` headers. Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.",

What matters is the overall weight limit of the package (4000 WU for a child), as this limit draws an anti-pinning security bound on the lowest off-chain payment that one can afford to burn as an absolute fee . Limit to be evaluated in function of network mempools congestion. Removing the absolute fee replacement rules I think would simplify current pinning analysis - though sounds this is beyond the scope of this proposal.",

This could be useful in the future for using or testing these classes without having to instantiate any form of signal handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587). It improves the kernel API and removes two modules from the kernel library.",

If larger, fail.\r\n3) The package rbf may not evict more than 100 transactions from the mempool(bip125 rule 5)\r\n4) The package's child tx has greater feerate than the parent tx (otherwise the parent should have RBF'd on its own at step 0)\r\n5) Every directly conflicted mempool transaction is connected to at most 1 other in-mempool transaction (ie the cluster size of the conflict is at most 2).\r\n6) Diagram check: We ensure that the replacement is strictly superior at all points, improving the mempool (which includes bip125 rule 3)\r\n7) The total fee of the package, minus the total fee of what is being evicted, is at least the minrelayfee * size of the package (equivalent to bip125 rule 3 and 4)\r\n\r\nPost-cluster mempool this will likely be expanded to general package rbf, but this is what we can safely support today.\r\n",

One could add significant computing payload on its mining competitors by throwing buffy packages with 0 fees parent and then replace the high-fee child (in a cycle). A more robust approach can be to let those 0 fees parent sleep in the local non-full mempool, and only evict them when you have non-0 fees transactions showing up. The asymmetry between the additional computational cost to flush out automatically and the rbf penalty paid sounds to be at the advantage of a potential denial-of-service attacker (edited).",

          "title": "[WIP] Cluster mempool implementation",
          "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [ ] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick)\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add mempool transactions in a topologically-invalid way.\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts. Is this a problem?",

Rule 3 Absolute fee pinning.\r\n2. Rule 5 pinning vector.\r\n\r\n\r\n~I looked at the proposal of cluster mempool the v3 proposals but fail to understand how the addition of cluster mempool might revert the pinning vectors solved by this new policy rules specifically of the above pinning issues.  ~\r\nEdit thanks to @instagibbs for insights\r\n\r\nI believe what you meant is that certain pinning attacks, such as rule 3 pinning, aren't resolved by introducing a cluster mempool.\r\n\r\nTo address rule 3 pinning post cluster mempool, we'll need policy rules similar to the ones in the current v3 transactions policy. For instance, enforcing a cluster size limit of two transactions, and the child size restriction.\r\n\r\nBecause cluster mempool will require these policy rules in the future as such cluster mempool and v3 transactions do not conflict with one another, after v3 transaction policy is added cluster mempool will just likely fit in.\r\n\r\nPost v3, rule 3 and rule 5 pinning are eliminated. If a cluster mempool is added after v3 transactions, the cluster limit remains at 2. This means rule 3 is still eliminated, and with a cluster limit of 2, we won't encounter rule 5 package limit pinning during package rbf of lightning commitment transactions since we are rbfing a single cluster of size two.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewed to b39cdfbd4c88adc2060841f49a6caaf7e5202c82 so far.\r\n",

          "body": "This was suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1412320818.\r\n\r\n**The Problem**\r\nPackage CPFP (only accessible through regtest-only RPC submitpackage) allows 0-fee (or otherwise below min relay feerate) transactions if they are bumped by a child. We need to know what to do with these transactions if they lose their sponsor, e.g. due to a replacement that removed the input spending this 0-fee transaction.\r\n\r\nThis is made slightly more complicated by the fact that our \"selection scoring\" (BlockAssembler) is different from our \"eviction scoring.\" Roughly, we select based on ancestor feerate and evict based on descendant feerate. This may lead to [evicting things we would actually want to mine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27018#issuecomment-1424742766) and [not evicting things that we will never mine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1400143991).\r\n\r\nThis PR's approach is to remove the 1sat/vB `-blockmintxfee` and have BlockAssembler select anything in the mempool (still based on ancestor packages, but not stopping at 1sat/vB). It also adds logic to `TrimToSize()` to evict anything paying <=0 fees. The idea is, if we're getting to the bottom of our mempool, we scrape up all the sats we can. Anything that pays *some* fee is worth adding to the block template.\r\n\r\nA major advantage of this approach is that 0-fee, non-v3 transactions can be bumped in package CPFP.\r\n\r\nA few observations which may or may not be problematic:\r\n- This increases the potential work after a reorg, since we add an extra step of removing the below-minrelayfeerate entries.\r\n- This increases the number of transactions that may be evicted in a replacement (from the worst case scenario we discussed before, it's up to 2500 entries).\r\n- This means you can remove a transaction from your own mempool by calling prioritisetransaction with a negative value.\r\n",

Relaying 1-parent-1-child CPFP when mempool min feerate is high would be a subset of the use cases, but a pretty significant improvement over what we have today.\r\n- Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n- The majority of this code is useful for building e.g. #27742.\r\n\r\nThis means 1p1c packages propagate in the \"happy case\" where nobody is deliberately withholding packages.\r\n\r\nTo make this more robust, we need receiver-side logic to retry orphan resolution with multiple peers. Also, since we rely on the orphanage to remember the child while waiting for the parent, peers may cause us to drop packages by sending lots of orphans. To make this robust, we need to make efforts to protect some amount of orphans from eviction.\r\n\r\n[1]: see this writeup and its links https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/02ec218c7857ef60914e9a3d383b68caf987f70b/bip-0331.mediawiki#propagate-high-feerate-transactions",

[v3 does not fix all pinning vectors](https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review#v3-transactions);\r\n2. Using CPFP is [less optimal than using RBF](https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review#replace-by-fee);\r\n3. [\"Anchor Outputs Are a Danger to Mining Decentralization\"](https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review#anchor-outputs-are-a-danger-to-mining-decentralization) :tm:\r\n\r\nIf we tune down the sensational part of the third point to \"a non-incentive compatible relay policy is bad for mining decentralization\" then all these 3 points are trivially true statements. Only, the conclusion of the blog post that \"V3 transactions should not be be shipped at the moment\" does not follow from these.\r\n\r\n## v3 does not fix all pinning vectors\r\n\r\nv3 aims to fix what's commonly referred to as \"[Rule 3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/policy/mempool-replacements.md) pinning\". That is, currently an attacker can make their victim pay up to 500x the required fees to replace an attacker's low feerate transaction (more [here](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/117747/101498)). By limiting the size of child of unconfirmed transactions from the current `100,000` to `1000` vbytes the \"v3\" proposal effectively decreases the harm of performing this attack by a 100x factor. It's well known this still leaves room for an attacker to increase the fees paid by their victim by at most a 5x factor. For instance, [the motivations section of the ephemeral anchors BIP](https://github.com/instagibbs/bips/blob/ephemeral_anchor/bip-ephemeralanchors.mediawiki#motivation) touches on this:\r\n> v3 transactions, which this proposal is built on, greatly mitigates [RBF] pinning vectors, where an adversary can vastly increase the required fees to replace a transaction that will not be mined quickly, or disallow replacement altogether. Depending on certain factors, this economic value can reach over 500 times increase in required fees to replace the attacker's transaction. V3 transactions end up reducing this attack surface by 100 times, resulting in 5 times increase in fees using the same running example.\r\n\r\nIn his post Peter explains how an attacker can make their channel partner pay 1.5x the fees necessary for inclusion of their commitment transaction in a block. Sure, it's known already: v3 *mitigates* this, it doesn't solve it. It's also disingenuous to point out the remaining 1.5x factor left under v3 without putting it in perspective to the 100x improvement v3 brings.\r\n\r\nThe v3 relay regime isn't perfect, it's just 100x better for this application than the current one. This is not a reason not to do v3.\r\n\r\n## Using CPFP is less optimal than using RBF\r\n\r\nSure. But making RBF actually incentive compatible is a much larger undertaking (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677) than proposing a new opt-in relay regime with more constrained rules. v3 already helps closing a number of pinning vectors without having to first fix RBF.\r\n\r\nThe whole point of fee-bumping is to not have to rely on previously-agreed-upon feerates, because you can't predict what the next block feerate will be by the time you *need* to broadcast your transaction. At the moment, it's not possible in an adversarial scenario to solely rely on RBF for this. One *has* to use CPFP (along with the carve-out).\r\n\r\nTo avoid the use of CPFP Peter suggests in his blog post to get rid of this requirement and instead pre-sign a bunch of commitment + HTLC transactions in advance. This is [less crazy](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-October/004175.html) than it sounds at first, but it does mean you are back to have to guess a feerate in advance above which your channel won't be enforceable.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear that it's a valid reason not to ship v3, which does not make this compromise.\r\n\r\n## \"Danger to decentralization\"\r\n\r\nThe post then goes on to explain how using the more expensive CPFP instead of the more efficient (but at the moment not incentive compatible) RBF is a \"threat to mining decentralization\" because it incentivizes Lightning users and big miners to cut an out-of-band deal. (Miner only includes the parent, gets paid out of band: cheaper for the Lightning user, more room to include other transactions in place of the child for the miner.)\r\n\r\nThis is extremely misleading. Because it's true, but the blame is incorrectly assigned to the v3 proposal. Truth is: it's the status quo which provides an enormous incentive to cut out-of-band deals with miners. Not only because such tiny optimisations are already possible, but especially because of pinning vectors! If anything, the status quo is more a *handwave handwave* \"threat to mining decentralization\" than a post v3 world.\r\n\r\nBy closing some pinning vectors, v3 is actually reducing the incentive for Lightning users to reach out to big miners directly. Therefore, this is not a reason not to ship v3. Rather the opposite.",

It depends \"what for\" and \"compared to what\".\r\n\r\nI'm not claiming that your proposal to pre-sign a bunch of transactions at different feerates is not incentive-compatible, just that it conveniently ignores one of the requirements which v3 fulfills: that you don't have to choose a feerate in advance above which your channel isn't enforceable. There are other cases where the current RBF rules would not be incentive compatible. [For instance when another party can attach inputs to your transaction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23121#issuecomment-929475999) (`ANYONECANPAY`, `ANYPREVOUT`).\r\n\r\n> Are you claiming that the anchor outputs in existing Lightning anchor channels are subject to transaction pinning?\r\n\r\nNo, but that's only because of the Lightning-specific CPFP carve-out. See also the second point of OP:\r\n> Switching to a cluster-based mempool (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28676) requires the removal of CPFP carve out, which applications depend on. V3 + package RBF + ephemeral anchors + 1-parent-1-child package relay provides an intermediate solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI feel like it's not the right place to continue discussing the v3 proposal at a high-level. How about moving this discussion to https://delvingbitcoin.org/?",

[For instance when another party can attach inputs to your transaction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23121#issuecomment-929475999) (`ANYONECANPAY`, `ANYPREVOUT`).\r\n\r\nLet me ask you a simple question: are we proposing to remove RBF? Because what you said above was: \"But making RBF actually incentive compatible is a much larger undertaking (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677) than proposing a new opt-in relay regime with more constrained rules.\" I suspect you're not proposing to remove RBF, which makes the incentive compatibility of it in niche situations entirely irrelevant to my point that RBF is the better solution for this very simple problem of replacing a single transaction with another one of higher fees. Remember, that we can easily avoid all pinning problems by using the anchor channels trick of making all outputs unspendable.\r\n\r\nNow, as for the choosing a feerate in advance problem, I explained fully in my article, showing how it's quite easy to pre-sign every conceivable feerate because there just aren't that many of them. In fact, you could easily pre-sign feerates all the way to making the channel uneconomical to close, because you've spent every cent towards fees. This is not a problem.\r\n\r\nThe largest lightning channels out there are about 5BTC. *Even if* you were willing to bump fees, all the way to spending the entire 5BTC towards fees, you'd need just 68 different fee variants to go all the way from 1sat/vbyte to spending the full 5BTC on fees, with a 25% increase for each each fee variant.\r\n\r\nFinally, as I explained, you can always design the protocol to fallback to existing anchor channels at the very highest fee rate. You only need to get to the point where you've met the minimum relay fee after all.\r\n\r\n> > Are you claiming that the anchor outputs in existing Lightning anchor channels are subject to transaction pinning?\r\n> \r\n> No, but that's only because of the Lightning-specific CPFP carve-out. See also the second point of OP:\r\n\r\nSo why did you mention it? What you said was \"The v3 relay regime isn't perfect, it's just 100x better [regarding transaction pinning] for this application than the current one.\"\r\n\r\nBut as you admit, that's not true: the v3 relay regime is *worse* than the current one for Lightning channels with regard to transaction pinning, as unlike the existing regime, it's vulnerable to transaction pinning. You're claim that v3 is 100x better simply is not true for the topic at hand.\r\n\r\nNow, if V3 had some *specific* examples of proposed contracting protocols other than lightning that would use it, and are valuable for bitcoin, maybe it'd be worth considering. But at the moment, it does not.",

      "body": "> Now, as for the choosing a feerate in advance problem, I explained fully in my article, showing how it's quite easy to pre-sign every conceivable feerate because there just aren't that many of them. In fact, you could easily pre-sign feerates all the way to making the channel uneconomical to close, because you've spent every cent towards fees. This is not a problem.\r\n\r\nThat proposal ignores important drawbacks on the lightning side. I'm actually quite surprised that you don't even mention those drawbacks (which are known since [I proposed a while ago something similar to what you're advocating for](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1036) and [we already discussed them in the past](https://x.com/realtbast/status/1660912113039147008)).\r\n\r\nThe main drawback in my opinion is: if you pre-sign commitment transactions at various feerates, the actual balance that you can use off-chain is the balance of the commitment with the highest feerate. That is quite an inefficient use of your liquidity, as you'll always be locking a large amount of your lightning balance to pay the worst-case feerate! This shouldn't be an issue with eltoo, where you bring new inputs to pay the fees instead of taking them from your off-chain balance, but since we don't know whether we'll get an eltoo-enabling soft fork, we have to work without it.\r\n\r\n> Finally, as I explained, you can always design the protocol to fallback to existing anchor channels at the very highest fee rate. You only need to get to the point where you've met the minimum relay fee after all.\r\n\r\nIf you do that, you're just adding complexity without fundamentally fixing anything?\r\n\r\n> I feel like it's not the right place to continue discussing the v3 proposal at a high-level. How about moving this discussion to https://delvingbitcoin.org/?\r\n\r\nAgreed!",

      "body": "Responding to [https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review](https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review)\r\n\r\nIn general, I agree that RBF is a great fee-bumping mechanism. The entire point of v3 and EA is to make RBF more useful and less prone to pinning, and to enable us to use it in conjunction with CPFP while eliminating some of the inefficiency.\r\n\r\nWe seem to have entirely different perspectives about what RBF's limitations are today. Pointing out limitations in RBF is not intended as a personal attack. There is no intention to remove RBF. We're only trying to remove its limitations, many of which are fundamental to how mempool is currently structured.\r\n\r\nAs you can see by the timeline of posts, we started this journey by gathering information on all the limitations and grievances with RBF and going through existing proposed solutions. Please give it a read as it may help your understanding here. It lists some ideas that have been brought up and discussed multiple times (including some that you suggested) that are insufficient or not feasible in a pre-cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest particularly focusing on these limitations and their implications:\r\n- Absolute fees / Rule 3 pinning: RBF rules require the replacement transaction pay a higher absolute fee than the aggregate fees paid by all original transactions.\r\n- Replacements don't need to be more incentive compatible: it's possible for a replacement transaction to confirm slower than the replaced one, leading to ACP pinning problems.\r\n- Transactions must meet RBF rules using only their own fees: i.e. there is no package RBF; CPFPing a transaction doesn't help it replace conflicts in mempools.\r\n\r\nIf we agree that these issues need to be fixed, then the plan here (and laid out in #27463) might make more sense. It includes:\r\n- 1-parent-1-child package relay, enabling (non-batched) CPFPs below min feerate to propagate\r\n- v3: a way to opt in to stricter package limits to avoid Rule 3 + 4 pinning. Enabling EA + the next few steps\r\n- package RBF: a way for these 1-parent-1-child packages to replace each other. This allows us to remove CPFP carveout while still providing protocols with presigned transactions with a robust fee-bumping option. One of the primary goals of v3 was to make package RBF possible before cluster mempool.\r\n- cluster mempool: address the problem of assess incentive compatibility, fixing the majority of RBF problems, as well as other fundamental limitations caused by the current mempool data structures\r\n- more complete package relay, including features and fixes that are simplified or enabled by cluster mempool\r\n\r\nThis is an improvement by itself and is a stepping stone in a long-term solution to fix a number of problems. You suggested package relay as a solution; please propose an alternative implementation/timeline if you don't think this is a correct approach.\r\n\r\nI addressed [the \"V3 Transactions are still vulnerable\" article](https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review) in my [response on the mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-December/022216.html). I just mailed an update to the math this morning using the number you provided. I think the math there, as well as some basic intuition on the descendant limit restriction, shows the 100x reduction that you are denying. Not sure how to make that point more clear :shrug: happy to speak in a more synchronous fashion if you'd like.",

      "body": "@darosior \r\n\r\n> > The largest lightning channels out there are about 5BTC. Even if you were willing to bump fees, all the way to spending the entire 5BTC towards fees, you'd need just 68 different fee variants to go all the way from 1sat/vbyte to spending the full 5BTC on fees, with a 25% increase for each each fee variant.\r\n> \r\n> So you'd potentially hand to your supposedly untrusted channel partner a signature for a transaction burning your whole 4.95BTC balance to fees? This trivially opens a blackmail vector: \"sign a transaction which pays us both 2.5BTC or i burn your whole balance\".\r\n\r\nYou've misunderstood how Lightning works. While simplified explanations often talk about *the* commitment transaction, in fact Lightning channels actually have *two* slightly different commitment transactions, a local and remote transaction. Each party has a signature from the *other* side on *their* version of the commitment transaction, so broadcasting their commitment involves counter-signing it first.\r\n\r\nIn the context of RBF using channels — while there may be special circumstances requiring a different allocation — the most obvious way to allocate fees is to take the fees from the balance on each respective side. So if Alice wants to broadcast a commitment transaction, her version of the fee variants all take the funds for the fees from her balance, and Bob has given Alice a set of signatures for each fee variant. Conversely, if Bob wants to broadcast, the funds for the fees are taken from his balance. \r\n\r\nThus this blackmail attack simply is not possible as neither side has any way to spend the funds of their counterparty to fees.\r\n\r\nI've added another section to my post to make this point clear: https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review#fee-allocation",

      "body": "> > Now, as for the choosing a feerate in advance problem, I explained fully in my article, showing how it's quite easy to pre-sign every conceivable feerate because there just aren't that many of them. In fact, you could easily pre-sign feerates all the way to making the channel uneconomical to close, because you've spent every cent towards fees. This is not a problem.\r\n> \r\n> That proposal ignores important drawbacks on the lightning side. I'm actually quite surprised that you don't even mention those drawbacks (which are known since [I proposed a while ago something similar to what you're advocating for](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1036) and [we already discussed them in the past](https://x.com/realtbast/status/1660912113039147008)).\r\n\r\nI'm aware. Those proposed drawbacks are incorrect.\r\n \r\n> The main drawback in my opinion is: if you pre-sign commitment transactions at various feerates, the actual balance that you can use off-chain is the balance of the commitment with the highest feerate. That is quite an inefficient use of your liquidity, as you'll always be locking a large amount of your lightning balance to pay the worst-case feerate! This shouldn't be an issue with eltoo, where you bring new inputs to pay the fees instead of taking them from your off-chain balance, but since we don't know whether we'll get an eltoo-enabling soft fork, we have to work without it.\r\n\r\nThat \"drawback\" is a misunderstanding of economics and accounting.\r\n\r\nThe true value of your balance in a Lightning channel is always potentially reduced by the fees it would take to (force-)close the channel. CPFP or RBF does not change this: either way, if you need to (force-)close the channel, you will recover less funds than the apparent balance.\r\n\r\nSecondly, even in a naive analysis, the liquidity is not substantially reduced by RBF fees in circumstances where the Lightning channel is profitable: if potential fees are a substantial percentage of the channel balance, you're not going to make money on routing. Meanwhile, the money you make on routing is proportional to balance. So let's suppose that you pre-allocate 10% of your channel balance to paying closing fees, leaving the other 90% to route. If you earn 10% per year routing, you've only made 9% return on capital per year. Meanwhile, if you have to close that channel after a year, you've lost money. On the other hand, if you could allocate 100% to fees, your return on capital was just 10%, a 1% difference... and you've still lost money.\r\n\r\nBut *even that* is actually incorrect: the highest feerate you could ever possibly need is the one where all of your balance in the channel goes to fees. Feerates beyond that are simply pointless: you might as well just wait for fees to decrease, to abandon the funds, as you're not recovering any value. CPFP/anchor channels does allow you to pay even higher fee rates. But doing so doesn't make any sense. Thus there is no liquidity wasted with RBF: you can spend 100% of the available channel balance on your side at any time. Of course, at some point the fee rate required implies that the channel reserve is probably too low. But that's a problem we already have in existing Lightning channels; CPFP/anchors doesn't change that.\r\n\r\n> > Finally, as I explained, you can always design the protocol to fallback to existing anchor channels at the very highest fee rate. You only need to get to the point where you've met the minimum relay fee after all.\r\n> \r\n> If you do that, you're just adding complexity without fundamentally fixing anything?\r\n\r\nNope. In the usual case where RBF works you'll spend ~50% on fees, while avoiding the creation of large incentives for pools to centralize to offer out-of-band fees.",

      "body": "> Responding to https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review\r\n> \r\n> In general, I agree that RBF is a great fee-bumping mechanism. The entire point of v3 and EA is to make RBF more useful and less prone to pinning, and to enable us to use it in conjunction with CPFP while eliminating some of the inefficiency.\r\n> \r\n> We seem to have entirely different perspectives about what RBF's limitations are today. Pointing out limitations in RBF is not intended as a personal attack. There is no intention to remove RBF. We're only trying to remove its limitations, many of which are fundamental to how mempool is currently structured.\r\n\r\nNone of this discussion has anything to do with \"personal attacks\". The question is if V3 transactions fixes a problem that exists in *actual* protocols, not hypothetical situations. Bringing up issues with RBF that are not relevant to the actual protocols being discussed is misleading.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, what I'm showing is that V3 transactions, as proposed, fails to improve the situation for Lightning channels. The claimed tx pinning vector is not relevant, and V3 doubles down on a serious design flaw with regard to out-of-band fee payments. We should fix that design flaw, and RBF almost certainly the best solution possible.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do now, if you wish to progress further on V3 transactions, is show how it will fix *actual* problems in existing or proposed contracting systems such as Lightning. Once we have identified those problems, we can discuss solutions, and see if V3 can fix those actual problems.\r\n\r\nThe root problem here is we have done this backwards: we have a rough idea of what some problems could be, V3 was proposed, and people have gotten excited that it seems to fix these hypothetical problems.\r\n\r\n> I'd suggest particularly focusing on these limitations and their implications:\r\n> \r\n>     * Absolute fees / Rule 3 pinning: RBF rules require the replacement transaction pay a higher absolute fee than the aggregate fees paid by all original transactions.\r\n> \r\n>     * Replacements don't need to be more incentive compatible: it's possible for a replacement transaction to confirm slower than the replaced one, leading to ACP pinning problems.\r\n> \r\n>     * Transactions must meet RBF rules using only their own fees: i.e. there is no package RBF; CPFPing a transaction doesn't help it replace conflicts in mempools.\r\n\r\nThis kind of thinking is precisely the problem: you've listed a bunch of potential problems, without any discussion of how actual protocols are impacted by those problems. This is bad design: you should focus on the actual problems real protocols run into, and then figure out how to solve those problems.\r\n \r\n> I addressed [the \"V3 Transactions are still vulnerable\" article](https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review) in my [response on the mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-December/022216.html). I just mailed an update to the math this morning using the number you provided. I think the math there, as well as some basic intuition on the descendant limit restriction, shows the 100x reduction that you are denying. Not sure how to make that point more clear 🤷 happy to speak in a more synchronous fashion if you'd like.\r\n\r\nAgain, I am not denying that there is a 100x reduction in the hypothetical situation of transaction pinning. What I am pointing out is that Lightning already fixed that transaction pinning problem with the design of anchor channels, making your 100x reduction irrelevant.\r\n\r\nThis entire discussion is similar to installing a lift kit on a Honda Civic mainly used to pick up groceries, and bragging about how you've increased ground clearance to 1m. It's a cool engineering challenge. But if our actual problem is high gas prices, not low ground clearance, why are we adding the extra weight and complexity of the lift kit?",

      "body": "> You've misunderstood how Lightning works. While simplified explanations often talk about [...]\r\n\r\nI see how a superficial understanding of Lightning and pinning issues could lead you to think that. However your hot fix to your proposal does not patch all its flaws.\r\n \r\n> In the context of RBF using channels — while there may be special circumstances requiring a different allocation — the most obvious way to allocate fees is to take the fees from the balance on each respective side. So if Alice wants to broadcast a commitment transaction, her version of the fee variants all take the funds for the fees from her balance, and Bob has given Alice a set of signatures for each fee variant. Conversely, if Bob wants to broadcast, the funds for the fees are taken from his balance.\r\n\r\nYou don't only need fees for your established balance, but also for your in-flight balance. Alice may only have the reserve as her balance in the channel (or no balance at all, for instance right after Bob opened a channel to her) and have to resolve an incoming HTLC as soon as possible. Here Bob could trivially pin her attempt to resolve the HTLC by broadcasting the first version of his commit tx which Alice won't be able to replace. She would have to broadcast a pair <Alice's commit tx, htlc success with fees> to replace Bob's commit tx, but for this you need package RBF which needs v3.\r\n\r\nLast thing i'll say here, v3 (+EA) is not only useful for current Lightning channels. You can think about it as a better carve-out. The CPFP carve-out is a very Lightning-specific hack to the mempool validation rules. v3 is a more general way of achieving the same, and more, for any protocol.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat's my last message on this topic here. I don't want to further derail this pull request.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to continue discussing v3 [at Delving](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/v3-transaction-policy-for-anti-pinning/340) as long as we keep the discussion intellectually honest. I'm not interested in this little game of arguing to appear smart (or try to, at least) instead of arguing to make progress toward a better and technically sound proposal.",

      "body": "> As noted in delving, pinning is not solved for anchor channels(even if we assume package relay/rbf is implemented): If an adversary splits the view of which commitment transaction is broadcasted, the remote copy can become the pin since the defender is unable to propagate their spend of the remote commit tx anchor.\r\n\r\nYou're really describing a form of MITM attack. If the target learns about the existence of the other commitment transaction, be it a revoked transaction or the remote's version of the current one, they can easily get that transaction mined by spending their anchor output (or other outputs if it's a revoked state).\r\n\r\nSecondly, V3 transactions doesn't fully fix this either. For channels that can have large numbers of HTLCs in flight, an adversary can pin with a revoked commitment from a point in the channel's lifetime where the # of HTLCs in flight towards them was large.\r\n\r\nNotably, this kind of circumstance shows why concerns about RBF with all the funds on one side of the channel are a little silly... Lightning is broken in a lot of ways when you get into that circumstance.\r\n\r\n> V3 is useful for any transactions where you don't want to be RBF-pinned for sending to arbitrary scripts. For example in splicing, rather than requiring each address being sent to including a 1 OP_CSV clause over each spending condition, it can now be arbitrary scriptPubKeys. More generally, it allows this relaxation for any payment where you want to RBF the payment.\r\n\r\nYou're splicing example is one where V3 is not clearly incentive compatible, and you're encouraging wallets to degrade privacy by making transactions from different wallets clearly distinct. It's a good thing that, eg, Phoenix has shipped with splicing and without that restriction.\r\n\r\nNow, if the OP wanted to argue for those kinds of detailed tradeoffs, the correct way to do so would be with detailed design documents. But that hasn't happened. There's not even a BIP for this.",

      "body": "> > You've misunderstood how Lightning works. While simplified explanations often talk about [...]\r\n> \r\n> I see how a superficial understanding of Lightning and pinning issues could lead you to think that. However your hot fix to your proposal does not patch all its flaws.\r\n\r\nIt's not a \"hot fix\", it's the only way it could have ever worked. The remote and local transactions are fundamental to Lightning; I didn't mention that explicitly because I thought it would be obvious to anyone familiar with the protocol in depth.\r\n \r\n> > In the context of RBF using channels — while there may be special circumstances requiring a different allocation — the most obvious way to allocate fees is to take the fees from the balance on each respective side. So if Alice wants to broadcast a commitment transaction, her version of the fee variants all take the funds for the fees from her balance, and Bob has given Alice a set of signatures for each fee variant. Conversely, if Bob wants to broadcast, the funds for the fees are taken from his balance.\r\n> \r\n> You don't only need fees for your established balance, but also for your in-flight balance. Alice may only have the reserve as her balance in the channel (or no balance at all, for instance right after Bob opened a channel to her) and have to resolve an incoming HTLC as soon as possible. Here Bob could trivially pin her attempt to resolve the HTLC by broadcasting the first version of his commit tx which Alice won't be able to replace. She would have to broadcast a pair <Alice's commit tx, htlc success with fees> to replace Bob's commit tx, but for this you need package RBF which needs v3.\r\n\r\nIf Bob broadcasts his *first* version of his commit tx, he's broadcasting a revoked state and Alice can simply take his funds.\r\n\r\nNow, if you mean that Bob is broadcasting his *current* version of his remote tx, that situation was already discussed on Twitter. That situation is kinda busted in general, as Lightning's incentives are a bit dubious unless both parties have funds in the channel. Using a signed anchor output that only Alice can spend is a perfectly reasonable approach, as it's rare enough that it won't be a substantial threat to mining decentralization via out-of-band fees. It's probably also reasonable to consider limiting HTLC size in general during initial channel startup until a reasonable channel reserve is reached.\r\n\r\n> Last thing i'll say here, v3 (+EA) is not only useful for current Lightning channels. You can think about it as a better carve-out. The CPFP carve-out is a very Lightning-specific hack to the mempool validation rules. v3 is a more general way of achieving the same, and more, for any protocol.\r\n\r\nAs I keep saying, that's nice to speculate about. But these potential protocols need to be discussed in detail so costs and benefits can be worked out. It is disappointing that I seem to have been the first person to point out how dangerous anchor outputs are to mining decentralization; CPFP usage in general has this potential problem, and we should be careful not to encourage more of it.\r\n\r\n> I'm happy to continue discussing v3 [at Delving](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/v3-transaction-policy-for-anti-pinning/340) as long as we keep the discussion intellectually honest. I'm not interested in this little game of arguing to appear smart (or try to, at least) instead of arguing to make progress toward a better and technically sound proposal.\r\n\r\nI'm not on delving and I have no intent of doing so at the moment. Putting critical protocol discussion on infrastructure that is not cryptographically signed, and under the centralized control of parties with a direct interest in the discussion, is not a good idea. The email list remains a much better alternative as email is signed via both DKIM and, in some cases, PGP. GitHub second best, as at least the infrastructure is run by people entirely independent of Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I've already had a few people tell me privately that your personal attacks here, like attempting to claim I have a \"superficial understanding of Lightning\", and writing this off as a \"little game of arguing to appear smart\", makes you look \"butthurt\" and \"petty\".",

      "body": "Thanks for your answers @petertodd.\r\n\r\nI think we may be talking a bit past each other in some of those comments, because most of this is too vague and ignores important low-level details. I'll try to highlight the most important high-level points below.\r\n\r\n> So if Alice wants to broadcast a commitment transaction, her version of the fee variants all take the funds for the fees from her balance, and Bob has given Alice a set of signatures for each fee variant. Conversely, if Bob wants to broadcast, the funds for the fees are taken from his balance.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit lost, that's not at all how lightning works today? The fees are always taken from the balance of the channel initiator, regardless of whether it's Alice's or Bob's commitment transaction.\r\n\r\nThat's a design decision that could potentially be revisited, and it has been evaluated a few times already, but doing so creates other drawbacks.\r\n\r\n> The true value of your balance in a Lightning channel is always potentially reduced by the fees it would take to (force-)close the channel. CPFP or RBF does not change this: either way, if you need to (force-)close the channel, you will recover less funds than the apparent balance.\r\n\r\nI think you didn't understand my point (or maybe you are thinking about something that works differently than lightning today, but I'm not sure how exactly it would work). What I was saying is that pre-signing multiple versions of the commitment at various feerates forces your lightning balance (and other lightning constraints) to use **the most restrictive variant of the commitment**.\r\n\r\nThat means using RBF is much more restrictive than CPFP: with CPFP, you are only constrained by whatever fee you want to pay at broadcast time, while with RBF you are constrained by the _highest_ feerate you may be willing to pay. The difference between those values is going to be large most of the time, which is quite inefficient.\r\n\r\nThe balance you can actually use in your lightning channel (if you're the initiator) is `to_local - channel_reserve - commit_tx_fees`.\r\nIf you're pre-signing N commitment transactions at feerates `[f1; ...; fN]`, the balance you can actually use is `to_local - channel_reserve - max(commit_tx_fees1, ..., commit_tx_feesN)`.\r\nOtherwise you wouldn't be able to really offer a commitment transaction at all the chosen feerates.\r\n\r\nPre-signing multiple feerates creates other complex subtleties on the lightning side, as was detailed in comments on [my spec PR](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1036). Making the commitment transaction pay no on-chain fees greatly simplifies the lightning protocol, and provides a better decoupling from on-chain fees, ensuring that you only care about them at broadcast time and they don't interfere while you're transacting on lightning. Since force-closing is exceptional, I believe this is a design choice that makes a lot of sense, by optimizing for the most common case.\r\n\r\n> That \"drawback\" is a misunderstanding of economics and accounting.\r\n\r\nWhile your point may be an arguable trade-off for routing nodes, it ignores end users, who really want to maximize their liquidity usage. And the vast majority of channels will be with end users, so it's an important case to optimize for IMHO.\r\n",

With anchor outputs, beyond the basic fee\nlevel, fees are paid by whichever side wants to pay them, potentially both\nparties at once. Furthermore, people are proposing (via ephemeral anchors and\npackage relay) that fees always be paid this way, with the commitment\ntransaction itself having no fee at all.\n\nEconomically speaking, what I'm proposing with RBF channels is very close to\nthe status quo.\n\n> > The true value of your balance in a Lightning channel is always potentially reduced by the fees it would take to (force-)close the channel. CPFP or RBF does not change this: either way, if you need to (force-)close the channel, you will recover less funds than the apparent balance.\n> \n> I think you didn't understand my point\n\nI understand your point. I'm talking about the true economics of a lightning\nchannel, not the raw numbers.\n\n> (or maybe you are thinking about something that works differently than lightning today, but I'm not sure how exactly it would work). What I was saying is that pre-signing multiple versions of the commitment at various feerates forces your lightning balance (and other lightning constraints) to use **the most restrictive variant of the commitment**.\n> \n> That means using RBF is much more restrictive than CPFP: with CPFP, you are only constrained by whatever fee you want to pay at broadcast time, while with RBF you are constrained by the highest feerate you may be willing to pay. The difference between those values is going to be large most of the time, which is quite inefficient.\n\nAgain, what I showed in my post, and explained multiple times above, was that:\n\n1. Any conceivable feerate, at very fine granularity, is feasible to pre-sign. Computers are fast, and signatures are small, so signing a few dozen variants to cover everything is not hard.\n2. It is pointless to pay more money in fees than you can recover from the channel.\n\nThe only nuance anyone has identified with #2 is when large in-flight HTLC's\nexist, and the channel balance is smaller than the fee you might want to pay.\n\n> The balance you can actually use in your lightning channel (if you're the initiator) is `to_local - channel_reserve - commit_tx_fees`.\n> If you're pre-signing N commitment transactions at feerates `[f1; ...; fN]`, the balance you can actually use is `to_local - channel_reserve - max(commit_tx_fees1, ..., commit_tx_feesN)`.\n> Otherwise you wouldn't be able to really offer a commitment transaction at all the chosen feerates.\n\nI've already demonstrated in a message above how in profitable routing node\nscenarios, for actual economical usage of the channel with reasonable revenue\nestimates, reserving funds for pay fees is an insignificant percentage of the\nchannel balance. I would suggest you read that and actually work through a real\nexample. Also, I would stress that you think about what the economics of the\nchannel reserve actually means: if fees are significant in relation to it, it\nisn't high enough to represent a real incentive.\n\nAs for end user wallets, keep reading.\n\n> Pre-signing multiple feerates creates other complex subtleties on the lightning side, as was detailed in comments on [my spec PR](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1036). Making the commitment transaction pay no on-chain fees greatly simplifies the lightning protocol, and provides a better decoupling from on-chain fees, ensuring that you only care about them at broadcast time and they don't interfere while you're transacting on lightning. Since force-closing is exceptional, I believe this is a design choice that makes a lot of sense, by optimizing for the common case.\n\nNo, force-closing is main the limiting factor in Lightning safety engineering:\nthe need to tolerate large numbers of force closes at once, without running out\nof block space, limits how much we can possible scale lightning. It is very\nimportant to keep force closing efficient to allow as many lightning users as\npossible.\n\n> > That \"drawback\" is a misunderstanding of economics and accounting.\n> \n> While your point may be an arguable trade-off for routing nodes, it ignores end users, who really want to maximize their liquidity usage.\n> And the vast majority of channels will be with end users, so it's an important case to optimize for IMHO.\n\nQuite the opposite: to maximize liquidity usage you want to get rid of the very\ninconvenient fact that anchor outputs forces you to have UTXO's lying around\nwith sufficient funds to pay fees in all circumstances.  As I explained in my\nV3 Transactions Review post, anchor channels are particularly harmful for end\nuser wallets. In fact, what's probably the most common non-custodial end-user\nimplementation out there, Phoenix, recently added limited RBF channel support.\nAnd they _don't_ keep around extra UTXO's to spend via anchors, because of\ncourse, that impacts liquidity!\n",

          "body": "C++20 introduced the `contains` method on containers to check if an element is in the container. It can be used instead of the `count` method now.\r\nI believe it is easier to understand, as `contains` directly returns a `bool` indicating whether the element exists, while `count` returns the number of occurrences of the element, which then often needs to be compared against 0.\r\nAlso, it is slightly more efficient than count for this use-case.\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces the clang-tidy check `readability-container-contains` and fixes the instances where `count` is being used where `contains` could be used instead. I used the clang-tidy -fix option to do it automatically.",

Since that might be much higher than what the honest party wants to pay for a CPFP of their more recent channel state.\r\n- The honest party is able to grab those funds with the revocation key if this tx confirms, but it might just sit in the mempool and be hard to replace.\r\n- You're saying that since this is still possible in a v3 world, v3 is not effective in pinning prevention.\r\n\r\nIs this a pinning issue or a problem with how they negotiated the max htlcs? It's one thing for an attacker to attach descendants to the shared transaction and take advantage of the permissive limit. It's another thing to willingly sign a huge transaction with somebody and be surprised later if they broadcast it.\r\n\r\n> Yes `max_offered_htlc` chan policy param can be introduced at the LN-level to bound more commitment size.\r\n\r\nIs that different from `max_accepted_htlcs`? Or do you mean a hard limit within the protocol?\r\nhttps://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/8a64c6a1cef979b3f0cecb00ba7a48c2d28b3588/02-peer-protocol.md?plain=1#L159-L162\r\n\r\nThat seems to be the solution. There isn't anything we can do at the mempool policy level to prevent conflicting transactions from being very different sizes, except to decrease the maximum standard transaction size.",

      "body": "Another thing to note about this attack is that the attacker would be losing funds in the process if the attacked node simply spends the revoked commitments outputs (instead of trying to replace it). Whenever one side publishes a revoked commitment, they will lose any funds that they had in the channel (which is at least their channel reserve, thus 1% of the channel). So the attacked node would pay a large on-chain fee, but would also earn the funds that the attacker loses. In the worst case scenario, it means that both sides lose money if the fee is larger than the attacker's channel balance (which may be an acceptable scorched earth strategy).\r\n\r\nLightning node operators should use sensible values for their channel parameters (such as `max_accepted_htlcs`) to ensure that the attacker has more to lose if they publish a revoked commitment (that's why eclair's default value for `max_accepted_htlcs` has been `30` for years, which is much lower than `483`).",

      "body": "I realized after posting the quick thoughts yesterday that some replacement tactic alters significantly the anti-v3 pinning mitigation at the advantage of an adversary economics, so here one of the most adversarial pinning scenario I can come with.\r\n\r\nAssume the attacker strategy is a rule-3 based pinning targeting the double-spend of forwaded HTLC over a target LN routing node. Let's call them Alice and Mallory. Assume the channel is 1_000_000 sats, `max_htlc_value_in_flight`=50% (i.e 500_000 sats), `cltv_expiry_delta`=144, all liquidity balance is on Alice-side, Mallory's `channel_reserve` is non-existent (inbound liquidity channel out-of-band buy). Mallory's topology setup cost has been 1000 sats in period of low-fees. Assume nversion=3 with 1 child 1k limit and its support at the LN-level.\r\n\r\nHere the sequence of actions:\r\n1. Mallory routes over Alice 483 HTLCs, gets local revoked state of size 21k vbytes at 20 sats/vbyte\r\n2. Mallory waits for a mempool backlog of depth 144 blocks with the feerate superior at 20 sat/vbytes\r\n3. Network mempool rolling min fee is at 5 sat/vbytes, assuming default `maxmempool` size\r\n4. Mallory routes a HTLC over Alice from a puppet inbound node of amount 440_000 satoshis\r\n5. Mallory broadcasts in network mempools revoked state 21k at 20 sats/vbyte + child 1k at 20 sats/vbyte\r\n6. Alice cannot over-pay in absolute fees to replace Mallory state due to \"max at stake\" 440k sats\r\n7. The mempool backlog of 144 blocks is swallowed by blocks confirmations ; The inbound HTLC is expired\r\n8. Mallory replaces first her malicious state with a commitment tx 1k vbyte at 10 sats/vbytes + child 1k vbytes at 400 sats/vbyte (+ RBF penalty)\r\n9. Mallory replaces this high-fee CPFP on a \"parallel\" pinning state and repeat the \"parallel-CPFP\" trick N times\r\n10. Mallory double-spend the inbound HTLC with a commitment_tx + HTLC-timeout of package size 1k at 20 sat/vbytes\r\n\r\nThe per-channel attacking cost for Mallory are the following:\r\na) chan topology setup = 1000 sats\r\nb) inbound chan double-spend package cost = 20k sats\r\nc) outbound chan commitment tx cost = 10k cost\r\n\r\nPer-channel total cost: 31k.\r\n\r\nThere is an overall CPFP cost of 440k sats + N * rbf_penalty * 1k.\r\nAssuming N = 10 and RBF penalty = 1 sat/vbyte, the overall CPFP cost is 450k sats.\r\n\r\nThe per-channel attacker gain for Mallory is 440k sats.\r\n\r\nThe total gain for Mallory is the following equation: `440_000 * 10 - (31_000 * 10 + 450_000)`, i.e `3'640k sats.\r\n\r\nAssuming the above demonstration is correct, in reason of \"parallel\" pinning against an uncoordinated set of target LN routing nodes, an attacker can realize a substantial gain incentivizig the attempt of pinning attack at scale, even in a nversion=3 transaction-relay network of nodes world.\r\n\r\nI think an alternative solution like \"replace-by-feerate\" suffers from the same type of \"parallel\" package tampering weakness, where an adversary can \"adaptatively\" plug high-feerate malicious package, then dismembers them to block the confirmation of a LN routing node aiming to HTLC-timeout offered outputs on its commitment transaction.\r\n\r\nI believe the most-robust pinning solution is taking the long-term direction of consensus changes, where a) commitment transaction weight should be constant - all HTLC encapsulated in a covenant-tree and b) feerate set  by an IN_OUT_AMOUNT opcode where the fee value is self-contained from spending commitment transaction input. Fee\r\nbidding among a set of trust-minimized off-chain counterparties would be a monotonically increasing process happening in public network mempools. This would remove package malleability and preventing pinning / replacement cycling kind of attack games. While this is yet to be demonstrated, I think it's generalizing well to all time-sensitive L2s.\r\n\r\nI think the concern of mining income asymmetries favored by generalized CPFP usage is valid. However, whatever we're finally doing as protocol devs in Bitcoin Core or any base-layer implementation, this does not prevent each mining pool to deploy on their own \"anti pinning nversion=3\" service, as we're seeing with \"transaction accelerator”. I can see LN node operators adopting such new service as implemented correctly by mining pools / miners (this is  a big assumption), it would provide minimal protection in face of naive pinning adversaries. (I.e the ones who don’t have the domain expertise to execute the variation of the attack exposed above). As a historical note, we weighted mining-level pinning mitigations years ago and we disregarded them due to concerns on mining decentralization and incentives misalignment, if you’re LN counterparty is a miner too.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm ~0 on continuing or not to implement and deploy nversion=3 as a default mempool policy rules over the network.\r\nI just fear LN folks will go for years-long of integrating a frail mechanism in their software, while at the meantime hitting\r\na wormhole of issues related to heterogeneity of nodes policies / ressources and use-case incentives, like we have seen with full-rbf.",

Whenever one side publishes a revoked > commitment, they will lose any funds that they had in the channel (which is at least their channel reserve, thus 1% of the > channel). So the attacked node would pay a large on-chain fee, but would also earn the funds that the attacker loses. In > the worst case scenario, it means that both sides lose money if the fee is larger than the attacker's channel balance > (which may be an acceptable scorched earth strategy).\r\n\r\nSee the math above, works with latest valid commitment routing at `max_accepted_htlc` / hyptothetical `max_offered_htlc` and I think you can arrange to have a 0 `channel_reserve` thanks to inbound liquidity buy (though non-standardized mechanism). Bounding more LN package weight, payment throughput trade-off and at the end an adversary can “batch” the attack to be “break-even”.\r\n\r\nYes, you can adopt nversion=3 parameters and chan policy parameters so restrictive to have a single HTLC output and a single CPFP of the minimal size, though a) adversary can still “jump” the CPFP over many “parallel” pinning attacks assume adversary have superior mempool views than targets and can choose when to forward HTLC and have them `cltv_expiry_delta` locks over a path and b) breaks every time we would upgrade channel type for new segwit versions or whatever and corresponding witness size.",

      "body": "> max_accepted_htlcs is a limit on the number of inbound HTLCs. max_offered_htlc would be some new BOLT-channel policy parameter to limit the number of outbound HTLCs, the idea has floated few times among LN folks to bind max commitment transaction size.\r\n\r\nThis new `max_offered_htlc` parameter is unnecessary. An HTLC sender unilaterally decides whether they send HTLCs or not, and can ensure that they never send more outgoing HTLCs than their `max_accepted_htlcs`. That has always been eclair's behavior by the way: our default is `max_accepted_htlcs = 30`, we have many peers that set their `max_accepted_htlcs = 483`, but we never offer them more than 30 HTLCs.\r\n\r\n> I believe the most-robust pinning solution is taking the long-term direction of consensus changes, where a) commitment transaction weight should be constant - all HTLC encapsulated in a covenant-tree and b) feerate set by an IN_OUT_AMOUNT opcode where the fee value is self-contained from spending commitment transaction input.\r\n\r\nThis would indeed be a potential longer term solution (I believe that Eltoo does something similar), but as it requires a soft-fork, this is much longer term than mitigating this issue now (and I still believe v3/EA does improve this issue, because the attack you're describing most likely also works without v3 and costs even more for the attacked node).\r\n\r\n> 4. Mallory routes a HTLC over Alice from a puppet inbound node of amount 440_000 satoshis\r\n\r\nI don't understand in which direction this HTLC is flowing (the `from` and `inbound` seem contradictory), and I'm not sure whether the HTLCs you described in step 1 were fulfilled or failed. I'm failing to understand your attack scenario: many details are missing in my opinion (which HTLCs are failed/fulfilled, and at what step?). Can you provide a more thorough description of every step so that we can analyze this better?",

HTLC on Alice-Mallory link is fulfilled after pinning success. HTLC on Mallet-Alice link is failed, thus double-spend. There is a first wave of routed HTLCs to get a max size commitment tx, then only 1 routed HTLC, as a revoked state is used to pin. Note, you can use a valid commitment state, with 482 dust threshold HTLC+1 and one HTLC at 440k sats you'll double-spend.",

With a mempool depth superior to X (the sat/vbyte) and Y (the MB depth of transaction superior to X - must be superior to target `cltv_expiry_delta`), the remaining pinning exposure stay \"max package size\" * X. E.g if `cltv_expiry_delt`=144, mempool backlog of depth block_size * 144 superior to 20 sat/byte and max package size 4k byte, your pinning exposure is ~80k sats.\r\n\r\nAs liquidity is a scarce resource, LN node ops have an incentive to scale down 144, or at least keep it bounded in case the channel goes-to-chain. This lowers the likeliness of mempool environment fulfilling opportunistic conditions of backlog for pinning attackers to target LN nodes. Bounding the numbers of HTLCs per-channel reduces the LN node payment throughput, while max_accepted_htlc of dozens of HTLCs are rarely reached in practice, this will be less certain in the future.\r\n\r\nOf course, a LN node operator might run mempool backlog predictions, and from this statically or dynamically adapt its max pinning exposure (by playing on the `max_accepted_htlc` and `cltv_expiry_delta`). However, if the prediction fails and once you have HTLCs locked paymnent paths, you're irremediably exposed to pinning attacks, potentially overriding your max acceptable \"pinning exposure\" (like we have for dust with `max_dust_htlc_exposure`).\r\n\r\nSo yes v3 reduces pinning exposure (in the absolute). However no, it doesn't solve all the pinning scenarios in my opinion, and it's a weak solution if you have medium to advanced attackers that can predict mempool backlogs and opportunistic conditions of pinning exploitation better than the average LN node. I’m neutral on v3 deployment, I just fear this is not a pinning mitigation which is going to age well...",

      "body": "> Which means they'll remain pinnable, due to the SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY signatures, allowing anyone to turn them into large, pinned, high fee/low fee-rate transactions by adding additional inputs (and outputs).\r\n\r\nI may be missing something here, can you describe in more details how *anyone* could turn them into large pinning txs? They do require signatures from _both_ participants, and one of them is going to be `SIGHASH_ALL`. So the only participant that may play pinning games is the owner of the HTLC-x transaction. The only issue I could see with that is if they're doing this with HTLC-success txs while eclipsing their peer to prevent them from learning the preimage. As detailed [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/lightning-transactions-with-v3-and-ephemeral-anchors/418/17?u=t-bast), that can be mitigated by various mechanisms and the attacker has a risk of losing funds, so I don't think this should be related in any way to v3?",

      "body": "Thanks for the clarification @ariard, I think I understand your scenario better. But there's one point I don't understand: in step 6 (`Alice cannot over-pay in absolute fees to replace Mallory state due to \"max at stake\" 440k sats`), Alice doesn't want to replace Mallory's revoked commitment, she wants it to confirm to spend all the output to herself?\r\n\r\nIt's easy for Alice to make the revoked commitment confirm, she can use any output of that transaction to CPFP and she doesn't need to add any of her wallet inputs, she can just use the channel funds for that.\r\n\r\nAlice can then use a low feerate to spend all the HTLC outputs of the confirmed revoked commitment, because to get them back, Mallory would have to get her HTLC-x transaction confirmed (which costs fees to Mallory) and wait the `to_self_delay` to broadcast her 3rd-stage tx (at which point Alice would simply spend the output of the HTLC-x transaction to herself through the revocation path).\r\n\r\nSo the only issue I see here is that it may be uneconomical to sweep funds from a commitment transaction that has many small HTLC outputs, but that's a more general trade-off of lightning and is why node operators should tweak their `max_accepted_htlcs` accordingly?",

Assuming no 1 CSV, yes in my scenario. However attacker can construct revoked or valid pinning state to have the 483 outputs as inbound HTLC to inflate. Alice no preimage to spend them. Only anchor output available and liquidity has to be brought from fee-bumping reserves to replace max at stake 440k sats. Yes, you can honest blind CPFP at max at stake and no more pinning issues. If a) you maintain that level of fee-bumping reserves and b) you have a wormholes of fee griefing issues. Fee griefing no good if counterparties are miners or concurrent LSPs that wish to push you out of market. ",

I think when stripped of historical baggage, it only needs to be:\r\n\r\nunconfirmed v3 transactions:\r\n * are always subject to rbf rules\r\n * can have at most one unconfirmed v3 ancestor or one unconfirmed v3 descendent, but not both (may have many confirmed ancestors, may not have any uncofirmed v2 ancestors or descendents)\r\n * a v3 descendent is limited to 1000vb\r\n * if the tx has a descendent, only the combination is subject to mempool minfee rules\r\n\r\n(which is only really 4 rules, rather than 7, since it combines 2/3/4/6 into a single rule)",

It would be nice to have a really concise reference, that leaves the rationales/comparisons to an appendix or something. I think when stripped of historical baggage, it only needs to be:\r\n> ...\r\n\r\nI've consolidated the rules in the BIP (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1541), agree it's easier to understand this way.\r\n\r\nI'll delete or clean up the version3_transactions.md doc here now that the information has been moved to the BIP. We can create a more concise reference that includes the various components, though I'm not sure how much of that should be in this PR. Perhaps somewhere more live like the devwiki for now, while things are still wip?",

          "title": "Cluster mempool, CPFP carveout, and V3 transaction policy",
          "body": "Opening an issue for high-level discussion, as the PR that implements this has gotten difficult to follow.\r\n\r\n### Cluster mempool\r\n\r\nWork is underway to [redesign the mempool](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393/1) with different topology constraints on the transaction graph than exist today.  I originally described this proposal in a github issue (#27677), and have shared a draft implementation (#28676).  In brief, with a new mempool design we could simultaneously: fix bugs with mempool eviction and the incentive compatibility of RBF replacements; achieve improved performance; eliminate the ancestor/descendant limits (with the introduction of a likely more relaxed \"cluster\" limit); and likely be in a position to better implement complex behaviors like package validation and package rbf.\r\n\r\n### CPFP carveout is not compatible with cluster mempool\r\n\r\nAs I explain [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/an-overview-of-the-cluster-mempool-proposal/393#the-cpfp-carveout-rule-can-no-longer-be-supported-12), I believe the CPFP carveout rule (introduced in #15681) is not compatible with the new design. Since some users may be relying on this behavior, we should come up with a workaround to avoid breaking existing applications.\r\n\r\n### V3 transaction policy\r\n\r\nDescribed in #28948, the v3 transaction policy is a proposal to introduce topology restrictions on unconfirmed transactions with `nVersion=3` (which are currently non-standard for relay, and would be made standard under the proposal).  Specifically, v3 transactions would be:\r\n- opted-in to RBF replacement policies (whatever those may be, as they evolve in our project)\r\n- permitted to only be part of mempool clusters that are at most of size 2 (meaning 1 parent/1 child)\r\n- required to have any unconfirmed parents or children also be marked v3 (and therefore subject to these rules)\r\n- bounded in size to at most 1000 vbytes, if the child of an unconfirmed (and therefore v3) parent\r\n\r\nBy offering a policy rule that can enforce a much tighter topology restriction that the current ancestor/descendant limits, we hope to achieve a few things:\r\n\r\n#### Replacing CPFP carveout (with a new sibling-replacement policy)\r\n\r\nWe can provide a way to achieve the goals of the CPFP carveout rule even if the existing carevout rule were to be dropped. As explained in [this post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-November/016518.html), the use-case contemplated by the CPFP carveout rule was one where a single transaction might have two spendable outputs, each spendable by a different party, and that either party should be able to spend their output without hitting global topology limits, provided that their spending transaction was bounded in size and had no other unconfirmed parents. If the v3 policy rule were to be applied to the LN commitment transactions described in that post, then neither of the two outputs that are spendable could be used to hit the limits that carveout is designed to bypass. \r\n\r\nSo if we couple the v3 policy with an RBF rule that would allow one spend of a v3 transaction to replace an existing lower-feerate spend of that same parent -- something we call *sibling eviction* and has a draft implementation in #29306 -- then I believe we will have enacted a set of policies that replicate the CPFP carveout use case. \r\n\r\n#### Provide a general way for fee bumping to work better\r\n\r\nEven apart from the needs of layer 2 protocols, the new v3 policy serves as a general way to bypass the issue of RBF being expensive when a child transaction is created that has a large fee (and is typically large in size, allowing for it to be low feerate).  This has been the source of user complaints since our RBF policies were first deployed, and by bounding the size of child transactions we effectively can limit the amount of additional fee a user would need to pay due to the presence of such children.  \r\n\r\nNote, of course, that this property is also what makes the sibling-eviction-policy described above workable.\r\n\r\n### Proposed roadmap\r\n\r\nTo unblock the cluster mempool project, I think we need the following:\r\n1. Deployment of the V3 policy rules (current proposal is #28948)\r\n2. Deployment of V3 sibling eviction rbf rules (current proposal is #29306)\r\n\r\nThen, projects that use CPFP carveout would need to be able to adopt the new policy rules.  After the last LN spec discussion, I understand that migrating their commitment transactions to use a new format (even just a change in version number) might take time to coordinate, and that in the meantime we should simply use some other unique markers to identify those commitment transactions, and implicitly imbue such transactions with the v3 policy rules.  However, doing so would eliminate the ability to batch-CPFP several unconfirmed commitment transactions at once (although this isn't reliable anyway today, since the carveout protections don't apply to this case, but perhaps this sometimes works fine and is more efficient).\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me if that final step -- of imbuing transactions with v3 policy, rather than requiring explicit opt-in -- is needed before we move further forward with cluster mempool, or even if doing so would be acceptable to the broader community, but I think we could entertain that idea as a way to assist the LN project with migration and to decouple progress in this project from upgrade timelines in that one.\r\n\r\n### Feedback\r\n\r\nWhile we're still working out implementation details in the v3 and v3-sibling-eviction PRs, it would be great to get concept ACKs on this roadmap from any users of the current CPFP carveout policy.  In particular, please provide feedback on:\r\n1. whether there are use cases of CPFP carveout that are not covered by the V3 proposal as I described above, and \r\n2. whether the \"imbued v3\" behavior described above should be treated as a blocker for CPFP carveout removal as well, or if it's a bad idea due to (eg) breaking the ability to batch-CPFP (or any other reason)",

Instead I threaded through the max fee argument and used that directly via ATMPArgs. From that perspective, this is somewhat a reversion from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19339. In a post-cluster mempool world, these checks could be consolidated to right after the given (ancestor) package is linearized/chunked, by just checking the feerate of the top chunk and rejecting the submission entirely if the top chunk is too high.\r\n\r\nThe implication here is that subpackages can be submitted to the mempool prior to hitting this new fee-based error condition.",

Unless you're thinking of a different scenario this time? \r\n\r\nStill the same scenario than laid out in my comment here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28948#issuecomment-1888377830. Pinning state might be 483 outbound HTLC (or your `max_accepted_htlc` value) of amount 331 satoshi (dust limit + 1). 483 * 331 = 159k, still less than 440k sats of the targeted HTLC on the valid state. Of course, now the 159k of value can be used as complementary of a honest CPFP to over fee-bump, so I see that more as lowering of the fee-bumping reserves requirements (which is good). Not a solution to the pinning itself, where the pinning lays in the economics being at the advantage of the attacker due to batch pinning.",

So in the interests of narrowing the scope of this PR to make review/discussion easier, I think it would make sense to drop the commits relating to eviction of <=0 fee transactions for now.",

          "body": "Given that the use of a transaction's nVersion is always as an unsigned int, it doesn't make sense to store it as signed and then cast it to unsigned everywhere it is used and displayed.\r\n\r\nSince a few alternative implementations have recently been revealed to have made an error with this signedness that would have resulted in consensus failure, I think it makes sense for us to just make this always unsigned to make it clear that the version is treated as unsigned. This would also help us avoid future potential issues with signedness of this value.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is safe and does not actually change what transactions would or would not be considered both standard and consensus valid. Within consensus, the only use of the version in consensus is in BIP68 validation which was already casting it to uint32_t. Within policy, although it is used as a signed int for the transaction version number check, I do not think that this change would change standardness. Standard transactions are limited to the range [1, 2]. Negative numbers would have fallen under the < 1 condition, but by making it unsigned, they are still non-standard under the > 2 condition.\r\n\r\nUnsigned and signed ints are serialized and unserialized the same way so there is no change in serialization.",

With correctly implemented package relay it doesn't matter that a CPFP tx did a CPFP on top of a commitment transaction that no-one but the originator has: provided the fee (or with RBFR, fee-rate) outbids the competing commitment transaction, it will be replaced as nodes evaluate the new package as a whole.\r\n\r\nI do not believe all these scenarios have been fully tested. But that is at least is the intent to eventually implement this protection.\r\n\r\nWith (one-shot) replace-by-fee-rate while my blog didn't go into explicit detail, when used with CPFP and a package relay implementation, it also should be immune NTA pinning for the same reason (RBFing the commitment transaction itself with fee variants is of course already immune to NTA-specific pinning techniques). Indeed, you should be able to make a RBFR implementation compatible with V3 transactions by simply declaring `nVersion=3` transactions to be standard, without implementing any of the V3 logic.",

      "body": "> so i took time to test a NTA pinning scenario: [ariard/bitcoin@84e12b8](https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/84e12b8) which is known since https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-June/018011.html\r\n\r\nTo summarize the \"network topology aware\" scenario, what happens with Alice and Bob's channel is:\r\n1. Bob broadcasts his commitment transaction + cpfp from his anchor\r\n2. This transaction propagates to everyone except Alice, somehow. [1]\r\n3. Alice broadcasts her commitment transaction + cpfp from her anchor\r\n4. Alice's transactions don't propagate because her commitment tx conflicts with Bob's commitment tx.\r\n\r\nThis (1) requires the attacker to somehow control transaction propagation so that some specific nodes get their transactions and some don't (2) *is* accounted for here. I referenced your post in the original posts, as it's one of the scenarios that requires package RBF.\r\n\r\n> I’m interested if there is a full-branch with package-relay + v3 tx policy available somewhere.\r\n\r\nYes, I wrote this branch a few months ago: https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commits/2023-11-1p1c-v3-ea/\r\nI also included a generic (i.e. not LN-specific) version of this scenario as part of the package RBF + package relay test suite. See the \"[functional test] package RBF network\" commit.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your branch seems to be based on master and use nVersion=2 transactions? Feel free to cherry-pick your test on top of that branch - also be sure to use `submitpackage` instead of `sendrawtransaction`. You can also create a branch with #28984 + #28970 for \"cluster size 2\" package RBF instead of v3-only, but you'd want something like v3 to mitigate package RBF rule 3 pinning (where Bob attaches a huge high fee / low feerate child to `bob_commitment_tx`).\r\n\r\n> I don’t know if it’s robust against NTA pinning\r\n\r\nIf the issue is about `alice_commitment_tx` + `alice_cpfp_on_alice_tx` replacing `bob_commitment_tx`, this proposal (v3 + package RBF + 1p1c package relay) *does* resolve it and is in fact designed primarily for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWe walked through the combinations of transactions that can be broadcast ahead of time by the adversary [here on Delving](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/sibling-eviction-for-v3-transactions/472/4). I understand that you have limited time, but I'd appreciate a bit of effort in checking to see if your concerns have already been addressed.\r\n\r\n[1]: In your test, this is achieved this by manually disconnecting nodes. Since you connect the nodes only after submitting both sets of transactions and they are both normal Bitcoin Core nodes, it is expected that they would not announce prior transactions to each other. This is unrealistic in practice - transactions might not propagate or take a long time, but if attackers can disconnect nodes reliably, we have worse problems. A more realistic way to simulate these scenarios is to submit the below-min-feerate parent to one node only with `prioritisetransaction` (so that it is submitted but not propagated), emulating realistic policy differences that might exist between nodes. You could also put some more nodes in between to add latency, though that might sometimes be flaky.",

      "body": "@glozow\r\n\r\n> To summarize the \"network topology aware\" scenario, what happens with Alice and Bob's channel is:\r\n> \r\n>     1. Bob broadcasts his commitment transaction + cpfp from his anchor\r\n> \r\n>     2. This transaction propagates to everyone except Alice, somehow. [1]\r\n> \r\n>     3. Alice broadcasts her commitment transaction + cpfp from her anchor\r\n> \r\n>     4. Alice's transactions don't propagate because her commitment tx conflicts with Bob's commitment tx.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> This (1) requires the attacker to somehow control transaction propagation so that some specific nodes get their transactions and some don't (2) _is_ accounted for here. I referenced your post in the original posts, as it's one of the scenarios that requires package RBF.\r\n\r\nThis scenario isn't a \"somehow\" one; I've personally seen this scenario happen a few times by accident with LND with commitment transactions that were close to minimum relay fees. Basically, the other side's commitment transaction doesn't get to my node in time, and then my node also published it's commitment transaction + anchor CPFP. The result being that fee bumping didn't work until I manually fixed it by finding an anchor CPFP spend of the other side, and manually publishing it on other nodes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as we both agree, package RBF fixes this.",

      "body": "Updating my concept ACK.  Reading through the numerous comments on this PR, the objections that have been raised have nothing to do with v3, and instead have to do with applications that might use it, and what their best design is.  I think applications are free to optimize further, but this PR is not the place to do spec design of layer 2 protocols. \r\n\r\nThe way I see this issue is that RBF pinning due to the total fee requirement[^1] is a real issue for users, and has been since we first introduced RBF, long before layer 2 protocols were in use.  So the idea that we'd mitigate the issue by instituting some restriction on children is a very old one, and is not unique to a single project (like LN).  However, the particular choice of parameters here -- exactly 1 small child, that is only permitted to have 1 parent -- is indeed an attempt to meet the LN use case.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've had some support from LN spec developers (@t-bast, @thebluematt) for the idea that the v3 rules meet their use case.  The others have been silent so far, so it's not yet clear that v3 will be adopted; but it's also not yet clear that it won't be.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is another issue besides pinning that is relevant -- the CPFP carveout rule.  I brought up in #29319 that in order to eventually be able to deploy cluster mempool without breaking current use cases, we'll need some alternative to the carveout rule.  It sounds like v3 + sibling eviction (proposed in #29306) may be sufficient -- again, we have concept ACKs from @t-bast and @thebluematt and we're waiting to hear from others who have been silent so far. To unblock progress on other work, my suggestion is that we do the following:\r\n- [ ] modify this PR to introduce the v3 policy and validation rules, but not make v3 transactions standard for relay yet -- this should be a very small code change I think\r\n- [ ] merge this PR (once it's been sufficiently re-reviewed and ACKed, of course)\r\n- [ ] continue to develop sibling eviction for v3, and imbued v3 semantics on existing LN transactions (separate PRs we can propose for consideration, which seem like part of a potential roadmap)\r\n- [ ] Once v3 gets sufficient ACKs from the LN community, merge a PR that would enable v3 transactions as standard\r\n\r\nThis also gives us time to make any potential changes to the v3 child size policy rule prior to deployment, if we get feedback from other developers about what numbers are workable (eg perhaps 500vb is better).  And alternatively, if this approach ultimately is nacked by the LN community or proves unworkable altogether, then we can always revert the code introduced here, as the rules would never have been deployed on mainnet.  However, given that this PR is a blocker for many other lines of work right now, I'd like to get this merged in some form so that we can move on to the rest (sibling eviction, cluster-size-2 rbf, 1p1c relay, cluster mempool, etc).\r\n\r\nI've been re-reviewing this PR myself today, and I see that @instagibbs has left a few more comments, and my overall sense is that the code here is pretty well reviewed and tested, and should be ready for merge soon.\r\n\r\n[^1]: Dropping the total fee requirement may be achievable in the future with further research, but there is not currently a well-thought out proposal that would allow us to do this while ensuring incentive compatibility of replacements and a way to prevent free relay on the network.",

      "body": "> To be clear, package relay with package RBF is meant to be resistant to these kinds of network topology aware (NTA) pinning scenarios. With correctly implemented package relay it doesn't matter that a CPFP tx did a CPFP on top of a commitment transaction that no-one but the originator has: provided the fee (or with RBFR, fee-rate) outbids the competing commitment transaction, it will be replaced as nodes evaluate the new package as a whole.\r\n\r\ni’m not sure if the adversary injects malicious package A in target’s mempool, and package B in other network mempools.\r\na v3 parent is not necessarily a LN commitment transaction however CPFP can be in conflict between A / B.\r\nsee the ugly NTA pinning scenario described in my old mail.\r\n\r\n> Yes, I wrote this branch a few months ago: https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commits/2023-11-1p1c-v3-ea/\r\nI also included a generic (i.e. not LN-specific) version of this scenario as part of the package RBF + package relay test suite. See the \"[functional test] package RBF network\" commit.\r\n\r\nthanks interesting to test both NTA and “loophole” pinnings on this branch described earlier to t-bast [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28948#issuecomment-1888377830)\r\n\r\n> If the issue is about alice_commitment_tx + alice_cpfp_on_alice_tx replacing bob_commitment_tx, this proposal (v3 + package RBF + 1p1c package relay) does resolve it and is in fact designed primarily for that purpose.\r\n\r\nsure package relay fixes this, less sure even if you add package RBF if you combine with some leeway given by 1000vb limit\r\n\r\n> Updating my concept ACK. Reading through the numerous comments on this PR, the objections that have been raised  have nothing to do with v3, and instead have to do with applications that might use it, and what their best design is. I think applications are free to optimize further, but this PR is not the place to do spec design of layer 2 protocols.\r\n\r\nno, if we follow this line of reasoning imo it’s like saying it’s okay to have IPsec or TLS shipping with weak crypto primitives\r\nthe objections which have been raised are very related to the v3, at least the 1000vb, see the “loophole” [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28948#issuecomment-1888377830)\r\nsecp256k1 dev are spending amount of time to make its high-level api safe for “dumb” users, we should do the same.\r\n\r\n> So far, we've had some support from LN spec developers (@t-bast, @TheBlueMatt) for the idea that the v3 rules meet their use case. The others have been silent so far, so it's not yet clear that v3 will be adopted; but it's also not yet clear that it won't be.\r\n\r\ni broke enough time LN spec dev stuff to take their technical opinions at their fair prices.\r\n\r\n> Moreover, there is another issue besides pinning that is relevant -- the CPFP carveout rule. I brought up in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29319 that in order to eventually be able to deploy cluster mempool without breaking current use cases, we'll need some alternative to the carveout rule. It sounds like v3 + sibling eviction (proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29306) may be sufficient -- again, we have concept ACKs from @t-bast and @TheBlueMatt and we're waiting to hear from others who have been silent so far. To unblock progress on other work, my suggestion is that we do the following:\r\n\r\nthe CPFP carveout rule can be removed with or without v3, its security benefits quasi-null in my opinion.\r\nsee comment other issues.\r\n\r\n> I've been re-reviewing this PR myself today, and I see that @instagibbs has left a few more comments, and my overall sense is that the code here is pretty well reviewed and tested, and should be ready for merge soon.\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar do you have a lightning node running somewhere on signet (maybe instagibbs has some v3 CLN branch) ?\r\nmy pleasure to try to break it with “loophole” or NTA scenarios, at least try the “loophole” one.\r\nif i or anyone fail to exploit it,  great my pinning concerns are unfounded\r\nif i or succeed to exploit, we'll learn and can think more about anti-pinning mitigations.",

      "body": "@instagibbs\r\n\r\nI maintain your review and the ones of @sdaftuar and @achow101 are lacking professionalism.\r\n\r\nFor a PR which is called \"anti-pinning\" (it's all in the title), there has been no substantial answer on my concerns that it does not address neither rbf rule3 pinning (the 1000 vbyte rule limit offers to give a way, see \"loophole\" scenario exposed above), neither topological-based scenario at the tx-relay network level (NTA one), and that actually \"hard\" limits are a source of \"no-one-fits-all\" bargainging for use-cases operations (as we have seen with `mempoolfullrbf`).\r\n\r\nOn the review process itself and calling to stop using this PR to debate the robustness of the mitigation, this is insulting and a flagrant proof of your lack of system engineering culture. When software engineers are designing new cryptopgraphic primtives or kernel mechanism (e.g linux `cgroups`), they are of course considering how those mechanisms are used by downstream use-cases.\r\n\r\nThe current design and review mentality you're exposing and I understanding you're advocating has been proven multiple times a source of potential security failures (e.g `CVE-2021-31876` or the 1 CSV added on non-anchor outputs commitment transactions as original carve out mechanism semantics were unclear). Beyond, you're falling in the trap of the protocol design process communication silos  I've been pointong out before and I aimed to address in the past with the [\"L2s Onchain Support IRC Workshop\"](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/04/28/#call-for-topics-in-layer-crossing-workshop)\r\n\r\nOn the remark that people who find this useful and want to, they can use it, which I understanding that LN maintainers or anyone else (e.g exchange batching) are free to level up their bitcoin use-cases with nversion=3 semantics. Sadly one has to be very realistic and observe that LN security track record is not great. When you're doing adversarial reviews on financial software you cannot trust the incentives of the developers \"in defense\", as they have always a moral interest to claim attack X or attack Y is \"mitigated\", playing some kind of [security theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater).\r\n\r\nFinally, on the call of approaching feature freeze, this is neither a convicining argument in my eyes. In critical system design, development and maintenance there is a social phenomena called [process fatigue](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/business/what-is-alert-fatigue). Namely, when engineers are getting in front of some deadlines after lengthy work cycles, they are rushing to deliver a technical project, provoking downstream major failure (e.g known historic example is [Space Shuttle Challenger disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster)).\r\n\r\nThere is no magical reason that Bitcoin Core review process is not affected by such phenomena of \"process fatigue\" and as such when there is no review consensus on security-first contribution in one of the part of the codebaee like the mempool, practical wisdom would recommend to delay it to the next release cycle. This is better than yet-another \"poor hot fixes\" in production were we have to mobilize half-of the engineering, vendors and users ecosystem time, and jeopardize their funds.\r\n\r\nTo conclude your answer is a poor one sustaining my precedent accusation of lacking professionalism. You're still free to communicate any example or demonstration infrastructure running with v3 semantics that I can target with demo pinning attacks. And as such back up your Bitcoin Core technical review with your credibility and reputation, in a skin-in-the-game approach.",

          "body": "All the values selected by the transaction issuers are implemented to respect current hard policy limits as of 27.0\r\nBitcoin Core version (e.g `MAX_PACKAGE_COUNT` or `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT`). As such introducing a new distinction in the Bitcoin ecosystem among tx-relay policy checks enforced by full-nodes hosts of a said full-node implementation/version and the the policy-check opt-ed by any transaction or second-layers use-cases. That way any significant on-chain economic  traffic can be still processed by low-performance full-nodes hosts, without altering the DoS profile risks.\r\n\r\nE.g in the context of the Lightning Network, lightning nodes can adjust their pinning risk exposures affecting their channel funds safety differently in function of each lightning topological peers (- assuming the BOLT protocol upgrades its negotiation flow `open_channel` / `accept_channel`). As such lightning peers can enforce a trade-off between their off chain HTLC throughputs and their tx-relay jamming exposure (e.g pinning or RC attacks).\r\n\r\nE.g in the context of collaborative custody management, distrusted stakeholders owning a set of pre-signed set of transactions can all commits to the same set of max tx size / max package limits, as such introducing more reliability on the worst amount of fee-bumping reserves that should be provisioned instead of hard limits like the current approach with v3.\r\n\r\n_Wait ! I’m lost reading this OP ?! Already  too much information, what should I do ? Go to read Bitcoin Optech 10 articles series’s [“Waiting for confirmation: a series about mempool and relay policy”](https://bitcoinops.org/en/blog/waiting-for-confirmation/) as a starter and then come back to read or comment._\r\n\r\nThe opt-in mechanism uses a one bit flag in the nSequence field which is already a standard and consenus Bitcoin transaction field since the genesis block. The mechansim (`ParsePackageTopologicalLimits()`) check that bip68 is disabled to avoid conflicts of semantics, as the remaining nSequence field bits are interpreted as dynamic issuers-selected policy checks (currently implemented ancestor / descendant / max package limits size). The intrusive aspect of the mechanism is minimal and the interpreted field could be uplifted in other parts of standard transaction fields while conserving the same policy check enforcement semantics.\r\n\r\nHere the code excerpt that deserves a `doc/policy/` , a BIP or a banana.\r\n```\r\n (sequence_field & SEQUENCE_ISSUER_SELECTED_LIMITS_DISABLE_FLAG) {\r\n        return std::nullopt;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const uint32_t ancestor_limit = sequence_field & SEQUENCE_ISSUER_SELECTED_ANCESTOR_MASK;\r\n    const uint32_t descendant_limit = sequence_field & SEQUENCE_ISSUER_SELECTED_DESCENDANT_MASK;\r\n    const uint32_t weight_limit = (uint32_t)(sequence_field & SEQUENCE_ISSUER_SELECTED_WEIGHT_MASK)\r\n     << SEQUENCE_ISSUER_SELECTED_WEIGHT_GRANULARITY;\r\n\r\n    // This parsing logic can be adapted for forward-compatibility in matters of issuer-selected\r\n    // policy limits:\r\n    //      - encodes accumulated package SigOpCost\r\n    //      - commit to package-level dynamic DUST_RELAY_TX_FEE or DEFAULT_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE\r\n    //      - opt-in if limits are strict (at the pckg-level) or composable (at the tx-level)\r\n    //        to allow non-interactive composability among N chain of transaction issuers.\r\n\r\n    IssuerSelectedLimits tx_issuer_selected_limits(ancestor_limit, descendant_limit, weight_limit);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssuer-selected fields getting economic popularity and not jeopardizing bitcoin security model and long-term decentralization equlibrium of the ecosystem of peer-to-peer full-nodes and solo mining operations could get a consensus enforcement, going through the traditional consensus design & development process (narrator note: no ones really knows or is sure there is  something as traditional consensus development process...). The nSequence consensus field due to its 32 bits limitation is space limited, even if a lot can be achieved with bit-wise operations.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical philosophy perspective, I think this introduction of issuer-selected transaction / package policy limits checks should should reduce the amount of \"bargaing-on-policy\" we have seen recently with `mempoolfullrbf` (LN-vs-zero-conf-acceptance business) or do-digital-art-on-chain-and-the-posterity-will-say-if-it-is-bansky-or-crap-waste colored coins and tokens experimentations.\r\n\r\nThis patchset built on the v3 patchset and its followups (commit `37fdf5a4`), is already integrated in the package mempool\r\nacceptance code flow. There is 1 logical conflict for now as the 1000 vbytes limit is enforced by default for v3 (which still\r\nexposes a lot of loss of funds risk exposure for some time-sensitive flows like lightning considering \"loophole\" and NTA pinning scenario  - see #28948). In the future, this limit can just become a \"tx issuer-selected policy check\" limit.\r\n\r\nIn the future, such transaction / package “issuer-selected” can be used as a signaling mechanism, e.g for [replace-by-feerate](https://petertodd.org/2024/one-shot-replace-by-fee-rate) dynamic window enforced at the mempool-level, for the use-cases who wishing to ensure their chain of transactions are minimal by not using CPFP.\r\n\r\nFor more discussions on mempool policy technical philosophy design and trade-offs on downstream use-cases, see the old email  thread [\"On mempool consistency\"](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021116.html).\r\n\r\nThis patchset can be applied on top of any fork of bitcoin core 27.0 with the minimal of engineering effort by anyone wishing\r\nto experiment with mempool policy for its use-case (I'll see if I have time to carry this patchset forward as I'm officially in\r\nsabbatical from bitcoin core development taking the sun on the beach just yelling at them when the stuff is broken, we’re all btc investors).",

      "body": "1) This strikes me as a very expensive operation to perform in order to update the mempool for a reorg.  I think we could probably do better by only calculating ancestors or descendants for transactions that are themselves v3, if we decide we need to enforce the v3 rules after a reorg.\r\n\r\n2) With the logic as written, if a v3 parent-child pair (A, B) were to be reorged out and added back to the mempool, and A has some other spend C already in the mempool, then when `ApplyV3Rules()` is invoked on B, it would be selected for removal.  This in turn would prevent A from being mined, if we assume that B's feerate was the reason it was mined in the first place?  This strikes me as unfortunate.\r\n\r\nInstead, I'd suggest that we not bother enforcing the v3 rules on a reorg.  That seems safer than potentially evicting the fee-paying transaction, less CPU work (so reorgs won't be further slowed down by additional processing), and shouldn't materially affect pinning (if miners are reorging out your transactions, trying to minimize RBF pinning with v3 policy isn't really going to help you!).",

Contracting protocols in which transactions are signed by\n+untrusted counterparties before broadcast time, e.g. the Lightning Network (LN), may benefit from\n+opting in to these policies.\n+\n+## V3 Rationale: RBF Pinning Attacks\n+\n+Since contracting transactions are shared between multiple parties and mempool congestion is\n+difficult to predict, [RBF policy](./mempool-replacements.md) restrictions may accidentally allow a\n+malicious party to \"pin\" a transaction, making it impossible or difficult to replace.\n+\n+### \"Rule 3\" Pinning\n+\n+Imagine that counterparties Alice (honest) and Mallory (malicious) have conflicting transactions A\n+and B, respectively.  RBF rules require the replacement transaction pay a higher absolute fee than\n+the aggregate fees paid by all original transactions. This means Mallory may increase the fees\n+required to replace B by:\n+\n+1. Adding transaction(s) that descend from B and pay a feerate too low to fee-bump B through CPFP.\n+   For example, assuming the default descendant size limit is 101KvB and B is 1000vB paying a\n+feerate of 2sat/vB, adding a 100KvB, 2sat/vB child increases the cost to replace B by 200Ksat.\n+\n+2. Adding a high-fee descendant of B that also spends from a large, low-feerate mempool transaction,\n+   C. The child may pay a very large fee but not actually be fee-bumping B if its overall ancestor\n+feerate is still lower than B's individual feerate. For example, assuming the default ancestor size\n+limit is 101KvB, B is 1000vB paying 2sat/vB, and C is 99KvB paying 1sat/vB, adding a 1000vB child of\n+B and C increases the cost to replace B by 101Ksat.\n+\n+### \"Rule 5\" Pinning\n+\n+RBF rules requires that no replacement trigger the removal of more than 100 transactions. This\n+number includes the descendants of the conflicted mempool transactions. Mallory can make it more\n+difficult to replace transactions by attaching lots of descendants to them. For example, if Alice\n+wants to replace 4 transactions and each one has 25 or more descendants, the replacement will be\n+rejected regardless of its fees.\n+\n+## Version 3 Rules\n+\n+All existing standardness rules and policies apply to V3. The following set of additional\n+rules apply to V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A v3 transaction signals replaceability, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee].\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: A V3 transaction can spend outputs from *confirmed* non-V3 transactions.\n+\n+*Note*: This rule is not enforced during reorgs.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction's unconfirmed ancestors must all be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Ensure the ancestor feerate rule does not underestimate a to-be-replaced V3 mempool\n+transaction's incentive compatibility. Imagine the original transaction, A, has a child B and\n+co-parent C (i.e. B spends from A and C). C also has another child, D. B is one of the original\n+transactions and thus its ancestor feerate must be lower than the package's. However, this may be an\n+underestimation because D can bump C without B's help. This is resolved if V3 transactions can only\n+have V3 ancestors, as then C cannot have another child.\n+\n+*Note*: This rule is enforced during reorgs.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed descendant.\n+\n+Also, [CPFP Carve Out](./mempool-limits.md#CPFP-Carve-Out) does not apply to V3 transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+See example #1 in [\"Rule 3\" Pining](#Rule-3-Pinning) section above.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.\n+\n+5. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot have a sigop-adjusted virtual size\n+   larger than 1000vB.",

Contracting protocols in which transactions are signed by\n+untrusted counterparties before broadcast time, e.g. the Lightning Network (LN), may benefit from\n+opting in to these policies.\n+\n+## V3 Rationale: RBF Pinning Attacks\n+\n+Since contracting transactions are shared between multiple parties and mempool congestion is\n+difficult to predict, [RBF policy](./mempool-replacements.md) restrictions may accidentally allow a\n+malicious party to \"pin\" a transaction, making it impossible or difficult to replace.\n+\n+### \"Rule 3\" Pinning\n+\n+Imagine that counterparties Alice (honest) and Mallory (malicious) have conflicting transactions A\n+and B, respectively.  RBF rules require the replacement transaction pay a higher absolute fee than\n+the aggregate fees paid by all original transactions. This means Mallory may increase the fees\n+required to replace B by:\n+\n+1. Adding transaction(s) that descend from B and pay a feerate too low to fee-bump B through CPFP.\n+   For example, assuming the default descendant size limit is 101KvB and B is 1000vB paying a\n+feerate of 2sat/vB, adding a 100KvB, 2sat/vB child increases the cost to replace B by 200Ksat.\n+\n+2. Adding a high-fee descendant of B that also spends from a large, low-feerate mempool transaction,\n+   C. The child may pay a very large fee but not actually be fee-bumping B if its overall ancestor\n+feerate is still lower than B's individual feerate. For example, assuming the default ancestor size\n+limit is 101KvB, B is 1000vB paying 2sat/vB, and C is 99KvB paying 1sat/vB, adding a 1000vB child of\n+B and C increases the cost to replace B by 101Ksat.\n+\n+### \"Rule 5\" Pinning\n+\n+RBF rules requires that no replacement trigger the removal of more than 100 transactions. This\n+number includes the descendants of the conflicted mempool transactions. Mallory can make it more\n+difficult to replace transactions by attaching lots of descendants to them. For example, if Alice\n+wants to replace 4 transactions and each one has 25 or more descendants, the replacement will be\n+rejected regardless of its fees.\n+\n+## Version 3 Rules\n+\n+All existing standardness rules and policies apply to V3. The following set of additional\n+rules apply to V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A v3 transaction signals replaceability, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee].\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: A V3 transaction can spend outputs from *confirmed* non-V3 transactions.\n+\n+*Note*: This rule is not enforced during reorgs.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction's unconfirmed ancestors must all be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Ensure the ancestor feerate rule does not underestimate a to-be-replaced V3 mempool\n+transaction's incentive compatibility. Imagine the original transaction, A, has a child B and\n+co-parent C (i.e. B spends from A and C). C also has another child, D. B is one of the original\n+transactions and thus its ancestor feerate must be lower than the package's. However, this may be an\n+underestimation because D can bump C without B's help. This is resolved if V3 transactions can only\n+have V3 ancestors, as then C cannot have another child.\n+\n+*Note*: This rule is enforced during reorgs.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed descendant.\n+\n+Also, [CPFP Carve Out](./mempool-limits.md#CPFP-Carve-Out) does not apply to V3 transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+See example #1 in [\"Rule 3\" Pining](#Rule-3-Pinning) section above.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.",

Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: A V3 transaction can spend outputs from *confirmed* non-V3 transactions.\n+\n+*Note*: This rule is not enforced during reorgs.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction's unconfirmed ancestors must all be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Ensure the ancestor feerate rule does not underestimate a to-be-replaced V3 mempool\n+transaction's incentive compatibility. Imagine the original transaction, A, has a child B and\n+co-parent C (i.e. B spends from A and C). C also has another child, D. B is one of the original\n+transactions and thus its ancestor feerate must be lower than the package's. However, this may be an\n+underestimation because D can bump C without B's help.

Contracting protocols in which transactions are signed by\n+untrusted counterparties before broadcast time, e.g. the Lightning Network (LN), may benefit from\n+opting in to these policies.\n+\n+## V3 Rationale: RBF Pinning Attacks\n+\n+Since contracting transactions are shared between multiple parties and mempool congestion is\n+difficult to predict, [RBF policy](./mempool-replacements.md) restrictions may accidentally allow a\n+malicious party to \"pin\" a transaction, making it impossible or difficult to replace.\n+\n+### \"Rule 3\" Pinning\n+\n+Imagine that counterparties Alice (honest) and Mallory (malicious) have conflicting transactions A\n+and B, respectively.  RBF rules require the replacement transaction pay a higher absolute fee than\n+the aggregate fees paid by all original transactions. This means Mallory may increase the fees\n+required to replace B by:\n+\n+1. Adding transaction(s) that descend from B and pay a feerate too low to fee-bump B through CPFP.\n+   For example, assuming the default descendant size limit is 101KvB and B is 1000vB paying a\n+feerate of 2sat/vB, adding a 100KvB, 2sat/vB child increases the cost to replace B by 200Ksat.\n+\n+2. Adding a high-fee descendant of B that also spends from a large, low-feerate mempool transaction,\n+   C. The child may pay a very large fee but not actually be fee-bumping B if its overall ancestor\n+feerate is still lower than B's individual feerate. For example, assuming the default ancestor size\n+limit is 101KvB, B is 1000vB paying 2sat/vB, and C is 99KvB paying 1sat/vB, adding a 1000vB child of\n+B and C increases the cost to replace B by 101Ksat.\n+\n+### \"Rule 5\" Pinning\n+\n+RBF rules requires that no replacement trigger the removal of more than 100 transactions. This\n+number includes the descendants of the conflicted mempool transactions. Mallory can make it more\n+difficult to replace transactions by attaching lots of descendants to them. For example, if Alice\n+wants to replace 4 transactions and each one has 25 or more descendants, the replacement will be\n+rejected regardless of its fees.\n+\n+## Version 3 Rules\n+\n+All existing standardness rules and policies apply to V3. The following set of additional\n+rules apply to V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A v3 transaction signals replaceability, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee].\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: A V3 transaction can spend outputs from *confirmed* non-V3 transactions.\n+\n+*Note*: This rule is not enforced during reorgs.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction's unconfirmed ancestors must all be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Ensure the ancestor feerate rule does not underestimate a to-be-replaced V3 mempool\n+transaction's incentive compatibility. Imagine the original transaction, A, has a child B and\n+co-parent C (i.e. B spends from A and C). C also has another child, D. B is one of the original\n+transactions and thus its ancestor feerate must be lower than the package's. However, this may be an\n+underestimation because D can bump C without B's help. This is resolved if V3 transactions can only\n+have V3 ancestors, as then C cannot have another child.\n+\n+*Note*: This rule is enforced during reorgs.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed descendant.\n+\n+Also, [CPFP Carve Out](./mempool-limits.md#CPFP-Carve-Out) does not apply to V3 transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+See example #1 in [\"Rule 3\" Pining](#Rule-3-Pinning) section above.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.",

Contracting protocols in which transactions are signed by\n+untrusted counterparties before broadcast time, e.g. the Lightning Network (LN), may benefit from\n+opting in to these policies.\n+\n+## V3 Rationale: RBF Pinning Attacks\n+\n+Since contracting transactions are shared between multiple parties and mempool congestion is\n+difficult to predict, [RBF policy](./mempool-replacements.md) restrictions may accidentally allow a\n+malicious party to \"pin\" a transaction, making it impossible or difficult to replace.\n+\n+### \"Rule 3\" Pinning\n+\n+Imagine that counterparties Alice (honest) and Mallory (malicious) have conflicting transactions A\n+and B, respectively.  RBF rules require the replacement transaction pay a higher absolute fee than\n+the aggregate fees paid by all original transactions. This means Mallory may increase the fees\n+required to replace B by:\n+\n+1. Adding transaction(s) that descend from B and pay a feerate too low to fee-bump B through CPFP.\n+   For example, assuming the default descendant size limit is 101KvB and B is 1000vB paying a\n+feerate of 2sat/vB, adding a 100KvB, 2sat/vB child increases the cost to replace B by 200Ksat.\n+\n+2. Adding a high-fee descendant of B that also spends from a large, low-feerate mempool transaction,\n+   C. The child may pay a very large fee but not actually be fee-bumping B if its overall ancestor\n+feerate is still lower than B's individual feerate. For example, assuming the default ancestor size\n+limit is 101KvB, B is 1000vB paying 2sat/vB, and C is 99KvB paying 1sat/vB, adding a 1000vB child of\n+B and C increases the cost to replace B by 101Ksat.\n+\n+### \"Rule 5\" Pinning\n+\n+RBF rules requires that no replacement trigger the removal of more than 100 transactions. This\n+number includes the descendants of the conflicted mempool transactions. Mallory can make it more\n+difficult to replace transactions by attaching lots of descendants to them. For example, if Alice\n+wants to replace 4 transactions and each one has 25 or more descendants, the replacement will be\n+rejected regardless of its fees.\n+\n+## Version 3 Rules\n+\n+All existing standardness rules and policies apply to V3. The following set of additional\n+rules apply to V3 transactions:\n+\n+1. A v3 transaction signals replaceability, even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. Other\n+   conditions apply, see [RBF rules](./mempool-replacements.md) and [Package RBF\n+rules][./packages.md#Package-Replace-By-Fee].\n+\n+2. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Combined with Rule 1, this gives us the property of \"inherited signaling\" when\n+descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created. Additionally, checking whether a transaction\n+signals replaceability this way does not require mempool traversal, and does not change based on\n+what transactions are mined.\n+\n+*Note*: A V3 transaction can spend outputs from *confirmed* non-V3 transactions.\n+\n+*Note*: This rule is not enforced during reorgs.\n+\n+3. A V3 transaction's unconfirmed ancestors must all be V3.\n+\n+*Rationale*: Ensure the ancestor feerate rule does not underestimate a to-be-replaced V3 mempool\n+transaction's incentive compatibility. Imagine the original transaction, A, has a child B and\n+co-parent C (i.e. B spends from A and C). C also has another child, D. B is one of the original\n+transactions and thus its ancestor feerate must be lower than the package's. However, this may be an\n+underestimation because D can bump C without B's help. This is resolved if V3 transactions can only\n+have V3 ancestors, as then C cannot have another child.\n+\n+*Note*: This rule is enforced during reorgs.\n+\n+4. A V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 unconfirmed descendant.\n+\n+Also, [CPFP Carve Out](./mempool-limits.md#CPFP-Carve-Out) does not apply to V3 transactions.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (upper bound) the larger the descendant limit, the more transactions may need to be\n+replaced. This is a problematic pinning attack, i.e., a malicious counterparty prevents the\n+transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping.\n+See example #1 in [\"Rule 3\" Pining](#Rule-3-Pinning) section above.\n+\n+*Rationale*: (lower bound) at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP of the presigned\n+transaction. The contract protocol can create presigned transactions paying 0 fees and 1 output for\n+attaching a CPFP at broadcast time (\"anchor output\"). Without package RBF, multiple anchor outputs\n+would be required to allow each counterparty to fee-bump any presigned transaction. With package\n+RBF, since the presigned transactions can replace each other, 1 anchor output is sufficient.",

In that way, this function kind of assumes that `package` is a connected component.\r\n\r\nIf `package` has unrelated transactions, we'd let a mempool sibling slip through in this function. However, since we are calling `ApplyV3Rules` within `PreChecks`, the mempool sibling is caught there. So I guess the \"not strictly necessary in package validation\" is not really correct for our \"testmempoolaccept is allowed to have unrelated transactions\" use case.",

C2 can be arbitrarily big, since it entered the mempool with no unconfirmed parents.\r\n\r\nP is reorged out, and now P, C1, and C2 are all in the mempool.\r\n\r\nSuppose D is an RBF of C1 that would pass our RBF rules.  However, C2 is a big transaction, and being forced to conflict with C2 (eg due to sibling eviction or whatever) might make D fail, even though the mempool would be strictly improved by just letting D replace C1, and leaving C2 in place.\r\n\r\nAnyway I don't think this edge case behavior is super important, but if we have to pick something, I think what is implemented here is probably right.",
