The value wasn't forwarded to libsecp as a user might have reasonably expected.\r\n3. We now have the DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_SHA256 define which is what disable-asm actually did in practice.\r\n\r\nIf there is any desire, we can hook DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_SHA256 up to a new configure option that actually does what it says.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this is one of the last (THE last?) remaining uses of autoconf defines in our crypto code. As such it seems like low-hanging fruit.",

Regardless of the setting,\n   asm is used in random.cpp and support/cleanse.cpp.\n2. The value wasn't forwarded to libsecp as a user might have reasonably\n   expected.\n3. We now have the DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_SHA256 define which is what disable-asm\n   actually did in practice.\n\nIf there is any desire, we can hook DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_SHA256 up to a new\nconfigure option that actually does what it says.",

The option does indeed currently pass through to secp, so that bullet-point in my commit message is wrong and I'll update it.\r\n\r\nSorry for the back-and-forth, but I confused myself here. `--disable-asm` doesn't have any effect on libsecp, but `--without-asm` does. No need to update the PR description.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> It still forwards just fine with our option removed though, so I don't think that changes anything here.\r\n\r\nI got this wrong but it still accidentally made sense, heh. To be clear, passing `--without-asm` will still do the same as before, which is to disable asm-optimized libsecp without affecting Core at all. It was never \"forwarded\" in the sense that we interpreted and copied it to libsecp, rather it passed through untouched and still will.\r\n\r\nAll that confusion just seems like more justification for removal imo :)",
