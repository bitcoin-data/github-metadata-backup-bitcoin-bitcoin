    "body": "Disable `clang-analyzer-core.UndefinedBinaryOperatorResult` warning because it produces a false positive in a Cap'n Proto header:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n/usr/include/kj/async-inl.h:609:37: warning: The left operand of '+' is a garbage value [clang-analyzer-core.UndefinedBinaryOperatorResult]\r\n  609 |       return *(void**)(*(char**)obj + voff);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was reported by fanquake in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33256 and was previously addressed in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/184/commits/76313450c2c4aa70cf5c443dc2b33c621a565fb5 which changed the analyzer result to be a warning instead of an error. PR https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/pull/2334 was also merged upstream to prevent this in future versions of Cap'n Proto.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it does not seem possible suppress the false-positive warning from this header without turning off the check for bitcoin code as well. The header is included with `-isystem` so it is treated as a third party header, but clang-tidy has a longstanding issue discussed in https://reviews.llvm.org/D26418 where it ignores `-isystem` and ignores `HeaderFilterRegex` and `ExcludeHeaderFilterRegex` directives if it decides that errors are associated with the \"main file\" of the translation unit, which is the case here. (See `isInMainFile` in https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/91400/files)\r\n\r\nThe tidy error is a false positive from clang-analyzer (https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/) warning that the vtable pointer `*(char**)obj` is a garbage value rather than a valid memory address. The analyzer has no way of knowing it could be a valid address since it's only valid due to assumptions about the ABI.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the code is to get a starting function address that can be passed to addr2line from a lambda or function object. The function `GetFunctorStartAddress` calls a helper `PtmfHelper::apply` to get the starting function address from a pointer-to-member-function value pointing at the operator() method. The helper needs to handle virtual methods, so it checks if the pointer is virtual by testing its low-order bit, and if set, assumes the first bytes of the object are a vtable pointer, and does pointer arithmetic with the vtable address. Clang-tidy complains about this because it does not know the vtable address is valid, assuming incorrectly it is a \"garbage value\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).",

PR\nhttps://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/pull/2334 was also merged upstream to\nprevent this in future versions of Cap'n Proto.\n\nUnfortunately it does not seem possible suppress the false-positive warning\nfrom this header without turning off the check for bitcoin code as well. The\nheader included with -isystem so it is treated as a third party header, but\nclang-tidy has a longstanding issue discussed in\nhttps://reviews.llvm.org/D26418 where it ignores -isystem and ignores\nHeaderFilterRegex and ExcludeHeaderFilterRegex directives if it decides that\nerrors are associated with the \"main file\" of the translation unit, which is\nthe case here. (See \"isInMainFile\" in\nhttps://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/91400/files)\n\nThe tidy error is a false positive from clang-analzyer\n(https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/) warning that the vtable pointer\n`*(char**)obj` is a garbage value rather than a valid memory address. The\nanalyzer has no way of knowing it could be a valid address since it's only\nvalid due to assumptions about the ABI.\n\nThe purpose of the code is to get a starting function address that can be\npassed to addr2line from a lambda or function object. The function\n`GetFunctorStartAddress` calls a helper `PtmfHelper::apply` to get the starting\nfunction address from a pointer-to-member-function value pointing at the\noperator() method. The helper needs to handle virtual methods, so it checks if\nthe pointer is virtual by testing its low-order bit, and if set, assumes the\nfirst bytes of the object are a vtable pointer, and does pointer arithmetic\nwith the vtable address. Clang-tidy complains about this because it does not\nknow the vtable address is valid, assuming incorrectly it is a \"garbage value\".",
