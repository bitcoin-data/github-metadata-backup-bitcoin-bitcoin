    "body": "## Rationale\r\n\r\n### Verifying block templates (no PoW)\r\n\r\nStratum v2 allows miners to generate their own block template. Pools may wish (or need) to verify these templates. This typically involves comparing mempools, asking miners to providing missing transactions and then reconstructing the proposed block.[^0] This is not sufficient to ensure a proposed block is actually valid. In some schemes miners could take advantage of incomplete validation[^1].\r\n\r\nThe Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI), currently the only Stratum v2 implementation, collects all missing mempool transactions, but does not yet fully verify the block.[^2] There's currently no way for it to do so, short of re-implementing Bitcoin Core validation code.\r\n\r\n(although SRI could use this PR, the Template Provider role doesn't need it, so this is _not_ part of #31098)\r\n\r\n### Verifying weak blocks (reduced PoW)\r\n\r\nStratum v2 decentralises block template generation, but still hinge on a centralised entity to approve these templates.\r\n\r\nThere used to be a decentralised mining protocol P2Pool[^3] which relied on (what we would today call) weak blocks. In such a system all participants perform verification and there is no privileged pool operator (that can reject a template).\r\n\r\n> P2Pool shares form a \"sharechain\" with each share referencing the previous share's hash. Each share contains a standard Bitcoin block header, some P2Pool-specific data that is used to compute the generation transaction (total subsidy, payout script of this share, a nonce, the previous share's hash, and _the current target for shares_), and a Merkle branch linking that generation transaction to the block header's Merkle hash.\r\n\r\nIIUC only the header and coinbase of these shares / weak blocks were distributed amongst all pool participants and verified. This was sufficient at the time because fees were negligible, so payouts could simply be distributed based on work.\r\n\r\nHowever, if P2Pool were to be resurrected today[^5], it would need to account for fees in a similar manner as PPLNS[^1] above. In that case the share chain should include the full weak blocks[^7]. The client software would need a way to verify those weak blocks.\r\n\r\nA similar argument applies to [Braidpool](https://github.com/braidpool/braidpool).\r\n\r\n## Enter `checkblock` and its IPC counterpart `checkBlock()`\r\n\r\nGiven a serialised block, it performs the same checks as `submitblock`, but without updating the block index, chainstate, etc. The proof-of-work check can be bypassed entirely, for the first use of verifying block templates. Alternatively a custom `target` can be provided for the use case of weak blocks.\r\n\r\nWhen called with `check_pow=false` the `checkblock` RPC  is (almost) the same as `getblocktemplate` in `proposal` mode, and indeed they both call `checkBlock()` on the Mining interface.\r\n\r\nImplementation details:\r\n\r\nBuilds on:\r\n- [x] #31581\r\n- [ ] #31583\r\n\r\nThe `ChainstateManager::CheckNewBlock()` implementation is based on `ProcessNewBlock()`, but refactored in a number of ways (see https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/75 for previous incarnations):\r\n\r\n- it drops the use of a `StateCatcher`\r\n- it requires building (directly) on the tip\r\n- if calls `CheckWeakProofOfWork` before the other checks\r\n- instead of `AcceptBlock()` it performs a (documented) subset of that function\r\n- it creates a throwaway `CCoinsViewCache` on top of the tip on which it connects the block (needed for full transaction verification)\r\n- it updates validation caches (and does not delete them). This should make subsequent validation (of a real block) faster if it contains overlapping transactions that are not in our mempool.\r\n\r\nThis `CheckNewBlock()` method is then called from the Mining interface `createBlock()` method. This in turn is called from the RPC `checkblock` code, which is a simplified clone of `submitblock`.\r\n\r\nThis method ended up being very similar to `TestBlockValidity`, so the last commit replaces the latter entirely (renaming `CheckNewBlock`).\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a simple unit test and a more elaborate functional test.\r\n\r\nPotential followups:\r\n- if the block contains \"better\" transactions, (optionally) add them to our mempool [^5]\r\n- keep track of non-standard transactions[^6]\r\n- allow rollback (one or two blocks) for pools to verify stale work / uncles\r\n\r\n[^0]: https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/06-Job-Declaration-Protocol.md  \r\n[^1]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/pplns-with-job-declaration/1099/45?u=sjors\r\n[^2]: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/blob/v1.1.0/roles/jd-server/src/lib/job_declarator/message_handler.rs#L196\r\n[^3]: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/P2Pool\r\n[^4]: I know some people are contemplating this and I'm somewhat optimistic that it can be done. In any case the additional complexity in this PR to support weak blocks is trivial.\r\n[^5]: this improves compact block relay once the real block comes in\r\n[^6]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/second-look-at-weak-blocks/805\r\n[^7]: The share chain client software could use compact block encoding to reduce its orphan / uncle rate. To make that easier, we could provide a `reconstructblock` RPC (`reconstructBlock` IPC) that takes the header and short ids, fills in a `CBlock` from the mempool (and jail) and returns a list of missing items. The share chain client then goes and fetches missing items and calls the method again. It then passes the complete block to `checkblock`. This avoids the need for others to fully implement compact block relay. Note that even if we implemented p2p weak block relay, it would not be useful for share chain clients, because they need to relay additional pool-specific data.",

This would give weak block systems more flexibility on how to derive their difficulty.\r\n\r\nI'd be in favor of this. It's more flexible, could prevent interface churn, and if the user wishes to create the custom target from a simple multiplication they could do the multiplication on their end.",

In order to make this easier to implement and test, I also introduced a `gettarget` RPC and `DeriveTarget()` helper.\r\n\r\nI then dropped the original `TestBlockValidity` and renamed `CheckNewBlock` to it. The `generateblock` and `getblocktemplate` RPC calls, as well\r\nas `BlockAssembler::CreateNewBlock` use the new method.\r\n\r\nIf people prefer I could rewrite the git history to directly refactor `TestBlockValidity`, though I suspect the current approach is easier to review.\r\n\r\nI split the test changes out into #31581, so will mark this PR as draft for now. While working on that I noticed a rather big difference between the original `TestBlockValidity` and my incarnation of it: the former required holding `cs_main`, which I think was wrong.",

I also cherry-picked the latest relevant commits from #31583.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr I dropped DATUM from the description, since there's still no spec it's hard to understand what it actually does.\r\n\r\nThe `checkblock` RPC is indeed almost the same as `getblocktemplate` in `proposal` mode. I updated the description to point this out. The main difference is that it can check (reduced) proof-of-work.\r\n\r\nMy long term goal for this new method is to make it more powerful. It could optionally add new transactions to the mempool to improve compact block relay. It could perform small reorgs to validate forks, which can be useful for (stale) share accounting (and perhaps uncle and DAG schemes).\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach could be drop the `checkblock` RPC and leave (weak) PoW checking as an IPC-only feature. If people prefer that I can convert the tests in `rpc_checkblock.py` to instead increase coverage for `getblocktemplate`.\r\n\r\nBut I think it's nice to offer weak block checking support for mining pool projects that want to experiment with it, without forcing them to use IPC. The new RPC method is short and test covered.\r\n\r\n(in the above I'm assuming that `getblocktemplate` should be considered more or less ossified)",
