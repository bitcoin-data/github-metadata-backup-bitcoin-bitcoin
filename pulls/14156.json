    "body": "This PR makes explicit the now implicit conversion constructor `CTransaction(const CMutableTransaction&)` in `transaction.h`. \r\nMinimal changes were made elsewhere to make the code compilable. I'll follow up with other PRs to address individually refactoring functions that should have a `CMutableTransaction` version, or where a `CTransaction` should be reused. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for this change is:\r\n\r\n - Conversion constructors should not be explicit unless there's a strong reason for it (in the opinion of, for example, https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html, and https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Ro-conversion. Let me know your take on this).\r\n - This particular conversion is very costly -- it implies a serialization plus hash of the transaction.\r\n - Even though `CTransaction` and `CMutableTransaction` represent the same data, they have very different use cases and performance properties.\r\n - Making it explicit allows for easier reasoning of performance trade-offs.\r\n - There has been previous performance issues caused by unneeded use of this implicit conversion.\r\n - This PR creates a map for places to look for possible refactoring and performance gains (this benefit still holds if the PR is not merged).",

This patch set does only that, leaving related features for other PRs.\r\n\r\n * it changes the min tx fee to 200 s/kvB, and the incremental relay fee to 100 s/B\r\n * it leaves wallet min fee and incremental fee at 1000 s/kvB and 5000 s/kvB for compatibility while the network upgrades\r\n * it changes the functional tests that are written assuming 1000s/kvB as the min fee levels to explicitly set that via command line parameter\r\n\r\nThere's a bit more of an explanation for some of the choices in the individual commit messages.\r\n\r\nRelated PRs:\r\n\r\n * #13987 -- report minfee in getpeerinfo. useful to observe if your peers have lowered their min relay fees\r\n * #13988 -- settxfee checks. this is useful since currently settxfee to the minrelaytxfee works fine, but with a lower minrelaytxfee, settxfee will be ignored for the range of values between minrelaytxfee and mintxfee which can be confusing\r\n * #13990 -- fix fee estimation to work with lower fees; currently fee estimation won't give estimates lower than 1000 satoshi per kilobyte.",

It doesn't make sense to have more than 1 iteration per eval, because the speed per coin as part of a large flush is a more relevant metric then how often you can flush 1 coin. At the same time I didn't want the benches to use up too much  RAM if someone sets `-scaling` to high number.\r\n\r\nTo test a bigger cache increase `N_CACHE_SCALE=1`. The cache is about 40 MB by default, try `N_CACHE_SCALE=100` for more realistic scenarios, but note that test needs ~3x RAM.\r\n\r\nI'm doing a few things the bench framework doesn't seem designed for. Would like some feedback before I refactor it in the wrong direction:\r\n\r\n- [ ] share code with test framework (should support `--disable-test`?)\r\n- [ ] clean up stuff between evals; e.g. I need to reset the coin cache for `CCoinsViewCacheAddCoinFresh` and `CCoinsViewCacheFlush`\r\n- [ ] disable scaling iterations\r\n- [ ] add a memory-scaling argument\r\n- [ ] allow pausing the clock between iterations; e.g. to generate test coins on the fly rather in bulk before the run ",

Additionally, because SRD uses effective values, the previous fee increasing loop thing is now removed and effective value is used everywhere.\r\n\r\nSome tests may fail spuriously because they may rely on semi-deterministic behavior from the original coin selection algorithm. I have been able to fix the ones that fail the most, but others may still have issues. Please let me know if you see any tests fail for coin selection reasons (e.g. insufficient funds, missing inputs, etc.) and I will try to fix them.\r\n\r\nI will be working on doing simulations this week and will post the data once I finish them.",

Then derive `class CTransaction` from `CPureTransaction`\r\n* Deduce a `CPureBlock` which references `CPureTransactions` in its `vtx`.\r\n\r\nDeserialization now only takes 14% of the wall clock time it took previously on my machine. You can check locally with:\r\n```\r\n./bench_bitcoin --filter=DeserializeBlockTest && ./bench_bitcoin --filter=DeserializePureBlockTest\r\n```\r\nSending a single historic block now takes slightly less (90% of the wall clock time it took previously) on a local network.

          "body": "This PR is the last in a chain of PRs (#14437, #14711, and #15288) that make the wallet code access node state through an abstract [`Chain`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/wipc-sep/src/interfaces/chain.h) class in [`src/interfaces/`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/wipc-sep/src/interfaces) instead of using global variables like `cs_main`, `chainActive`, and `g_connman`. After this PR, wallet code no longer accesses global variables declared outside the wallet directory, and no longer calls functions accessing those globals (as verified by the `hide-globals` script in #10244).\r\n\r\nThis PR and the previous PRs have been refactoring changes that do not affect behavior. Previous PRs have consisted of lots of mechanical changes like:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    wtx.nTimeReceived = GetAdjustedTime();\r\n+    wtx.nTimeReceived = m_chain->getAdjustedTime();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller, but less mechanical. It replaces last few bits of wallet code that access node state directly (through `CValidationInterface`, `CRPCTable`, and `CCoinsViewMemPool` interfaces) with code that uses the `Chain` interface.\r\n\r\nThese changes allow followup PR #10102 (multiprocess gui & wallet PR) to work without any significant updates to wallet code. Additionally they:\r\n\r\n* Provide a single place to describe the interface between wallet and node code.\r\n* Can make better wallet testing possible, because the `Chain` object consists of virtual methods that can be overloaded for mocking. (This could be used to test edge cases in the rescan code, for example).",

          "body": "This PR is re-submission of #14156, which was automatically closed by github (glitch?)\r\n\r\nOriginal description: \r\n\r\nThis PR makes explicit the now implicit conversion constructor `CTransaction(const CMutableTransaction&)` in `transaction.h`. \r\nMinimal changes were made elsewhere to make the code compilable. I'll follow up with other PRs to address individually refactoring functions that should have a `CMutableTransaction` version, or where a `CTransaction` should be reused. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for this change is:\r\n\r\n - Conversion constructors should not be explicit unless there's a strong reason for it (in the opinion of, for example, https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html, and https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Ro-conversion. Let me know your take on this).\r\n - This particular conversion is very costly -- it implies a serialization plus hash of the transaction.\r\n - Even though `CTransaction` and `CMutableTransaction` represent the same data, they have very different use cases and performance properties.\r\n - Making it explicit allows for easier reasoning of performance trade-offs.\r\n - There has been previous performance issues caused by unneeded use of this implicit conversion.\r\n - This PR creates a map for places to look for possible refactoring and performance gains (this benefit still holds if the PR is not merged).",
