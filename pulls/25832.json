    "body": "This adds five new tracepoints with documentation and tests for network connections:\r\n\r\n- established connections with `net:inbound_connection` and `net:outbound_connection`\r\n- closed connections (both closed by us or by the peer) with `net:closed_connnection`\r\n- inbound connections that we choose to evict with `net:evicted_inbound_connection`\r\n- connections that are misbehaving and punished with `net:misbehaving_connection`\r\n\r\nI've been using these tracepoints for a few months now to monitor connection lifetimes, re-connection frequency by IP and netgroup, misbehavior, peer discouragement, and eviction and more. Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, message='getdata message size = 50001'\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",

Tracepoint placement looks good, so do tests. Successfully ran functional tests and the demo script.\r\n\r\nSome points:\r\n- Any reason why only `inbound_connection` and `outbound_connection` explicitly cast all arguments in the demo script?\r\n- I think some of the format specifiers in the demo script are lightly off, leading to outputs with negative netgroup values on my system. I believe it should be  `%lld` for int64 and `%llu` for uint64.\r\n- As [brought up previously](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832#discussion_r1143291078), it would be nice to switch from `nKeyedNetGroup` to netgroup ids that are consistent over time",

The tests in this PR have been updated to match the changes in these PRs. \r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832#discussion_r1143291078: I've dropped `nKeyedNetGroup` from all tracepoints and didn't add a `GetGroup()` call. The net group can be calculated from the passed address. Passing `NetGroupManager::GetGroup()` seems impractical as it's a `std::vector<unsigned char>`.\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832#discussion_r1152094594: Renamed `evicted_connection` to `evicted_inbound_connection` to clarify that this only covers inbound evictions. Outbound eviction is happening in multiple places in `net_processsing.cpp` and would need multiple tracepoints. If needed, these can be added in a separate pull-request.\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832#discussion_r1144475716: using `Ticks<std::chrono::seconds>(m_connected);` now\r\n- adapted the bpftrace demo script and tested with bpftrace v0.18",

The internal enumeration is likely stable enough to warrant being a (semi-)stable interface.\r\n\r\nI tend to agree. A few toughs:\r\n- Mapping the internal Network enum to other values makes it harder to go from tracepoint output/observation to Bitcoin Core internals again\r\n- Using a third (1. `Network` enum, 2. BIP155) protocol \"BIP155 extended for tracepoint interface to handle Bitcoin Core internal values not present in BIP155\" seems weird, confusing, and not worth it (?). If mapping to BIP155 would have been more straight forward, I'd have been happy to use it.\r\n- Personally, I'd favor to avoid changes/functions (like `ConnectedThroughBIP155Network()`, making `GetBIP155Network()` public) that are only used by or useful for tracepoints.\r\n- The tracepoint interface will inherently expose internals. It won't ever be stable in a way the RPC interface is stable. If we remove or refactor something, the affected tracepoints will need to change. This happened in the past with, for example, removing the misbehaving score (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832#issuecomment-2182585453) after https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29575 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31122#discussion_r1820876152.  If the internals change, the tracepoints and their interface needs to change too. Though, this could be better documented in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tracing.md#semi-stable-api \r\n\r\nUnless there are strong opinions on needing a follow up, I'll plan to leave this as is.\r\n",

I think the string is closer to what users need. However, not opposing to add the binary if there's need.\r\n- `nKeyedNetGroup`: I added the netgroup as argument to better identify connections coming from the same network. For my use-case, it's not problematic if `nKeyedNetGroup` isn't consistent across restarts and doesn't have a meaning besides being an ID. I had a quick look at `NetGroupManager::GetGroup()`. This looks like a good alternative to `nKeyedNetGroup` as consumers can choose to decode it if they want.  I plan to play around with it a bit to see if it works.",

That is - could it copy `MAX_PEER_ADDR_LENGTH` from the input to the output and leave it like that? If yes, would that be a problem - a string without a terminating `'\\0'`?",

This generally seems to be the better suited methodology here. I'll use that for the changes in this PR.

If yes, would that be a problem - a string without a terminating '\\0'?\r\n\r\nI think, for us, in this test here, this isn't a problem. The Python ctype mapping for `Connection` defined [below](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832/commits/3c16937f66523e92eb81afacff285fdab80e2e48#diff-e4179f6d1b7cda2cccb1b611452a520817d2d94a8c3f86f00ede8e3dd03b0b61R113-R119) has the same size for an address (`(\"addr\", ctypes.c_char * MAX_PEER_ADDR_LENGTH)`).\r\n\r\n",
