    "body": "This adds five new tracepoints with documentation and tests for network connections:\r\n\r\n- established connections with `net:inbound_connection` and `net:outbound_connection`\r\n- closed connections (both closed by us or by the peer) with `net:closed_connnection`\r\n- inbound connections that we choose to evict with `net:evicted_inbound_connection`\r\n- connections that are misbehaving and punished with `net:misbehaving_connection`\r\n\r\nI've been using these tracepoints for a few months now to monitor connection lifetimes, re-connection frequency by IP and netgroup, misbehavior, peer discouragement, and eviction and more. Together with the two existing P2P message tracepoints they allow for a good overview of local P2P network activity. Also sort-of addresses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22006#discussion_r636775863. \r\n\r\nI've been back and forth on which arguments to include. For example, `net:evicted_connection` could also include some of the eviction metrics like e.g. `last_block_time`, `min_ping_time`, ... but I've left them out for now. If wanted, this can be added here or in a follow-up. I've tried to minimize a potential performance impact by measuring executed instructions with `gdb` where possible (method described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23724#issuecomment-996919963)). I don't think a few hundred extra instructions are too crucial, as connection opens/closes aren't too frequent (compared to e.g. P2P messages).   Note: e.g. `CreateNodeFromAcceptedSocket()` usually executes between 80k and 90k instructions for each new inbound connection.\r\n\r\n| tracepoint                 \t| instructions                                           \t|\r\n|----------------------------\t|--------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| net:inbound_connection     \t| 390 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:outbound_connection    \t| between 700 and 1000 ins                                     \t|\r\n| net:closed_connnection     \t| 473 ins                                                \t|\r\n| net:evicted_inbound_connection     \t| not measured; likely similar to net:closed_connnection \t|\r\n| net:misbehaving_connection | not measured                                           \t|\r\n\r\nAlso added a bpftrace (tested with v0.14.1) `log_p2p_connections.bt` example script that produces output similar to:\r\n```\r\nAttaching 6 probes...\r\nLogging opened, closed, misbehaving, and evicted P2P connections\r\nOUTBOUND conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, total_out=1\r\nINBOUND conn from 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, total_in=1\r\nMISBEHAVING conn id=1, message='getdata message size = 50001'\r\nCLOSED conn to 127.0.0.1:15287: id=0, type=block-relay-only, network=0, established=1231006505\r\nEVICTED conn to 127.0.0.1:45324: id=1, type=inbound, network=0, established=1612312312\r\n```",

Tracepoint placement looks good, so do tests. Successfully ran functional tests and the demo script.\r\n\r\nSome points:\r\n- Any reason why only `inbound_connection` and `outbound_connection` explicitly cast all arguments in the demo script?\r\n- I think some of the format specifiers in the demo script are lightly off, leading to outputs with negative netgroup values on my system. I believe it should be  `%lld` for int64 and `%llu` for uint64.\r\n- As [brought up previously](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832#discussion_r1143291078), it would be nice to switch from `nKeyedNetGroup` to netgroup ids that are consistent over time",

The tests in this PR have been updated to match the changes in these PRs. \r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832#discussion_r1143291078: I've dropped `nKeyedNetGroup` from all tracepoints and didn't add a `GetGroup()` call. The net group can be calculated from the passed address. Passing `NetGroupManager::GetGroup()` seems impractical as it's a `std::vector<unsigned char>`.\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832#discussion_r1152094594: Renamed `evicted_connection` to `evicted_inbound_connection` to clarify that this only covers inbound evictions. Outbound eviction is happening in multiple places in `net_processsing.cpp` and would need multiple tracepoints. If needed, these can be added in a separate pull-request.\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832#discussion_r1144475716: using `Ticks<std::chrono::seconds>(m_connected);` now\r\n- adapted the bpftrace demo script and tested with bpftrace v0.18",

I think the string is closer to what users need. However, not opposing to add the binary if there's need.\r\n- `nKeyedNetGroup`: I added the netgroup as argument to better identify connections coming from the same network. For my use-case, it's not problematic if `nKeyedNetGroup` isn't consistent across restarts and doesn't have a meaning besides being an ID. I had a quick look at `NetGroupManager::GetGroup()`. This looks like a good alternative to `nKeyedNetGroup` as consumers can choose to decode it if they want.  I plan to play around with it a bit to see if it works.",
