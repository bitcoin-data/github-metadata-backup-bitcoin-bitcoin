We get clearer visibility into what currently lies in consensus codepaths **and** what depends on our consensus engine\r\n> 1. We can coalesce duplicate consensus initialization codepaths, mitigating against bugs that arise out of test/non-test initialization inconsistencies\r\n\r\n### De-globalizing `g_chainman`\r\n\r\nExcerpt from #20049\r\n> In order to modularize our consensus engine, we need to first de-globalize the global `ChainstateManager` -- namely `g_chainman` -- as it and its dependencies are what makes up the bulk of our consensus engine. A few direct references to `g_chainman` have already been removed in #19927, however, its indirect uses (mainly via `::Chain(state|)Active()`) are numerous in our codebase and often used to ~~cheat~~ avoid obtaining a `ChainstateManager` reference.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis changeset moves the global `ChainstateManger` to `NodeContext` and removes `::Chain{state,}Active()` as a first step towards better modularization of our consensus engine. \r\n\r\nThe commits are ordered as such:\r\n1. Fixes to our existing codebase crucial to subsequent changes in this changeset\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...dongcarl:2020-10-chainman-fixes\r\n1. Remove all references to `g_chainman`, `::Chain{state,}Active()`\r\n\t1. In `src/validation.{cpp,h}`\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions related to `::LookupBlockIndex` in the call graph\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/2020-10-chainman-fixes...dongcarl:2020-09-libbitcoinruntime-v4\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions that are mempool-related\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/dongcarl:2020-09-libbitcoinruntime-v4...2020-09-reduce-validation-mempool-ccsactiveglobal-usage\r\n\t\t1. In a bundle of functions which do not belong in previous bundles\r\n\t\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/2020-09-reduce-validation-mempool-ccsactiveglobal-usage...dongcarl:2020-09-reduce-validation-ccsactiveglobal-usage\r\n\t1. In \"validation-adjacent\" modules of the codebase\r\n\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/dongcarl:2020-09-reduce-validation-ccsactiveglobal-usage...2020-09-libbitcoinruntime-v6\r\n\t\t1. In `src/txmempool.cpp`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/miner.cpp`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/node`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/net_processing.cpp`\r\n\t1.

In `src/rest.cpp`\r\n\t1. In auxiliary modules of the codebase\r\n\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/dongcarl:2020-10-libbitcoinruntime-v7...2020-10-libbitcoinruntime-v8\r\n\t\t1. In `src/bench`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/index`\r\n\t1. In initialization codepaths and tests\r\n\thttps://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/compare/2020-10-libbitcoinruntime-v8...dongcarl:2020-06-libbitcoinruntime\r\n\t\t1. In `src/init.cpp`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/test`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/wallet/test`\r\n\t\t1. In `src/qt/test`\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n- The above ordering is constructed according to the overall call graph of our codebase such that we avoid touching the same function/module twice. \r\n- Due to the length of this overall change, each commit aims to be trivially-reviewable and only requires the reviewer to reason about the correctness of one function/module at a time.\r\n- There are a lot of review-only assertions which can be used to check for correctness. They are removed in 2236237070a45fe570cd0113f0025b0a46ac89be.\r\n",

      "body": "> I think adding asserts should be making it clearer for people to see why the code is safe as well as automated tools.\r\n\r\nI agree about that statement :)\r\n\r\nIn _addition_ to that use I _also_ think assertions can be useful to get deterministic termination in case where we otherwise would get a null pointer dereference (if our assumption of non-null turns out to be false).\r\n\r\nWhy is that desired?\r\n\r\nOne might think that a null pointer dereference is guaranteed to lead to immediate termination. Unfortunately that is not the case: deterministic termination is the best outcome. Another possible outcome is what in the literature is called \"optimization-unsafety\" which can be problematic from a security perspective.\r\n\r\nThere is a neat paper covering optimization-safe code called [\"Towards Optimization-Safe Systems: Analyzing the Impact of Undefined Behavior\"](https://srg.doc.ic.ac.uk/440h/papers/stack.pdf) which I recommend for context.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think adding assertions can be handy as a cheap way to avoid some instances of potentially \"optimization-unsafe code\". That is my personal opinion: I know others might not agree and that is fine of course :)\r\n\r\n> (If you are getting this from an automated tool, are there reports from it around? I remember there were previously somewhere)\r\n\r\nIIRC Coverity and [Clang's Cross Translation Unit (CTU)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17454) static analysis flag these cases. I think most static analysers doing pointer analysis would flag at least some of these since it is non-trivial for them to infer non-`nullptr` in these cases AFAICT. I wouldn't be surprised if PVS Studio and cppcheck flags these too as an example.\r\n\r\nI don't have any reports readily available, but feel free to check the instructions in #18920 for instructions on how to get Bitcoin Core reports from Clang Static Analysis, clang-tidy and cppcheck. It only takes a couple of minutes of setup :)\r\n\r\nHope that helps! :)",
