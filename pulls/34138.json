    "body": "Builds on top of #34023, part of #30289.\r\n\r\nThis introduces a more accurate cost model for SFL, to control how much CPU time is spent inside the algorithm for clusters that cannot be linearized perfectly within a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nThe goal is having a metric for the amount of work performed, so that txmempool can impose limits on that work: a lower bound that is always performed (unless optimality is reached before that point, of course), and an upper bound to limit the latency and total CPU time spent on this. There are conflicting design goals here:\r\n* On the one hand, it seems ideal if this metric is closely correlated to actual CPU time, because otherwise the limits become inaccurate.\r\n* On the other hand, it seems a nightmare to have the metric be platform/system dependent, as it makes network-wide reasoning nearly impossible. It's expected that slower systems take longer to do the same thing; this holds for everything, and we don't need to compensate for this.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple solutions to this:\r\n* One extreme is just measuring the time. This is very accurate, but extremely platform dependent, and also non-deterministic due to random scheduling/cache effects.\r\n* The other extreme is using a very abstract metric like counting how many times certain loops/function inside the algorithm run. That is what is implemented as of #32545 and #34023, just counting the sum of the numbers of transactions updated across all `UpdateChunks()` calls. It however necessarily fails to account for significant portions of runtime spent elsewhere, resulting in a rather wide range of \"ns per cost\" values.\r\n* This PR takes a middle ground, counting many function calls / branches / loops, with weights that were determined through benchmarking on an average on a number of systems.\r\n",

      "body": "My thoughts: \r\n\r\nIt should use a metric like this, not time, because it would be weird and undesirable for the behavior to change a lot just based on what system you're on or what you're doing with it.  People expect slower computers to have higher cpu utilization and the intended limits are low enough that I think they won't be problematic on even quite slow computers.\r\n\r\nAn operation based metric based on the performance of any specific computer will likely be much more reflective of the real resourced used on *another* kind of computer than some simple iteration count-- so even if something profiled on a single computer doesn't reflect yours it beats keeping the iteration based approach.\r\n\r\nOne possibility would be to benchmark on several modern architectures like zen4, macpro, and graviton... normalize their coefficients for equal time on some corpus, and then average them.   As in the weights for the different measures are just the average of the systems except for some per-system scaling factor of expected average performance difference. (Or in the context of the regression used to fit this, fit a model on the coefficients with Archs-1 additional free scaling factors and then discard the scaling factors)--  e.g.  minimize ((A\\*x+B\\*y+C\\*z+..)+Arch1\\*(A\\*x+B\\*y+C\\*z+..)+Arch2\\*(A\\*x+B\\*y+C\\*z+..)-(Arch0time+Arch1time+Arch2time+...))^2.  This wouldn't reflect the cost on any specific system perfectly but it might give a better estimate overall, across multiple systems.  And my argument of \"A wrong cost is still better than no cost model\" still applies.  The downside is that you'd need to measure multiple systems to calibrate it.\r\n\r\nAn alternative might be to just use the coefficients for whatever popular modern hardware you think is most resource constrained--  better to have the unexpectedly show runs impact the fast computers more.  And at least this approach only requires the extensive profiling on one system.\r\n\r\nAs far as what transactions calibration should be against, a corpus of historical clusters is probably okay.  It would probably make sense to exclude from the corpus easy clusters, e.g. ones with fewer than 10 transactions. You only care if the metric is accurate on times near the limit.  I don't think using artificial cases is that helpful, as the metric will only be accurate 'on average' anyways. \r\n \r\nI don't think the coefficients need to be that well maintained over time except due to future algorithmic optimizations simply because doing *anything* here is better than just iteration counting.  And since it's desirable to behave mostly consistently (so when someone asks why was some suboptimal cluster picked you can just look and see finding it is usually over the limit, etc), you wouldn't want to updated them often -- probably only when advances in typical computer speeds also justify meaningfully increasing the limit overall such that almost all transactions would get as much or more optimization permitted under the new limits.\r\n",

      "body": "> An alternative might be to just use the coefficients for whatever popular modern hardware you think is most resource constrained-- better to have the unexpectedly show runs impact the fast computers more. And at least this approach only requires the extensive profiling on one system.\r\n\r\nFair enough, but an argument can also be made in favor of using metrics tuned for a relatively high-end system, in that those are likely a better predictor for which machines on the network, in the short to medium term future, will be responsible for actual transaction and block propagation. The numbers are such that any node, even running very low-end hardware, will not have trouble *keeping up* with mempool/relay, but from a network perspective, it's a well-connected subset of relatively fast systems that is responsible for relay.\r\n\r\n>  I don't think using artificial cases is that helpful, as the metric will only be accurate 'on average' anyways.\r\n\r\nHmm, that does risk situations where adverserially-constructed transactions are significantly (but still probably not more than a small factor, say 2x-3x) more expensive per cost. I think it makes sense to use as wide a variety of clusters, real and synthetic, to calibrate.",

I also tried regression that tried to relate overall linearization time with various linear factors (number of times each function/loop is executed), but it turned out to be far too noisy. The result ended up containing negative factors etc.\r\n\r\nSo I think that when #34023 is in, I will redo the numbers here with the same approach. For every function or non-trivial branch in the algorithm, benchmark it, and gather a histogram of its runtimes, broken down by loop iterations (e.g. in `Activate` broken down by #tx affected, in `PickMergeChunk` broken down by number of chunks visited, ...). Then look at the 90th or 99th percentile of those runtimes, and perform linear regression with just one variable, that iteration count.\r\n\r\nThe exact composition of the training data set shouldn't matter really, except to the extent that it has some variety, and not say all clusters with deps=tx-1 or so.",

In total, the number of\nchunks plus the number of active dependencies is always exactly equal to\nthe number of transactions, so it makes sense to have a shared pool of\nSetInfos, which are used for both chunks and top sets.\n\nTo that effect, introduce a separate m_set_info variable, which stores a\nSetInfo per transaction. Some of these are used for chunk sets, and some\nfor active dependencies' top sets. Every activation transforms the\nparent's chunk into the top set for the new dependency. Every\ndeactivation transforms the top set into the new parent chunk.\n\nWith that, there is little need for DepData anymore. Use parent/child\nTxIdxs to refer to dependencies, and find their top set by having a\nchild TxIdx-indexed vector in each TxData, rather than a list of\ndependencies. This makes code for iterating over dependencies more\nnatural and simpler.\n\nWith indexes into m_set_data (SetIdx) becoming bounded by the number of\ntransactions, we can use a SetType to represent sets of SetIdxs.\nSpecifically, an m_chunk_idxs is added which contains all SetIdx\nreferring to chunks. This leads to a much more natural way of iterating\nover chunks.\n\nAlso use this opportunity to normalize many variable names.",
