    "body": "Now that #32467 is merged, the only remaining usage of our old `CRITICAL_SECTION` macros (other than tests) is in `getblocktemplate()` and it can safely be replaced with a `REVERSE_LOCK`.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes that replacement, replaces the old `CRITICAL_SECTION` macro usage in tests, then deletes the macros themselves.\r\n\r\n~While testing this a few weeks ago, I noticed that `REVERSE_LOCK` does not currently work properly with our thread-safety annotations as after the `REVERSE_LOCK` is acquired, clang still believes that the mutex is locked. #32465 fixes this problem. Without that fix, this PR would potentially allow a false-negative if code were added in the future to this chunk of `getblocktemplate` which required `cs_main` to be locked.~\r\n\r\n~I added a test for the reverse lock here in the form of a compiler warning in `reverselock_tests.cpp` to simulate that possibility. This PR will therefore cause a new warning (and should fail a warnings-as-errors ci check) until #32465 is merged and this is rebased on top of it.~\r\n\r\nEdit: Rebased on top of #32465, so this should now pass tests.",
