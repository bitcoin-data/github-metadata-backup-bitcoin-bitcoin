    "body": "Adds the block timestamp to the debug.log output. Can be useful when catching up and viewing the progress in debug.log to see how far behind on the blockchain the node is. Can also be interesting to see the duration between blocks, and sometimes even seeing the odd block that has timestamps earlier than previous blocks - which could indicate whether the network is attempting to be manipulated.\n\nThis pull is a subset of pull #1311\n",
