      "body": "utACK 2a78098\r\n\r\nThe change in `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan` is consistent with `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` which initialises everything.\r\n\r\nAs for `WalletDescriptor`, there's not really a pattern for classes that use `ADD_SERIALIZE_METHODS` which variables we do and don't initialise. Afaik we only use the empty `WalletDescriptor()` constructor when loading a database record. In that case everything is initialised with `READWRITE`.\r\n\r\n I don't know if valgrind tools can reason through that; e.g, would it catch if we had forgotten `READWRITE(next_index)`? If so then maybe not initialising is smart (see recurring discussion elsewhere). But if it wouldn't catch that bug, then I don't see any downside to initialising them right away.",
