    "body": "This PR adds [secp256k1lab](https://github.com/secp256k1lab/secp256k1lab) as a subtree and uses it for low-level secp256k1 field and group arithmetic (i.e. replacing the contents of secp256k1.py) as a first step, primarily for demonstration purposes. Keeping it as a draft right now, to assess if there is conceptual support. The goal would be to keep the test framework code maintained here to Bitcoin Core specific parts and develop secp256k1-specific parts (e.g. MuSig, Silent Payments, FROST etc., to name a few upcoming ones) in secp256k1lab. I'm not sure if that's a clear win from a maintenance perspective (it could e.g. add friction, having to depend on and coordinate with secp256k1lab maintainers), but I'm curious to hear opinions. Suggested e.g. in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32642#pullrequestreview-2881144268.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are still some problems and open questions:\r\n* CI for \"Windows native\" job is failing (didn't check in detail yet, but I assume the secp256k1lab folder is not found due to failing Path.resolve() symlink resolution, i.e. the library is searched within the build folder)\r\n* BIP340 signing/verification can't be fully replaced yet (the test framework's Schnorr signing in `key.py`uses special testing parameters like `flip_p` and `flip_r` that aren't available in secp256k1lab)\r\n* Where to place the subtree? Originally I added it in `test_framework/crypto` but moved it up directly to `test`, for not having to add a linter mypy exception, as it only targets `test/functional/*`; maybe adding the subtree to a new folder like `test/libs` would be better for clarity",
