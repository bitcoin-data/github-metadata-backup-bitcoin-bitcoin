    "body": "When an addnode peer is disconnected by our IBD headers/blocks download timeout or stalling logic, `ThreadOpenAddedConnections` attempts to immediately reconnect it (unless \"onetry\" was passed to the addnode RPC) up to the limit of 8 addnode connections that is separate from regular peer connection limits.\r\n\r\nDuring IBD in a low-bandwidth environment, I see these disconnections+reconnections very frequently with high-quality addnode peers; see https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2025-01-22#1083973. The logging for these disconnections was: \"Peer is stalling block download, disconnecting <peer>.\" The ping times of the affected peers were often 20-100 seconds.\r\n\r\nAfter IBD, I continue to see the following addnode peer disconnections, albeit much less frequently: \"Timeout downloading block <hex>, disconnecting <peer>.\"\r\n\r\nThis is probably network, resource and time intensive to an extent, particularly in the case of I2P peers that involves destroying and rebuilding 2 tunnels per peer connection, and worth avoiding where it is simple to do so.\r\n\r\nAutomatic (non-manually added) peers are also disconnected, but they are a different category and case (non-trusted non-protected peers, no immediate reconnection) that would require monitoring over time to adjust the timeouts accordingly; mzumsande was looking into this (see https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2025-01-22#1083993).\r\n\r\nThe goal of this pull is therefore to avoid unnecessary disconnections/immediate reconnections of addnode peers.\r\n",

I'm not sure if we should give one addnode peer the power to let our entire IBD come to a halt completely.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to not give these peers unlimited time but clear their block requests (so that these blocks can be requested from other peers) so that they wouldn't be disconnected but also wouldn't be able to stall us indefinitely.\r\n",

That is, if a block is requested from a peer and not received within some time, then request it from other(s) as well, but don't cancel the original request. Then we take the block from whoever delivers it first. Subsequent receptions of the block from others would be an excess/redundant traffic, but I guess that is ok, if this technique is used carefully. Is this the same:\r\n\r\n> An alternative would be to not give these peers unlimited time but clear their block requests (so that these blocks can be requested from other peers)",
