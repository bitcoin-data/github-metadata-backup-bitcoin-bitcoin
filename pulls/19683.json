This means that we can be extremely specific w/re our search path ordering in order to avoid build problems that arise out of a user's specific environment/system setup and improve the robustness of our macOS toolchain. This PR does 2 things to this end:\r\n\r\n1. Unset environment variables which are known to alter search paths.\r\n1. Makes us (in the case of macOS builds) explicitly specify the list of system include search paths and its ordering, rather than rely on `clang`'s unreliable autodetection routine. Here is the [rabbit-hole gist](https://gist.github.com/dongcarl/5cdc6990b7599e8a5bf6d2a9c70e82f9).\r\n\r\n    See the added comments in `depends/hosts/darwin.mk` for more details:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8b8296dc70a0aa5ca86d11ba5d3151fc56208e25/depends/hosts/darwin.mk#L37-L60\r\n\r\nWe can be this specific _only_ because macOS builds are neatly contained in an SDK, **and** we are cross-compiling. Native toolchains should rely on the environment/distro/user to know how best to build for the running system.\r\n\r\nNote: Although the `-u` flag of `env` is not a POSIX standard flag, it seems like it is useful enough to be implemented in [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/env-invocation.html), [busybox](https://busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html#env), [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?env).",

          "body": "Patches OpenSSL source and the OSX build system on top of #2580, and replaces that PR.\r\n\r\n### OpenSSL source code patch - `cbc3aae`\r\n\r\nThis patches openssl 1.0.2's usage of `secure_getenv()` to always use the fallback `OPENSSL_issetugid()` instead, to remove reliance on a higher glibc than the minimum we currently support ([2.11](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/4c93783ab64ba96e60b7ea37202c072c66f3f544/contrib/devtools/symbol-check.py#L43))\r\n\r\nThe fallback code essentially does the same thing on linux as glibc's method, with the only difference that the glibc version makes decisions on startup, whereas the openssl version does the same check each time the environment is read.\r\n\r\nSee the [glibc check](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/enbl-secure.c;h=9e47526bd3e444e1a19a8ea9fd310b6f47c4db52;hb=HEAD) and [implementation](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=stdlib/secure-getenv.c;h=a394eebcf794c1279d66e5bcb71d4b15725e6e5a;hb=HEAD), and the [openssl check]( https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_0_2u/crypto/uid.c) for reference.\r\n\r\nThis patch can be removed when glibc 2.17 is the minimum version supported, i.e. for 1.21, [where the minimum glibc version is 2.17](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/blob/b262c2b3be9e1f40b362e65cea01bdd9204260dc/contrib/devtools/symbol-check.py#L42)\r\n\r\n### OSX build system fix - `043ce9a`\r\n\r\nBecause of `make depend` magic needed inside OpenSSL not using `config.site` (only autoconf uses it, not make), `clang` was not being found when not installed inside the `$PATH`, and making the CI, which has that installed inside the `$PATH`, compile with the wrong compiler (the provided one rather than the \"native\" dependency from `depends/`)\r\n\r\nI've added this selectively cherry-picked backport from Bitcoin Core (880660a) that fixates the location of `clang` and `clang++` properly, making sure that the correct pinned binary (from native depends) gets used, and not any other `clang`, i.e. something installed on the build system exposed through `$PATH`. I have removed all code surrounding the macOS native depends build from the original commit, because we do not have that facility in 1.14.\r\n\r\nNote that there's a detailed explanation added to the `depends/Makefile` that clarifies how binary locations specified in the different `host` and `package` descriptors are being used. More changes can and imho should be made to these descriptors, but as these do not block OpenSSL 1.0.2u compilation, we can do this separately and I have not included these with this PR.",

The next change after that is M1 support (#4405).",
