I'd interpret Workspace as an \"in-out\" parameter used throughout `MemPoolAccept::AcceptSingleTransaction`. As I understand it, this PR makes it `const` for 2 of the intermediate steps based on some code analysis, but I think it might just be coincidentally unmodified inside those functions 😅 I'd like to be able to update the workspace inside `PolicyScriptChecks`/`ConsensusScriptChecks`.",
