    "body": "These changes implement countermeasures 3 (feeler connections) suggested in our paper: \"Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network\".\n# Design:\n\nWe observe that a node's resistance to eclipse attacks grows as the number of online addresses in the tried table grows. To increase the number of online addresses in the tried table the following logic is implemented in net.cpp's ThreadOpenConnections:\n1. Every 2 minutes a short lived _feeler connection_ is made to a randomly selected address in new.\n2. If the tested address is online and running bitcoind, this address is moved to the tried table.\n3. The feeler connection to the tested address is closed.\n\nOnly one feeler connection is attempted at any one time and feeler connections are only attempted after all outgoing connections slots of filled.\n# Advantages:\n- In our paper we sample several peer lists. We found that a large percentage of addresses in tried tables are stale IP addresses (the lowest was 72 percent stale, the highest was 95 percent stale). This large number of stale IP addresses increases the risk of eclipse attacks. This change remedies this by ensuring that the tried table grows quickly and contains many recently online addresses.\n- Not only do feeler connections provide a direct benefit to the node doing the testing but the tested node, if online, learns about our node and adds it to its tried table (conferring herd immunity even under partial deployment).\n- Countermeasure 3 (test-before-evict) builds on the feeler connections introduced in this change. This is the first step to deploying countermeasure 3.\n# Risk mitigation:\n- To limit the network impact of the feeler connections we only make one new connection every 2 minutes. Compared with other networking tasks that bitcoind performs the bandwidth increase is very slight.\n- To avoid issues of synchronization we introduce a random sleep of between 0 and 1000 milliseconds prior to making a feeler connection.\n- To avoid threading issues the feeler connections are made in the same thread as non-feeler connections.\n# Test plan:\n1. I'm currently running two EC2 nodes with public IP addresses. One is running this pull request and the other is running standard bitcoind. Both are running with arg -debug=1. At the end of the week I will post results from the logs looking at differences in the size of the tried table and examining the logs for any errors. I will also use the peer.dat files generated from this test to evaluate each nodes resistance to eclipse attacks.\n2. I will also use packet captures to ensure behavior and bandwidth behaves as expected.\n3. I invite anyone would like to help to run standard and feeler connection nodes and email me (Ethan.R.Heilman@gmail.com) the pcaps, logs and peers.dat files. I will post the results of this analysis here.\n\nThis change was suggested as Countermeasure 4 in\n[Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/263.pdf),\nEthan Heilman, Alison Kendler, Aviv Zohar, Sharon Goldberg.\nePrint Archive Report 2015/263.

      "body": "**Summary:** To test feeler connections I ran two nodes on EC2 for ~one month. One node ran this pull request, the second node ran default Bitcoin.  According to this test feeler connections (this pull request) increase the size of the tried table by about an order of magnitude and consequently increase the eclipse resistance of a node by an order of magnitude. I also measured the impact of a future pull request _test-before-evict_ where IPs are not evicted from the tried table if they are online.\n\n# Tried Table\n\n![Comparing the size of the tried table over time](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/274814/17309873/0ce8192a-580f-11e6-9119-a2150ef8c3df.png)\n\nOne node ran this pull request for 32 days (July 1st to August 1st), the second node ran default Bitcoin for 35 Days (June 28 to August 1st).\n\nOn August 1st I disconnected the nodes and graphed the results. I tested which nodes in the tried table were online on August 1st.\n- The Feeler connections node had **1309 IPs** in the tried table of which 38.8% or 590 IPs were online.\n- The default Bitcoin node had **195 IPs** in the tried table of which 28.2% or 55 IPs were online.\n\n# Security Benefit\n\nTo determine the security benefit of these larger numbers of IPs in the tried table I modeled the attack presented in [Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/263). Full  details on how this was carried out are given at bottom of this comment. \n\n![attackergraph40000-10-1000short-line](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/274814/17366828/372af458-595b-11e6-81e5-2c9f97282305.png)\n\n**Default node:** 595 attacker IPs for ~50% attack success.\n**Default node + test-before-evict:** 620 attacker IPs for ~50% attack success.\n**Feeler node:** 5540 attacker IPs for ~50% attack success.\n**Feeler node + test-before-evict:** 8600 attacker IPs for ~50% attack success.\n\nThe node running feeler connections has 10 times as many online IP addresses in its tried table making an attack 10 times harder (i.e. requiring the an attacker require 10 times as many IP addresses in different /16s). Adding test-before-evict increases resistance of the node by an additional 3000 attacker IP addresses. \n\nBelow I graph the attack over even greater attacker resources (i.e. more attacker controled IP addresses). Note that test-before-evict maintains some security far longer even against an attacker with 50,000 IPs. If this node had a larger tried table test-before-evict could greatly boost a nodes resistance to eclipse attacks.\n\n![attacker graph long view](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/274814/17367108/96f46d64-595c-11e6-91cd-edba160598e7.png)\n\n# Modeling an Eclipse Attack\n\nUsing the peers.dat file from the default node and the feeler connections node I reconstructed their tried tables (I ignore the new table in our attacks as it is trivial to fill it with trash IP addresses). The attack test was run as follows:\n1. Attempt to insert X attacker IP addresses each from distinct \\16s into a model of a node's tried table.\n2. Select nodes from each nodes tried table based on the logic in net.cpp (each outgoing connection must be from a different \\16, only connect to online nodes).\n3. If the attacker's IPs are selected for all 8 outgoing connections the attacker wins as the attacker has partitioned the node from the rest of the network otherwise the attacker loses. For realism I only allowed the node to connect to other nodes which were online.\n\nFor each value X of number of attacker IPs I ran the attack 1000 times. For each of these 1000 runs I calculated the attack success probability by performing the selection of 8 outgoing connections 10 times. I used the peers.dat file from the feelers connection node and the default node to build the model of the tried table for the attack. I simulated the impact of enabling test-before-evict would have if turned on just prior to the attack (this should not be different than if the node has been running test-before-evict all along) by preventing the attacker from evicting an IP in the tried table if that node was online.\n",

By moving reachable addresses from the new table to the tried table it protects those reachable addresses from being evicted by unreachable addresses.\n2. By testing addresses in the new table via feeler connections and marking those addresses in the new table which are offline as failed it should help to slowly remove unreachable nodes from the new table increasing the percentage of reachable nodes in the new table.\n3. By making feeler connections a node helps advertise itself increasing the number of reachable nodes in other nodes tried table.\n\nThese changes will increase the health of the tried and new table and should by extension increase the reachable nodes in address advertisements.\n\nI have rebased.\n",
