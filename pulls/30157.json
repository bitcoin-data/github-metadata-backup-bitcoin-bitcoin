    "body": "### This PR aims at improving Bitcoin Core fee estimation\r\n\r\n\r\n### The objectives of this improvement are to:\r\n\r\n- Reduce overestimation done by the current `CBlockPolicyEstimator`\r\n- Make the fee estimator aware of the state of the mempool, allowing it to respond to changing conditions immediately.\r\n- Empower node users to be self-sovereign and use their node's estimates, as is now, the majority rely on third parties for fee estimation.\r\n- Simplify the process of adding new fee estimation strategies in the future.\r\n\r\nThe PR creates a new `FeeEstimator` class responsible for getting estimates from one or more subscribed `Forecaster`'s.\r\n\r\nA `Forecaster` will register with the `FeeEstimator` as being able to provide estimates, and when an estimate is requested, should return two fee rate estimates (high and low) and a confidence level.\r\n\r\nThe estimator will then take (currently 1):\r\n1. The lowest estimated rate between the Forecasters estimate and the `CBlockPolicyEstimator` estimate.\r\n\r\n...and return the two 'high' and 'low' estimations to the user.\r\n\r\nThe FeeEstimator` also owns access to `CBlockPolicyEstimator`, accessible via a pointer.\r\n\r\nThis PR deliberately does **not** try to modify the existing fee estimation code, but instead uses new modules with cleaner separation. This will make new code and interfaces much easier to introduce, and also make it easier to, if desired in the future, drop `CBlockPolicyEstimator` code.\r\n\r\n### Currently, this PR implements one forecaster:\r\n\r\n1. Mempool-based forecaster (`MemPoolForecaster`): It estimates fees simply by generating a block template from the node's mempool and returns the 25th and 50th percentile mining scores as low-priority and high-priority fee estimates, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese forecaster estimate fees for (1, 2) block confirmation targets, referred to as \"as soon as possible (ASAP)\" fee rate estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this forecaster; use of RBF is strongly recommended so that transactions can be fee-bumped if desired.\r\n\r\n### Next steps:\r\n\r\n- Extend the feature to the wallet; currently it's only exposed in an RPC `estimatefee`.\r\n\r\n- Update forecasters to return confidence levels in their estimates.\r\n\r\n### Confidence levels of Mempool Forecaster\r\n\r\nConfidence levels are determined by heuristics.\r\n\r\nFor the mempool-based forecaster:\r\n\r\n- Suspected high mining score transactions should be confirmed but aren't.\r\n- Most transactions in previously mined blocks were in our node's mempool.\r\n- High mining score mempool transactions are confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe fee estimator will select the fee rate from the forecaster based on confidence level instead of just taking the lower `CBlockPolicyEstimator` fee rate estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How does this fit in with `CBlockPolicyEstimator`?\r\n\r\nThis fee estimator owns the block policy `CBlockPolicyEstimator` and does not change any of its interfaces. The wallet still uses `estimatesmartfee`, and RPCs also access it through the Fee Estimator.\r\nHowever, this will change when we switch to using estimates from `GetFeeEstimateFromForecasters`, which works much better than the `estimatesmartfee` in (1, 2) confirmation target scenarios.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when we have another forecaster that supports confirmation targets beyond (1, 2) and works better than `estimatesmartfee`, we will eventually phase out `CBlockPolicyEstimator` as the new Fee Estimator module makes it easy to do so.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses two open issues and has been requested by users in the past.\r\n\r\n#27995\r\n#30009\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n1. **Will miners broadcast high fee rate transactions, and then evict them with a conflicting transaction in the next block, trick users of this fee estimator into making transactions with high fees?**\r\n   https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/6?u=ismaelsadeeq\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this concern by ensuring that the fee estimate does not surge immediately whenever this happens the mempool based forecaster estimate will be higher `CBlockPolicyEstimator`. As such the estimate from `CBlockPolicyEstimator` will be returned, preventing users to be victims of this attack.\r\n\r\n2. **In times of high confirmation times or high block space demand, fee estimates tend to rise. If the mempool-based forecaster estimate rises, the fee estimator will fall back to the last six blocks fee estimate, if it's low, will that make transactions constructed with the estimate get stuck in the mempool?**\r\nThe ASAP fee estimate provides an estimate for transactions to confirm in the next one or two blocks. During periods of high confirmation times, fee rates rise due to congestion. Once a block is mined, the mempool clears high mining score transactions, making room for lower fee rate transactions. If congestion recurs and the transaction is time-sensitive, users can safely fee bump assuming it's an RBF-enabled transaction.\r\nIn times of immediate high block demand, if the mempool-based fee estimate surges while `CBlockPolicyEstimator` estimates are low, users can fee bump their transactions if they take longer to confirm. As more blocks are mined, and demand decreases, the mempool forecaster will immediately respond to the new conditions by providing a lower fee estimate and the fee estimator will return it instead.\r\n\r\n3. **Currently, getting a block template is expensive. How do you tackle that in the mempool-based forecaster?**\r\nThe forecaster cache the recently generated fee rate estimates and only generate a new block template when the time delta between the recent estimate and the current time exceeds 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is a collaborative work with @willcl-ark and a result of collecting insight from other contributors.\r\n",

      "body": "> The state of the node's mempool may not accurately reflect the state of others' mempools, and not even its own mempool when the block is found in the future. It isn't a good single source of information.\r\n\r\nCorrect. The rationale behind this set of changes can be summed up briefly as follows:\r\n\r\n- Add a new standalone modular fee estimation manager to which (many) `Forcasters` can be trivially added or removed (vs modifying `BlockPolicyEstimator`).\r\n- Provide two forcaster implementations which do not exist today ( 1. mempool-based and 2. previous-6-blocks-seen-in-mempool) to demonstrate functionality.\r\n\r\nIn the present, there is a strong tendency for users of Bitcoin Core to consult external fee estimation services when they want timely (next 1 or 2 blocks) confirmation of transactions, whilst also not overpaying. Examples of these include mempool.space, whatthefee.io, Samourai's [nextblock.is](https://blog.samourai.is/introducing-nextblock-fee-estimator/) (now down), [johoe](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,1w,weight), [blockchair](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin) etc., with more popping up every month.\r\n\r\nWe also analysed/estimated Bitcoin Core users not using in-built estimation in a post [here](https://hackmd.io/@kEyqkad6QderjWKtcBF5Hg/cChallengies-with-estimating-transaction-fees).\r\n\r\nIn our opinion having users feel the need to use external fee estimation services that they could equally have served to them by their own node, feels sub-optimal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, when users do use the current Bitcoin Core fee estimator, there are often times when they end up overpaying, see delving bitcoin post [Mempool based fee estimation](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703) and various issues over the years e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30009 . This is avoidable.\r\n\r\nWork from a student of @renepickhardt [link](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/12) demonstrated something we also measured independently -- that bitcoin core's current estimates are often overpaying significantly following fee spikes. This effect can be directly mitigated by using a mempool-based estimation.\r\n\r\n>  Perhaps it is a good idea to use it as a secondary source, but probably it should only ever adjust fee estimations upward, not down.\r\n\r\nIn this changeset we take the approach of using the lowest result from all \"confident\" `Forcasters`. The rationale is that we expect users wanting fast confirmation to have RBF enabled, allowing them to bump fees if we still undershoot.\r\n\r\nComments from @harding [link](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/6) explained that it may be possible for miners to _artificially_ increase a strictly-mempool-based fee-rate. By taking the lower (confident) result from `n` `Forcasters`, we attempt to protect against this attack (and others like it), at the potential cost of having to RBF.\r\n\r\nWe do plan to add additional sanity checks to the mempool-based Forcaster as described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27995, but these are not yet implemented. In any case, even without these additional checks we have been seeing much-improved short time-scale estimations from Bitcoin Core.",
