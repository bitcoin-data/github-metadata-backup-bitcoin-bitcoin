    "body": "This picks up #19995 in an attempt to solve #21559.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to mitigate disk filling attacks by temporarily rate limiting `LogPrintf(…)`.\r\n\r\nA disk fill attack is an attack where an untrusted party (such as a peer) is able to cheaply make your node log to disk excessively. The excessive logging may fill your disk and thus make your node crash either cleanly (best case: if disk fill rate is relatively slow) or uncleanly (worst case: if disk fill rate is relatively fast).\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nThe hourly logging quota is set **per source location**. Every single source location (say net_processing.cpp:418) gets a quota of 1 MB of logging per hour. Logging is only dropped from source locations that exceed the quota.\r\n\r\n- Only logging to disk is rate limited. Logging to console is not rate limited.\r\n- Only `LogPrintf(…)` is rate limited. `LogPrint(category, …)` (`-debug`) is not rate limited.\r\n- `UpdateTip: new best=[…]` is logged using `LogPrintfWithoutRateLimiting(…)` to avoid rate limiting. High log volume is expected for that source location during IBD.\r\n- When logging is restarted a tally of how many messages/bytes were dropped is printed.\r\n- Log rate limiting can be disabled with the `-ratelimitlogging` config option.\r\n- All logs will be prefixed with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently being suppressed.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nIn a recent [PR Review Club meeting](https://bitcoincore.reviews/21603) we discussed this PR and evaluated alternative approaches.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Global rate limiting </summary>\r\n\r\n#### Global rate limiting\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion around an alternative approach which would be to globally rate limit `LogPrintf(…)`.  This approach was implemented in a competing PR #21706. The main point [1] in favor of global rate limiting is that it could be confusing to have incomplete logs when logs from one source location are dropped but not from others. The main point against global rate limiting is that it opens another attack vector where an attacker could trigger rate limiting and then execute a 2. attack which would then not be document in the logs at all. With regard to the attack vector on the global approach and the overall reviews the two approaches have gotten I have chosen to continue with the approach in this PR. \r\n(To address the concern of [1] i have chosen to prefix all logs with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently being suppressed.)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>logrotate</summary>\r\n\r\n#### logrotate\r\n\r\nLarryRuane brought up [logrotate](https://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate) which can be used on linux to monitor log files and perform actions (delete, compress, send somewhere, etc.) on them when a certain size or point in time is reached. `logrotate` could be used to rate limit log but since we would like log rate limiting to be enabled by default it is not the best solution. Also on windows an alternative would have to be used.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI have a written a unit test which is contained in this PR. (Not the greatest test, it currently does not work on windows thanks to `\\r\\n`. If someone has an idea how to improve the test i would appreciate it)\r\n\r\nFurther more I made a RPC [here](https://github.com/dergoegge/bitcoin/commit/8e6d15d6be06834d1f634f4a54ea646be8bc3491) that can log excessive amounts of \"a\"s from different locations which i have found useful during my own testing.\r\n`bitcoin-cli excessivelog <location (1-5)> <num_bytes>`\r\n\r\n⚠️One thing to note with that rpc is that the rate limiting logic still prints the last message that triggered the limiting to disk, so something like `bitcoin-cli excessivelog 1 536870912` would still log ~512MiB to disk. Logging to console is also never suppressed (unless -printtoconsole=0)  ⚠️\r\n\r\nA simple example to use the rpc:\r\n```bash\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest setmocktime 1\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 1048500 # log just under 1MiB\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 100 # this should get the total amount logged above 1MiB\r\n                                        # and the rate limiting logic should kick in\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest setmocktime 3602 # let 1 hour pass (only works in regtest)\r\nbitcoin-cli -regtest excessivelog 1 100 # this should trigger logging to resume\r\n```\r\n",

We can also always tell if rate limiting is taking place since we log when it starts/stops and in those cases a partial log is better then no log.\r\n\r\n(This is obviously mostly an opinion and I am totally willing to be convinced of global log-schedding if enough reviewers favor it)",

I'm not certain I got it right though - @jnewbery, feel free to chime in :)\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to do it as separate PR since it deviates in important ways from the original suggestion. By having two separate PRs we would see which of the two approaches to address this type of attack that have consensus support.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think I could live with both approaches: as long as we kill the disk-fill-via-logging bug class sooner rather than later I'm happy :)",

Logging to console is also never suppressed (unless -printtoconsole=0)  ⚠️\r\n\r\nA simple example to use the rpc:\r\n```bash\r\nbitcoin-cli excessivelog 1 1048500 # log just under 1MiB\r\nbitcoin-cli excessivelog 1 100 # this should get the total amount logged above 1MiB and the rate limiting logic should kick in\r\n```",

The old rule, which is no longer valid but probably still in many contributors' heads was that one only needs to be careful about `LogPrintf`, while category-base logging is not so critical.",

      "body": "> having a rate limit only for LogPrintf but not for unconditionally logged category-based warnings and errors would be confusing.\r\n\r\nAlso agree with this and i want to add that to this PR.\r\n\r\nThe two new categories I introduce here (`UNCONDITIONAL_ALWAYS` and `UNCONDITIONAL_RATE_LIMITED`) don't really make sense anymore, given that we now also have category based unconditional logging. Whether a log location should be rate limited could purely be based on the severity level.\r\nI was thinking of the following: Adding an extra severity `Always` which is logged unconditionally without rate limiting (e.g. for [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1b2e1d179c5b350cac69ee670e01355314f25e11/src/validation.cpp#L2517) location) and rate limiting logging to disk if `severity == None || (severity >= Warning && severity < Always)`. Additionally, categories specified by `-debug=cat` should still be logged unconditionally without rate limiting.  @mzumsande @jonatack @MarcoFalke what do y'all think of that?",

      "body": "> I was thinking of the following: Adding an extra severity `Always` which is logged unconditionally without rate limiting (e.g. for [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1b2e1d179c5b350cac69ee670e01355314f25e11/src/validation.cpp#L2517) location) and rate limiting logging to disk if `severity == None || (severity >= Warning && severity < Always)`. Additionally, categories specified by `-debug=cat` should still be logged unconditionally without rate limiting. @mzumsande @jonatack @MarcoFalke what do y'all think of that?\r\n\r\nSo, it seems to me that with the recent changes, we currently have \r\n1) Unconditional logging with no level and no category (`LogPrintf`)\r\n2) Conditional logging with category but no level (`LogPrint`) - not relevant to this PR\r\n3) Unconditional logging with category but no level (`LogPrintfCategory`)\r\n4) Logging with category and level, which may be unconditional depending on the level (`LogPrintLevel`)\r\n\r\nThe \"missing\" combination of logging by level but without a category is currently not possible as far as I can see.\r\n\r\nIf there would be a use case for having \"Always\" logged messages also to have a severity like \"Warning\" or \"Error\" we'd need another dimension -  but I think that at least for the current uses this is not the case, so your suggestion makes sense to me.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm really not sure how stable the current state of the changes to the logging framework is, it seems very much in flow and I'm a little bit confused about what direction it is heading:\r\n- The severity threshold mentioned in 4) was added in #25202, but after reading [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25306#issuecomment-1150250132) by @laanwj I'm not sure it will stay.\r\n- Is the final goal for each logging message to have both a category and a level so that 1) and 2)  and 3) would vanish over time? That would probably reduce the complexity of the rate-limiting considerably.\r\n\r\n",
