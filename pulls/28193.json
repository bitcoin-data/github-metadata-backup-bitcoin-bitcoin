    "body": "This PR adds unit test coverage for the script compression functions `{Compress,Decompress}Script` in the special case of uncompressed P2PK outputs (scriptPubKey: OP_PUSH65 <0x04 ....> OP_CHECKSIG) with [pubkeys that are not fully valid](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/pubkey.cpp#L297-L302), i.e. where the encoded point is not on the secp256k1 curve. For those outputs, script compression is not possible, as the y coordinate of the pubkey can't be recovered (see also call-site of `IsToPubKey`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/compressor.cpp#L49-L50\r\n\r\nLikewise, for a compressed script of an uncompressed P2PK script (i.e. compression ids 4 and 5) where the x coordinate is not on the curve, decompression fails:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/compressor.cpp#L122-L129\r\n\r\nNote that the term \"compression\" is used here in two different meanings (though they are related), which might be a little confusing. The encoding of a pubkey can either be compressed (33-bytes with 0x02/0x03 prefixes) or uncompressed (65-bytes with 0x04 prefix). On the other hand there is also compression for whole output scripts, which is used for storing scriptPubKeys in the UTXO set in a compact way (and also for the `dumptxoutset` result, accordingly). P2PK output scripts with uncompressed pubkeys get compressed by storing only the x-coordinate and the sign as a prefix (0x04 = even, 0x05 = odd). Was diving deeper into the subject while working on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27432, where the script decompression of uncompressed P2PK needed special handling (see also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24628#issuecomment-1108798536).\r\n\r\nTrivia: as of now (block 801066), there are 13 uncompressed P2PK outputs in the UTXO set with a pubkey not on the curve (which obviously means they are unspendable).",

This results in some things that would have given an address for P2PK scripts to no longer do so. This is arguably more correct.\r\n\r\n`ExtractDestination`'s behavior is slightly changed for the above. It now returns `true` for those destinations that have addresses, so P2PK scripts now result in `false`. Even though it returns false for `CNoDestination`, the script will now be included in that `CNoDestination`.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #28244",

          "body": "Some future work needs to touch things in script/standard.{h/cpp}, however it is unclear if it is safe to do so as they are included in several different places that could effect standardness and consensus. It contains a mix of policy parameters, consensus parameters, and utilities only used by the wallet. This PR breaks up the various components and renames the files to clearly separate everything.\r\n\r\n* `CTxDestination` is moved to a new file `src/addresstype.{cpp/h}`\r\n* `TaprootSpendData` and `TaprootBuilder` (and their utility functions and structs) are moved to `SigningProvider` as these are used only during signing.\r\n* `CScriptID` is moved to `script/script.h` to be next to `CScript`.\r\n* `MANDATORY_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS` is moved to `interpreter.h`\r\n* The parameters `DEFAULT_ACCEPT_DATACARRIER` and `MAX_OP_RETURN_RELAY` are moved to `policy.h`\r\n* `standard.{cpp/h}` is renamed to `solver.{cpp/h}` since that's all that's left in the file after the above moves",

The project is tracked in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28536\r\n\r\n## BIP352\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",

Built the PR branch, ran the unit and functional tests, everything passed.\r\n\r\nTo further validate the changes, I executed some small mutation tests checking the robustness of the test. Here's the summary:\r\n\r\n**Altering the Initial Byte of** `pubkey_raw`: Changed the initial byte from 4 to 2 (and tried 3), testing the assumption that the script specifically handles uncompressed pubkeys not on the curve. As expected, the test failed, validating the test's accuracy in identifying uncompressed pubkeys.\r\n\r\n**Making the Pubkey Fully Valid**: Modified the generation of `x_not_on_curve` to produce fully valid pubkeys. The test failed, showing its ability to differentiate between compressible and non-compressible pubkeys based on curve validity.\r\n\r\n**Forcing `CompressScript` and `DecompressScript` to Succeed**: Introduced changes to make these functions return true regardless of the actual input. The test identified these forced successes as incorrect outcomes, indicating their reliability in catching improper script (de)compression behaviors.\r\n\r\n**Altering the Script Size Check**: Changed the expected script size to an incorrect value (68U instead of 67U). The test failed, highlighting its precision in validating script size expectations.\r\n\r\nThe new unit test robustly identifies and responds correctly to various edge cases. It's effective in handling script compression/decompression for uncompressed P2PK outputs with invalid pubkeys. Everything looks good to me.",

What is the rationale for using randomness, rather than choosing a fixed X value that is not on the curve (e.g. `fd0473a380ddf239accbc31770fcc6e64096930eaa8bc57c10f5868f3596fe1e`)?  Seems like the other tests in the test file use randomness as well (e.g. `GenerateRandomKey()`), so maybe I'm missing something.  Selecting a known invalid X value would technically increase test repeatability and consistency of test execution performance (although all of the 10 runs executed locally resulted in no more than a handful of X-picking attempts before finding an invalid X value, so performance is hardly a concern here).\r\n\r\nIf I'm not overlooking something, slightly less than half of the 32-byte space is valid X coordinates on the curve, so random selection would seem to have a negligible risk of starvation in finding an off-curve X value.\r\nhttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/55196/is-there-a-point-on-the-secp256k1-curve-for-any-given-x-coordinate",

Only once over ~50 runs did it try 6 times.\r\n\r\n(`MakeNewKeyWithFastRandomContext()` in `orphanage_tests` also uses `.randbytes(32)` but that's for calculating private keys which don't have invalid values (except possibly 0?). `GenerateRandomKey()` is also for private keys.)",
