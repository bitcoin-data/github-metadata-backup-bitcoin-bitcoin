    "body": "The \"data\" field without outputs was marked as \"required\" in the help docs when using bitcoin-cli. This field when left off worked as an intended optional OP_RETURN. closes #27828.\r\n\r\nMotivation: It is hard to understand that \"data\" is actually optional for commands like `createpsbt` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt`.\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

How would someone properly indicate the \"data\" is optional if not specifying it as optional? The parent output is required and some of it's children elements are optional.

You can also specify both, but you must have at least one.\r\n\r\nI'm reading over this block of help text again. \r\n```\r\n(json array, required) The outputs (key-value pairs), where none of the keys are duplicated.\r\n                                      That is, each address can only appear once and there can only be one 'data' object.\r\n                                      For compatibility reasons, a dictionary, which holds the key-value pairs directly, is also\r\n                                      accepted as second parameter.\r\n```\r\n\r\njust using separate objs\r\n```json \r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"bc1address1\":\"0.01\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"bc1address2\":\"0.02\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"data\":\"ff00ff00ff\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nor...\r\nAlso note:\r\n`a dictionary, which holds the key-value pairs directly, is also accepted as second parameter.`\r\nI believe this is saying you can also do something like:\r\n```json \r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"bc1address1\":\"0.01\",\r\n        \"bc1address2\":\"0.02\",\r\n        \"data\":\"ff00ff00ff\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nI think this style is for compatibility reasons per docs, so I'm guessing it's preferred/future proof to break everything out into individual objects.
