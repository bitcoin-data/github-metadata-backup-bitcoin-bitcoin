Another source of test randomness is the GetAdjustedTime function.\r\n\r\nI presume `GetAdjustedTime` is non-deterministic because it asks the system for the time. With `SetMockTime` you can make it return the time you (or the fuzz engine) set.\r\n\r\n`insecure_rand` could be made deterministic by accepting a bool parameter to the addrman constructor and passing it on to `insecure_rand`.",

I'm now also mocking the time, but I skipped the suggested `insecure_rand` change since I don't want to change any code outside of `src/test/fuzz/` in this PR. That can be taken in a follow-up if deemed necessary.\r\n\r\nI think this PR should be ready for final review now. Many thanks for your patience: may I ask you to review for the n:th time? :)",
