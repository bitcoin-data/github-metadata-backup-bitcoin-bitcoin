    "body": "During a reorg, we currently try to add transactions from each disconnected block back to the mempool, even though we are likely to find many of those transactions in the blocks that get connected.\r\n\r\nThis PR stores those transactions in a separate \"disconnect pool\" for later processing. This has a few side effects:\r\n\r\n * There should be many fewer transactions to re-add to the mempool, assuming the reorg is benign and most transactions appear on both forks, which means we'll do less work.\r\n\r\n * When we do add things to the mempool, we'll do it in one attempt rather than separately for each disconnected block, so mempool chain limits will be calculated and applied differently for reorgs than before. Overall it should be much more efficient, because we will have fewer calls chasing long chains in the mempool to keep track of ancestor and descendant state (both because we will call UpdateTransactionsFromBlock on a smaller set of transactions overall, and because the descendant caching it does isn't reused across calls, so it's more efficient to call UpdateTransactionsFromBlock once for all of a reorg's transactions than multiple times).\r\n\r\n * Storing the transactions in this new disconnect pool means we use more memory during a reorg. I've added a bound on how much memory can be used, and if we would exceed it we just try to keep the oldest transactions that are disconnected (the idea being that it's more important to ensure that older transactions that are reorged out have an opportunity to be re-mined, compared with newer ones). This could probably be improved in the future, since in such a (rare) scenario, we would probably want to throw out our current mempool in favor of being able to hold more older transactions, or we might want to re-read those transactions off disk to try to pick up everything that is now unconfirmed. But for now I made the memory bound large enough that this shouldn't practically occur.\r\n",

The validation.cpp conflict can be fixed by updating AcceptToMemoryPool arguments which changed in edded808fc4eee94c178e1779b90d1c87a08c23a (#9499).\r\n",

      "body": "Rebased.\r\n\r\n@ryanofsky The changes to pruning.py are because:\r\n * Policy limits get applied differently than before; we used to ignore some of the chain limits when adding transactions back to the mempool during a reorg (because we wouldn't look for in-mempool descendants until the end).\r\n * The pruning test is trying to build really big blocks in a number of places, to make the chain big enough to be pruned, and in particular in a few places it relies on the mempool being populated with disconnected transactions after a reorg (so changes to policy that would prevent that are problematic for the test).\r\n\r\nSo I mitigated this in part by increasing the chain limits and in part by trying to keep the mempool somewhat populated with a node's wallet transactions at a couple relevant places in the test.\r\n\r\n[I actually briefly thought that because we now save the mempool in between restarts, we may not need the `resendwallettransactions()` calls I added (which I use to populate the mempool somewhat in a couple places), but I tested locally that removing them results in test failure (plausibly because the mined blocks aren't big enough, which I think is due to the reorg behavior change).  I do think this test needs to be overhauled now that many of the assumptions around mempool behavior have changed, but I think we should do that in another PR.]",

Luckily, #9014 makes this a bit eaiser to fix - dont keep more than a few blocks around in shared_ptrs, just re-read them from disk after the reorg is complete when you need to call signalers. This may be complicated due to pruning, but it should be doable.\n",

This means that height-dependent consensus rules are checked assuming the height is one greater than it actually is, which is a problem when disconnecting the last block before a network upgrade (e.g. during a reorg across the upgrade boundary).\r\n\r\nUpstream appear to have coincidentally resolved this while making performance improvements in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9208.

This means that height-dependent consensus rules are checked assuming the height is one greater than it actually is, which is a problem when disconnecting the last block before a network upgrade (e.g. during a reorg across the upgrade boundary).\r\n\r\nThis has additional consequences with special transactions (that's why it was discovered in #2267), as, during a reorg, `ProUp*` transactions, included in the block, might not be resurrected in the mempool, due to the inconsistent state of chainActive.",

I could call ReacceptToMemoryPool(), but doing so after we've invoked AbortNode() seems either annoying (trying to lookup UTXOs from disk when we're potentially having disk trouble seems bad), or potentially problematic (is it okay to trigger SyncTransaction() callbacks when our on-disk state is potentially corrupt?). \r\n\r\nOne idea: check to see if fShutdownRequested is set, and if so, just wipe the disconnectpool and the mempool so that any observers of the mempool won't see a potentially inconsistent state (and if fShutdownRequested is not set, call ReacceptToMemoryPool() -- this should never happen).  Then the mempool saving won't work in the event of an AbortNode(), but maybe that's okay, we're probably out of disk space anyway.\r\n\r\n@sipa Any suggestions on how to handle this?",
