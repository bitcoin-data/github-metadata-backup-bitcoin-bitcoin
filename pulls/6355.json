    "body": "These changes implement countermeasures 3 (feeler connections) and 4 (test-before-evict) suggested in our paper: [\"Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network\"](http://cs-people.bu.edu/heilman/eclipse/).\n# Design:\n\nThe primary change is the creation of a feeler connection thread.  Every 2 minutes this feeler thread launches one feeler connection, increasing the default number of max outgoing connections to 9. Feeler connections are very short lived and disconnect upon verifying the tested host is running bitcoind. Feeler connections exist only to test if the remote host to test is online. The feeler thread pulls the addresses to test from two sources:\n\nSource 1. Tried table collisions.\nA collision occurs when an address, addr1, is being moved to the tried table from the new table, but maps to a position in the tried table which already contains an address. This change ensures that during a collision, addr1 is not inserted into tried but instead inserted into a buffer. The to-be-evicted address, addr2, is then tested by the feeler thread. If addr2 is found to be online, we remove addr1 from the buffer and addr2 is not evicted, on the other hand if addr2 is found be offline it is replaced by addr1.\n\nSource 2. The new table.\nIf the feeler thread has no tried table collisions to be tested, it selects an address from the new table. It does this to grow the number of fresh (recently online) addresses in the tried table.\n# Advantages:\n- In our paper we sample several peer lists. We found that a large percentage of addresses in tried tables are stale IP addresses (the lowest was 72 percent stale, the highest was 95 percent stale), which increases the risk of eclipse attacks. This change remedies this by ensuring that the tried table grows quickly and contains many recently online addresses. Countermeasure 4 (feeler connections) strengthens countermeasure 3 (test-before-evict). \n- Another small side advantage is that, as no more than ten addresses can be in the test buffer at once, and addresses are only cleared one at a time from the test buffer, an attacker is forced to wait at least two minutes to insert a new address into tried after filling up the test buffer. This rate limits an attacker attempting to launch an eclipse attack.\n\nSee our paper for a full analysis of the benefits of these countermeasures.\n# Risk mitigation:\n- To prevent this functionality from being used as a DoS vector, we limit the number of addresses which are to be tested to ten. If we have more than ten addresses to test, we drop new addresses being added to tried if they would evict an address. Since the feeler thread only creates one new connection every 2 minutes the additional network overhead is limited.\n- An address in tried gains immunity from tests for 4 hours after it has been tested or successfully connected to.\n- To avoid issues of synchronization, the feeler thread sleeps for between 0 and 3 seconds prior to making a connection.\n# Tests:\n\nWe ran an instance with our changes for two days against our in house developed attack code to induce many collisions in the tried table.  Under these conditions we used valgrind to look for memory leaks. \nSee output of the test here:\n\n```\ne0@ubuntu:~/bitcoin-fork/src$ valgrind ./bitcoind -debug -printtoconsole -testnet > output.txt\n==1918== Memcheck, a memory error detector\n==1918== Copyright (C) 2002-2013, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.\n==1918== Using Valgrind-3.10.0.SVN and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info\n==1918== Command: ./bitcoind -debug -printtoconsole -testnet\n==1918==\n^C==1918==\n==1918== HEAP SUMMARY:\n==1918==     in use at exit: 3,864 bytes in 16 blocks\n==1918==   total heap usage: 224,281,816 allocs, 224,281,800 frees, 32,337,629,302 bytes allocated\n==1918==\n==1918== LEAK SUMMARY:\n==1918==    definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==1918==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==1918==      possibly lost: 304 bytes in 1 blocks\n==1918==    still reachable: 3,560 bytes in 15 blocks\n==1918==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks\n==1918== Rerun with --leak-check=full to see details of leaked memory\n==1918==\n==1918== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v\n==1918== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)\n```\n\nAs we have made some cosmetic code changes since this test was run we are rerunning this test and will update this pull request when it is finished. We are launching several test nodes.\n\nIf you want to test my code, and you don't want to simulate a large number of incoming connections, you need to generate a bunch of collisions that would trigger feeler connections. The way to do this is to reduce the the number of buckets in tried to 1. (That way, every address inserted into tried will have a high probability (at least p=1/64) to be a collision.) \n\naddrman_tests.cpp contains unit tests for the code I added to addrman.  As a small side note, because addrman bucket placement depends on a randomly chosen seed (nKey) I needed to\ncreate a method to set this seed to a known value so that the unit tests would be deterministic. This method is only available during the addrman unittests.\n",

Second, to implement the testing stage\nof the test-before-evict discipline.\n\nAdds tests to provide test coverage for these changes.\n\nThis change was suggested as Countermeasure 3 and 4 in\nEclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network, Ethan Heilman,\nAlison Kendler, Aviv Zohar, Sharon Goldberg. ePrint Archive Report\n2015/263.

          "body": "These changes implement countermeasures 3 (feeler connections) suggested in our paper: \"Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network\".\n# Design:\n\nWe observe that a node's resistance to eclipse attacks grows as the number of online addresses in the tried table grows. To increase the number of online addresses in the tried table the following logic is implemented in net.cpp's ThreadOpenConnections:\n1. Every 2 minutes a short lived _feeler connection_ is made to a randomly selected address in new.\n2. If the tested address is online and running bitcoind, this address is moved to the tried table.\n3. The feeler connection to the tested address is closed.\n\nOnly one feeler connection is attempted at any one time and feeler connections are only attempted after all outgoing connections slots of filled.\n# Advantages:\n- In our paper we sample several peer lists. We found that a large percentage of addresses in tried tables are stale IP addresses (the lowest was 72 percent stale, the highest was 95 percent stale). This large number of stale IP addresses increases the risk of eclipse attacks. This change remedies this by ensuring that the tried table grows quickly and contains many recently online addresses.\n- Not only do feeler connections provide a direct benefit to the node doing the testing but the tested node, if online, learns about our node and adds it to its tried table (conferring herd immunity even under partial deployment).\n- Countermeasure 3 (test-before-evict) builds on the feeler connections introduced in this change. This is the first step to deploying countermeasure 3.\n# Risk mitigation:\n- To limit the network impact of the feeler connections we only make one new connection every 2 minutes. Compared with other networking tasks that bitcoind performs the bandwidth increase is very slight.\n- To avoid issues of synchronization we introduce a random sleep of between 0 and 1000 milliseconds prior to making a feeler connection.\n- To avoid threading issues the feeler connections are made in the same thread as non-feeler connections.\n# Test plan:\n1. I'm currently running two EC2 nodes with public IP addresses. One is running this pull request and the other is running standard bitcoind. Both are running with arg -debug=1. At the end of the week I will post results from the logs looking at differences in the size of the tried table and examining the logs for any errors. I will also use the peer.dat files generated from this test to evaluate each nodes resistance to eclipse attacks.\n2. I will also use packet captures to ensure behavior and bandwidth behaves as expected.\n3. I invite anyone would like to help to run standard and feeler connection nodes and email me (Ethan.R.Heilman@gmail.com) the pcaps, logs and peers.dat files. I will post the results of this analysis here.\n\nThis change was suggested as Countermeasure 4 in\n[Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/263.pdf),\nEthan Heilman, Alison Kendler, Aviv Zohar, Sharon Goldberg.\nePrint Archive Report 2015/263.

          "body": "This change implement countermeasures 3 (test-before-evict) suggested in our paper: [\"Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network\"](http://cs-people.bu.edu/heilman/eclipse/).\n# Design:\n\nA collision occurs when an address, addr1, is being moved to the tried table from the new table, but maps to a position in the tried table which already contains an address (addr2). The current behavior is that addr1 would evict addr2 from the tried table.\n\nThis change ensures that during a collision, addr1 is not inserted into tried but instead inserted into a buffer (setTriedCollisions). The to-be-evicted address, addr2, is then tested by [a feeler connection](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8282). If addr2 is found to be online, we remove addr1 from the buffer and addr2 is not evicted, on the other hand if addr2 is found be offline it is replaced by addr1.\n\nAn additional small advantage of this change is that, as no more than ten addresses can be in the test buffer at once, and addresses are only cleared one at a time from the test buffer (at 2 minute intervals), thus an attacker is forced to wait at least two minutes to insert a new address into tried after filling up the test buffer. This rate limits an attacker attempting to launch an eclipse attack.\n# Risk mitigation:\n- To prevent this functionality from being used as a DoS vector, we limit the number of addresses which are to be tested to ten. If we have more than ten addresses to test, we drop new addresses being added to tried if they would evict an address. Since the feeler thread only creates one new connection every 2 minutes the additional network overhead is limited.\n- An address in tried gains immunity from tests for 4 hours after it has been tested or successfully connected to.\n# Tests:\n\nThis change includes additional addrman unittests which test this behavior.\n\nI ran an instance of this change with a much smaller tried table (2 buckets of 64 addresses) so that collisions were much more likely and observed evictions.\n\n```\n2016-10-27 07:20:26 Swapping 208.12.64.252:8333 for 68.62.95.247:8333 in tried table\n2016-10-27 07:20:26 Moving 208.12.64.252:8333 to tried\n```\n\nI documented tests we ran against similar earlier versions of this change in #6355.\n# Security Benefit\n\nThis is was originally posted in PR #8282 see [this comment for full details](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8282#issuecomment-237255215).\n\nTo determine the security benefit of these larger numbers of IPs in the tried table I modeled the attack presented in [Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/263).\n\n![attackergraph40000-10-1000short-line](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/274814/17366828/372af458-595b-11e6-81e5-2c9f97282305.png)\n\n**Default node:** 595 attacker IPs for ~50% attack success.\n**Default node + test-before-evict:** 620 attacker IPs for ~50% attack success.\n**Feeler node:** 5540 attacker IPs for ~50% attack success.\n**Feeler node + test-before-evict:** 8600 attacker IPs for ~50% attack success.\n\nThe node running feeler connections has 10 times as many online IP addresses in its tried table making an attack 10 times harder (i.e. requiring the an attacker require 10 times as many IP addresses in different /16s). Adding test-before-evict increases resistance of the node by an additional 3000 attacker IP addresses. \n\nBelow I graph the attack over even greater attacker resources (i.e. more attacker controled IP addresses). Note that test-before-evict maintains some security far longer even against an attacker with 50,000 IPs. If this node had a larger tried table test-before-evict could greatly boost a nodes resistance to eclipse attacks.\n\n![attacker graph long view](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/274814/17367108/96f46d64-595c-11e6-91cd-edba160598e7.png)\n",
