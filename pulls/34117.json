    "body": "Users running Bitcoin Core on home networks with routers that don't support PCP (Port Control Protocol) or NAT-PMP port mapping receive frequent warning-level log messages every few minutes:\r\n\r\n  \"pcp: Mapping failed with result NOT_AUTHORIZED (code 2)\"\r\n\r\nThis is expected behavior for many consumer routers that have PCP disabled by default, not an actionable error. The repeated warnings create unnecessary log noise.\r\n\r\nThis change:\r\n- Adds explicit constants for NOT_AUTHORIZED result code (value 2) for both NAT-PMP and PCP protocols\r\n- Downgrades NOT_AUTHORIZED failures from LogWarning to LogDebug since this is an expected condition on many networks\r\n- Keeps LogWarning for other failure types that may indicate actual configuration or network issues\r\n\r\nThe NOT_AUTHORIZED message will still be visible when running with -debug=net for users who need to troubleshoot port mapping issues.\r\n\r\nFixes #34114\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

The repeated warnings\ncreate unnecessary log noise.\n\nThis change:\n- Adds explicit constants for NOT_AUTHORIZED result code (value 2)\n  for both NAT-PMP and PCP protocols\n- Downgrades NOT_AUTHORIZED failures from LogWarning to LogDebug\n  since this is an expected condition on many networks\n- Keeps LogWarning for other failure types that may indicate\n  actual configuration or network issues\n\nThe NOT_AUTHORIZED message will still be visible when running with\n-debug=net for users who need to troubleshoot port mapping issues.\n\nFixes #34114",

      "message": "net: fix CJDNS address discovery when -externalip is set\n\nWhen -externalip is specified, Bitcoin Core disables automatic address\ndiscovery by setting fDiscover to false. This is intended to prevent\ndiscovery of IPv4/IPv6 addresses when the user already knows their\npublic IP.\n\nHowever, this also incorrectly prevented CJDNS addresses from being\ndiscovered and added to the local address list. CJDNS is a separate\noverlay network, and specifying an IPv4/IPv6 external IP should not\naffect CJDNS address advertising.\n\nThis fix modifies:\n1. Discover() - Continue processing CJDNS addresses even when fDiscover\n   is false, skipping only non-CJDNS addresses\n2. AddLocal() - Allow CJDNS addresses to be added even when discovery\n   is disabled, since they should still be advertised\n\nNow users running with -externalip and -cjdnsreachable will have their\nCJDNS address properly appear in local addresses and be logged via\nAddLocal(), matching the behavior when -externalip is not specified.\n\nFixes #33471",
