It is either like \"unsigned char\" by default or like \"signed char\" by default.\r\n> \r\n> Ideally, a portable program should always use \"signed char\" or \"unsigned char\" when it depends on the signedness of an object.  But many programs have been written to use plain \"char\" and expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the machines they were written for.\r\n> \r\n> This option, and its inverse, let you make such a program work with the opposite default. The type \"char\" is always a distinct type from each of \"signed char\" or \"unsigned char\", even though its behavior is always just like one of those two.\r\n",

In particular, it adds `_` as a thousands separator both before and after the decimal point, and aligns adjacent numeric fields via the decimal point. Since it's yaml, it uses a bit less syntax than json (ie, fewer quotes, no trailing commas, no brackets).\r\n\r\n(Looking for conceptACKs; it treads a cpp file as a header rather than making it a .o and doesn't allow yaml output via the gui debug console which would presumably make sense)",
