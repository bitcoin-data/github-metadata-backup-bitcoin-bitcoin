          "body": "Reduce compile-time memory usage by 2%, compilation time by 2% and avoid unnecessary recompiles by removing unused includes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe total accumulated max RSS usage is reduced by 2% (roughly -3564 MB, low variance measurement).\r\n\r\nThe total compilation time is reduced by 2% (roughly -73 seconds in user CPU time, slightly higher variance measurement).\r\n\r\nCommits:\r\n* Reduce memory usage during build by not including unused C++ standard library headers\r\n* Reduce memory usage during build by not including unused C compatibility headers\r\n* Reduce memory usage during build by not including unused headers (project local headers and headers for external dependencies)\r\n* Minimise includes and simplify header analysis/reasoning by splitting the `core_io.h` into the expected `core_read.h`/`core_write.h` (matching `core_read.cpp`/`core_write.cpp`)\r\n\r\nThe two first commits account for half of the speedup and the third commit account for the other half.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to the merged PR #16129 which reduced max RSS and compilation time by 2%.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nComparing max memory usage

Two commits building on top of this to add a persistent `-wallet` setting are pretty straightforward and show how the new code can be extended:\r\n\r\n* 70675c3e4975203ad6222ba2b00c83b4e4213793 from #15935 – _Add \\<datadir>/settings.json persistent settings storage_\r\n* 04c80c40df9fc6f4734ba238ea7f65607cf88089 from #15937 – _Add loadwallet and createwallet RPC load_on_startup options_",
