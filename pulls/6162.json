    "body": "This prevents an integer overflow during the difficulty retarget\ncalculation, and fixes a consensus-changing bug introduced by\ndf9eb5e14fa8072bc8a82b59e712c2ba36f13f4c.  While it is not possible to\nhit this consensus bug on mainnet or testnet3 due to the higher\ncurrent difficulties, it is easily hit on regtest after generating\n2016 blocks, forcing the retarget.\n\n~~Note: to convert between the arith_uint256 and arith_uint512 classes, I created a new static function in the base_uint base class that copies the data from one to the other.  However, to do this, I had to make the protected members `WIDTH` and `pn` public, so they could be accessed.  Not too happy with this, and I think that I need to use `friend` to allow access, but I'm not sure exactly how to do that.  Suggestions welcome.~~\n",

The difficulty retarget is needed in this case, or block generation timings on our network would not be as realistic as we need.\n\nIn the past, whenever we've talked about simnet in #bitcoin-dev, we've been told \"that sounds just like regtest, why not use that instead?\", so there are some people who do expect regtest to also work for simulation testing and long-lived private networks.  A network that always has the lowest possible difficulty would indeed be useful for some situations, but useless for others.\n\nAssumming the regtest retarget is kept, how would you incorporate the logic to use the 512-bit math only on regtest?  I'm all for avoiding touching working mainnet code, but tests become less and less useful the more special cases are made for the test environment.  In this case, I would think that sharing the difficulty retarget code on all networks is safest.\n",

The block tester tool does not generate enough blocks to hit the retarget interval, and I haven't seen any test cases anywhere which otherwise cover it.  Empirically, it works properly on mainnet and testnet, and naturally mainnet can be externally tested via an ASIC by disabling checkpoints, which are all good things.  However, I personally don't think it's a good idea to solely rely on human testing for consensus-related code.\n",

Retargets are not possible on regtest currently (and they used to be before commit df9eb5e14fa8072bc8a82b59e712c2ba36f13f4c).  Unfortunately, there is currently no test coverage which exercise the retarget code and is why this was able to go through.\n\nRepeating what I said above, I would also suggest that having a test for the retarget code which does not rely on special casing or branches specific to the network makes the most sense and is the least risky approach.  That is the approach this pull request takes.  It would appear @sipa agrees as he commented that it \"ideally means using the same code for both.\"\n\nThis isn't a theoretical issue.  We hit it because we were doing some testing with btcd and Bitcoin Core on regtest which involved retargets and noticed that btcd handles it correctly while Bitcoin Core does not even though they used to both handle it correctly in the past.  This creates a situation where 3rd-party software can't properly be tested across retarget intervals on the regression test network with Bitcoin Core.\n",
