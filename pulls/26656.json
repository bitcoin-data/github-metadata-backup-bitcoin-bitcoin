    "body": "When configured with `--enable-debug`, many tests become dramatically slower. These slow downs are particularly noticed in tests that generate a lot of blocks in separate calls, make a lot of RPC calls, or send a lot of data from the test framework's P2P connection. This PR aims to improve the runtime of some of the slower tests and improve the overall runtime of the test runner. This has improved the runtime of the test runner from ~400s to ~140s on my computer.\r\n\r\nThe slowest test by far was `wallet_import_rescan.py`. This was taking ~320s. Most of that time was spent waiting for blocks to be mined and then synced to the other nodes. It was generating a new block for every new transaction it was creating in a setup loop. However it is not necessary to have one tx per block. By mining a block only every 10 txs, the runtime is improved to ~61s.\r\n\r\nThe second slowest test was `feature_fee_estimation.py`. This test spends most of its time waiting for RPCs to respond. I was able to improve its runtime by batching RPC requests. This has improved the runtime from ~201s to ~140s.\r\n\r\nIn `feature_taproot.py`, the test was constructing a Python `CScript` using a very large list of `OP_CHECKSIG`s. The constructor for the Python implementation of `CScript` was iterating this list in order to create a `bytes` from it even though a `bytes` could be created from it without iterating. By making the `bytes` before passing it into the constructor, we are able to improve this test's runtime from ~131s to ~106s.\r\n\r\nAlthough `interface_rpc.py` was not typically a slow test, I found that it would occasionally have a super long runtime. It typically takes ~7s, but I have observed it taking >400s to run on occasion. This longer runtime occurs more often when `--enable-debug`. This long runtime was caused by the \"exceeding work queue\" test which is really just trying to trigger a race condition. In this test, it would create a few threads and try an RPC in a loop in the hopes that eventually one of the RPCs would be added to the work queue while another was processing. It used `getrpcinfo` for this, but this function is fairly fast. I believe what was happening was that with `--enable-debug`, all of the code for receiving the RPC would often take longer to run than the RPC itself, so the majority of the requests would succeed, until we got lucky after 10's of thousands of requests. By changing this to use a slow RPC, the race condition can be triggered more reliably, and much sooner as well. I've used `waitfornewblock` with a 500ms timeout. This improves the runtime to ~3s consistently.\r\n\r\nThe last test I've changed was `rpc_packages.py`. This test was one of the higher runtime variability tests. The main source of this variation appears to be waiting for the test node to relay a transaction to the test framework's P2P connection. By whitelisting that peer, the variability is reduced to nearly 0.\r\n\r\nLastly, I've reordered the tests in `test_runner.py` to account for the slower runtimes when configured with `--enable-debug`. Some of the slow tests I've looked at were listed as being fast which was causing overall `test_runner.py` runtime to be extended. This change makes the test runner's runtime be bounded by the slowest test (currently `feature_fee_estimation.py` with my usual config (`-j 60`).",

This could hold well when it was just a few outliers. But as CPFP is becoming common practice whether it is among wallets (#23074 has a few instances) or protocols (for instance the LN with anchor outputs), i'm afraid that if fees rise this can lead to significantly *underestimated* results.\r\nSee the first commit's message for details and #23074 for history.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a much simpler alternative to #23074. The point is to fix the issue before we come up with a reasonable way to track package feerates in the fee estimator.\r\n\r\nThe functional test is in a separate commit so reviewers can more easily cherry-pick it on master and see the fee estimator would return the wrong estimate.",

          "body": "This PR is a slightly modified version of #15836 (jonasschnelli):\r\n\r\n> This follows the approach of adding statistical information to Bitcoin Core that would otherwise be inefficient to calculate outside of the codebase.\r\n> \r\n> Adds an optional feerate histogram to `getmempoolinfo`.\r\n> \r\n> The concept and code is heavily inspired by the stats jhoenicke runs (https://github.com/jhoenicke/mempool, http://bitcoin-mempool.info).\r\n> \r\n> If someone has a good idea how to make the feerate-groups dynamic but also semi-constant for similar fee environments, please comment.\r\n> \r\n> If this is feature we'd like to have in master (concept ACKs), I'd continue this with writing tests.\r\n> \r\n> A simple plot of the data is [here](https://bitcointools.jonasschnelli.ch/mempool-histogram/).\r\n> RPC output sample is [here](https://gist.github.com/jonasschnelli/f5b8a701375c280b65842f44e4f6c046).\r\n\r\n<s>My attempts to contact jonasschnelli were, unfortunately, unsuccessful so I decided to create this PR in an attempt to move this forward.

          "title": "[Draft / POC] Silent Payments",
          "body": "This PR proposes an early version of [Silent Payment](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8) (author:@RubenSomsen).\r\nIn this scheme, the recipient generates a public address, but the sender tweaks the address and the recipient detects the payment by verifying all transactions on the blockchain. An example use case would be private donations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is not a final version, but to start the discussion and get benchmarks based on a real implementation.\r\n\r\nThis version is built on top of [#994](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/994) (bitcoin-core/secp256k1) for x-only ECDH support and #23480 (bitcoin/bitcoin) for `rawtr()`. Each new silent transaction detected is stored in wallet as a `rawtr()` descriptor. \r\n\r\nIn this implementation, the sender can tweak the recipient address by passing the `silent_payment` option to send RPC. The transaction output will be different from the address entered.\r\n\r\nFor example `./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named send outputs=\"[{\\\"bcrt1pwlh5xuyrpgfunwyww8cfu78yfs2yqyevl7yturavahh5kgxwdd2q5hzgfu\\\": 1.1}]\" fee_rate=1 options=\"{ \\\"silent_payment\\\": true}\"`.\r\n\r\nwill generate `vout` with completely unrelated outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"vout\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 1.10000000,\r\n      \"n\": 0,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(65b19890c5ca40edb816d26f5f48cd9f3ed51121613b1c2405adc1a6dbbc824a)#8myx9tcu\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pvkce3yx9efqwmwqk6fh47jxdnuld2yfpvya3cfq94hq6dkausf9qrfjkgz\",\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 2.02499835,\r\n      \"n\": 1,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(c45cb3d500bbf8f0c8841e8e011b008781d826c16ee348edb822c0f97419bc4d)#26hcce63\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pc3wt84gqh0u0pjyyr68qzxcqs7qasfkpdm353mdcytq0jaqeh3xsuvlykg\",\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny wallet, as long as it has access to private keys, can send silent payments. Thus, this excludes watch-only wallets or wallets with external signers .\r\n\r\nBut the recipient's wallet needs a new flag called `SILENT_PAYMENT`. This flag allows an additional scan that verifies that the wallet keys match the silent payment scheme. When it detects a silent payment that belongs to the wallet, it is stored in a `rawtr()` descriptor.\r\n\r\n`./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named createwallet wallet_name=\"recipient\" silent_payment=true`\r\n\r\nTherefore, scanning each address for each transaction is potentially prohibitive overhead, so the node can be initialized with `keypool=1` or a descriptor with range [0,1] can be imported into a blank wallet. Until there is more benchmark data, it is the safest option. The proposal recommends one static address.\r\n\r\nI've been running some silent payments on signet using wallets with default keypool and default range, I haven't noticed any relevant performance drops on the signet node.\r\nApparently this implementation is working as expected but I can't guarantee that the scheme is implemented correctly or safely, so I'm opening this PR for reviews, modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nThere is a new functional test (`test/functional/wallet_silentpayment.py`) that can help to better understand the implementation.",

It looks like there's a lot of commits, but **only the last 12 commits belong in this PR**. The rest will be merged with upstream PRs.\r\n\r\nThe dependency tree for BIP324 PRs is [here](https://bip324.com/sections/code-review/).\r\n\r\nBIP324 is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n### Running a v2 node\r\n#### Get the code\r\n```\r\ngit remote add bip324 git@github.com:dhruv/bitcoin.git\r\ngit fetch bip324\r\ngit checkout bip324/bip324-enable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build for your OS\r\n\r\nFollow the appropriate instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Run the node\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoind -conf=CONFIG_FILE -v2transport=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Connect with a friend's v2 node\r\n```\r\nsrc/bitcoin-cli -conf=CONFIG_FILE addnode \"FRIEND_IP:FRIEND_PORT\" \"add\" true\r\n```\r\nThe last parameter(`p2p_v2:true`) signals to your node that the peer is running a v2 supportive client and we should attempt to make an encrypted P2P connection (you're simulating the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag advertisement manually). Should that fail however (say because the peer told you mistakenly, lied, etc.), this code will downgrade the connection to unencrypted v1 transport.\r\n\r\n### Things you are helpful to test\r\n\r\n* If your friend's node is a v2 node, you can see with wireshark that the bytes are pseudorandom (the easiest way to confirm this is that with a v1 connection, wireshark will tell you it has detected a Bitcoin connection and it'll even parse out the metadata like message type, etc; with v2, wireshark has no idea -- of course that _could_ be because wireshark does simply not know v2, but it is because the bytestream is pseudorandom)\r\n* Compare the v2 encrypted session id exposed via `getpeerinfo` as `v2_session_id` with your friend.\r\n* Add another peer that is actually v1, but try `addnode` still indicating v2 support. You should see with wireshark that after a failed attempt at a v2 handshake, the connection is downgraded to unencrypted v1 and wireshark can parse it.\r\n\r\nI've been told there are v2 nodes running at (happy to update the list as more people run persistent v2 nodes; message me and I'll add it here):\r\n```\r\nbe.anyone.eu.org\r\nrp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333\r\njdcoysubtxazi7dketpyb5rnjorvxad4onftveohash2pdwkgw4bvnqd.onion:8333\r\nxci6cphki2pdb5qe7axzrcxcxabkbm24z4zlv2hn4ziy6grquqco2kyd.onion:8333\r\nslvtesfgg3mkksqqzh67al4sq6dx3rhlzqepa4ny7jonzuckg6msf3id.onion:8333\r\ngifm4fnj3vua664xhgeanx5fnpco3txkqy4amr4txbfsciiyrkxpf2qd.onion:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::3:8333\r\n300:5ecb:6b8a:d837::a6d6:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1a:365::2:8333\r\n2001:470:1f1b:365:aa20:66ff:fe3f:1909:8333\r\n184.74.240.157:8533\r\n95.179.145.232:8333\r\n```",

They'll all be removed when the parent PRs get merged.\r\n\r\n### commits overview\r\n1. Introducing cryptographic constructs(HKDF, ECDH, ChaCha20, Poly1305, FSChaCha20 and FSChaCha20Poly1305) in the test framework to help with P2P encryption.\r\n2. Performing v2 P2P encryption in a v2 connection.\r\n    * introduces a new class `EncryptedP2PState` to store the keys, functions for performing the initial v2 handshake and encryption/decryption.\r\n    * this class is used by `P2PConnection` in inbound/outbound connections to perform the initial v2 handshake before the v1 version handshake. Only after the initial v2 handshake is performed do application layer P2P messages(version, verack etc..) get exchanged. (in a v2 connection)\r\n    * the encrypted P2P messages follow a different format - 3 byte length + 1-13 byte message_type + payload + 16 byte MAC\r\n    * includes support for testing decoy messages and v2 connection downgrade(using false advertisement - when a v2 node makes an outbound connection to a node which doesn't support v2 but is advertised as v2 by some malicious\r\nintermediary)\r\n\r\n### run the tests\r\n* functional test - `test/functional/p2p_v2_encrypted.py` `test/functional/p2p_v2_earlykeyresponse.py`\r\n\r\nI'm also super grateful to @ dhruv for his really valuable feedback on this branch.",
