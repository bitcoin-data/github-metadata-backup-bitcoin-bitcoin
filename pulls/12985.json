    "body": "The Bitcoin Core NSIS script runs with elevated privileges.  Unfortunately, this means that it launches Bitcoin Core itself with elevated privileges when the user chooses to launch Bitcoin Core at the end of the installation procedure.  This PR works around the issue by having `explorer.exe` launch Bitcoin Core.  Seems to be a similar approach to what http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ShellExecAsUser_plug-in does, but without a plugin.\r\n\r\nI've tested this with Sysinternals Process Explorer on Windows 10 32-bit.  I wouldn't expect any differences in behavior on other Windows releases, but if anyone would like to test on other Windows releases, feel free.\r\n\r\nh/t to \"UK\" at https://mdb-blog.blogspot.se/2013/01/nsis-lunch-program-as-user-from-uac.html?showComment=1410158039989#c2463780017054126736 for the sample code.\r\n\r\nFixes #7990.",

Unfortunately, this means that it launches Bitcoin Core itself with elevated privileges when the user chooses to launch Bitcoin Core at the end of the installation procedure.

Seems to be a similar approach to what http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ShellExecAsUser_plug-in does, but without a plugin.\n\nh/t to \"UK\" at https://mdb-blog.blogspot.se/2013/01/nsis-lunch-program-as-user-from-uac.html?showComment=1410158039989#c2463780017054126736 for the sample code.\n\nFixes #7990.\n",
