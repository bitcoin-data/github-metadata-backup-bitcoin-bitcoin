    "body": "PR'ing into 0.21 because I don't think we want a hack like this in master.\r\n\r\nClang fixed a determinism bug in the 9.x series: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/db101864bdc938deb1d63fe4f7da761bd38e5cae\r\n\r\nIt was never backported to 8.x, however. I have manually back-ported the fix to 8.x here in case it's useful (with Guix, for example): https://github.com/theuni/llvm-project/commit/df4158d8577618c1f728f89ca88aad5eead656a7\r\n\r\nCredit Carl Dong for discovering the determinism problem while working on Guix.\r\n\r\nClang 8.x emits non-deterministic code, but only with certain compile options enabled (-O2 is fine but -O3 is problematic; I haven't tracked down the exact guilty flag), and only when compiling very specific code.\r\n\r\nQt builds with -O3, so we special-case the source file that manages to trigger the bug and force it to -O2. gcc/clang honor the _last_ -O option, so appending is fine.\r\n\r\nI suspect @fanquake will hate the fact that we're echoing into a generated file. This would be much cleaner if done at the qmake level, but I'm not sure how to do that.\r\n\r\nThis is a quick nasty work-around, so here are some other potential options:\r\n- Bump to clang9 where this is fixed\r\n- As @dongcarl suggested: rewrite the some of the qt function (`qt_intersect_spans` in qpaintengine_raster.cpp) to avoid hitting the non-determinism\r\n- Disable the buggy behavior via cmdline option\r\n\r\nI've opted for the last option (Using -O2 as a large hammer), because it was the quickest to write, but the second option would be fine as well. I don't have much of a preference, this is a huge layer violation either way. :)\r\n\r\nI'd prefer not to bump clang this late in the release process, though.",

I have manually back-ported the fix to\n8.x here:\nhttps://github.com/theuni/llvm-project/commit/df4158d8577618c1f728f89ca88aad5eead656a7\n\nCredit Carl Dong for discovering the determinism problem while working on Guix.\n\nClang 8.x emits non-deterministic code, but only with certain compile options\nenabled (-O2 is fine but -O3 is problematic), and only when compiling very\nspecific code.\n\nQt builds with -O3, so we special-case the source file that manages to trigger\nthe bug and force it to -O2. gcc/clang honor the _last_ -O option, so appending\nis fine.",
