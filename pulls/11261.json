ISO/IEC 14882:2011, Annex C, C.3.1:\r\n> For compatibility with the Standard C library, the C++ standard library provides the 18 C headers (D.5), but their use is _deprecated_ in C++.\r\n\r\n2. ibid, Annex D, D.5:\r\n> Every C header, each of which has a name of the form `name.h`, behaves as if each name placed in the standard library namespace by the corresponding `cname` header is placed within _the global namespace_ scope.\r\n\r\n> [ _Example:_ The header `<cstdlib>` assuredly provides its declarations and definitions within the namespace `std`. It may also provide these names within the global namespace. The header `<stdlib.h>` assuredly provides the same declarations and definitions within the global namespace, much as in the C Standard. It may also provide these names within the namespace `std`. — _end example_ ]\r\n",
