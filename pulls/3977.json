    "body": "There are proposals in the pipeline, and some currently deployed applications which require commitments of special forms of data to the blockchain by miners. For example, merged mining requires each block to have a data commitment at a single deterministically identifiable position. UTXO hash-tree commitments adds the root hash of a Merkle tree of the current validation state at a similarly known or identifiable position such that clients using such an index structure can acquire UTXO proofs with SPV security. Compact SPV proofs require commitments of a Merkle heap or skip list structure of past block headers, for the purpose of constructing traversals through the block headers with logarithmic scaling in space. All of these miner-commitment applications require to varying degrees three essential properties:\n1. _A unique or identifiable place within the block where the commitment is to be placed_. For a given commitment type the miner must know where to put the commitment into a block template, someone using it must know where to find it within a block or its Merkle proof (the transaction containing the commitment, the path to the transaction through the Merkle tree of the block, and the block header).\n2. _Impossible for a miner to create multiple block commitments of the same type within the context of a single block_. A user given just the transaction containing the commitment, its path through the Merkle tree, and the block header must have confidence that the commitment is of the indicated type, and the only one of that type in the block.\n3. _Compact commitment proofs_. The transaction containing the commitment should contain no more information than is necessary to uniquely identify the commitment type and the commitment itself, so as to minimize the size of commitment Merkle proofs. Achieving this property directly benefits protocols built on top of data commitments.\n\nThe only extant example of miner commited data in Bitcoin Core is BIP 34, which add the block height to the coinbase string in order to ensure coinbase transaction uniqueness. Higher level protocols such as p2pool and namecoin's merged mining also require commitments via the coinbase transaction. However such schemes fail to meet one or more of the properties above, especially the requirement for compact commitment proofs: coinbase transactions can be unreasonably large due to mining pool payout schedules and the increasing amount of data being stuffed in the coinbase string.\n\nAn alternative is to use transactions of a special form, and a separate transaction for each commitment. These commitment transactions have a single input whose scriptSig consists of a single data push, the contents of which is the commitment type:\n\n```\nscriptPubKey: <type> OP_EQUAL\nscriptSig:    <type>\n```\n\nThe outputs of the transaction are available for prune-able OP_RETURN data commitments. In order to meet requirement #1 and #2, a soft-fork validation rule is added such that any block containing two such special-form transactions with the same commitment type is rejected, and the anyone-can-spend outputs of the form `<type> OP_EQUAL` must be present for each required commitment, in order to provide an output to be spent COINBASE_MATURITY blocks later. It is suggested that one data commitment be set aside for the purpose of document timestamping, merged mining, and other applications which do not need additional validation rules. This patchset sets aside the `OP_0` commitment type for this purpose.\n",

      "body": "And immediately after making the pull request I realize half of it is missing - CreateNewBlock needs to be updated to create the required commitment outputs. I will make that fix.\n\n@luke-jr: Any required commitment increases the block size linearly, by the very nature of what you are doing. By adding a commitment to a block you have to at the very least add the bytes of the hash you are committing. This does it in a way which is more performant and immediately pruned from the UTXO set. And I think you may have misread req 1. My intent was that given the entire block or some transaction(s) in a Merkle proof, you know what to scan for to find the commitment.\n\nThe best system for coinbase commitments is p2pool's method. Such an approach is really not ideal. Beyond midstate being an ugly hack (not the least because some library SHA-256 implementations don't expose the necessary functionality to verify), it is also not performant. It would require the proofs to carry 32 bytes of midstate data, plus an average of 32 bytes of data prior to the commitment, and some metadata to indicate the start of the commitment within the string. That is 65 bytes of overhead plus the commitments which follow that you don't care about, which could be sizable in itself. This is a rather large waste of space, especially for applications which demand compact proofs, e.g. merged mining headers and compact spv proofs.\n",

      "body": "Well a proof is just 80 bytes block header + untaken Merkle paths + extra data at the (sub-)transaction level + a few bytes metadata. So for just the coinbase and one commitment that is 80 + 32 + 1-2 bytes. That's about 50% increase on a minimal block, but percentage-wise that's a worst case since the overhead is constant but the proof size increases logarithmically with the number of transactions. With a 1000 transactions in the block it is a 16% increase. Still significant.\n\nUsing the coinbase transaction with midstate also has one other glaring problem: you are unprotected from length-extension attacks. You can't know for certain if the string given is actually a commitment, or just something that looks like it inside of a giant PUSHDATA. This can be somewhat mitigated against with economic arguments by using radix trees with a single root commitment, making this root commitment required, and making it illegal to put anything after it in the coinbase transaction. Then at least any PUSHDATA trickery would also invalidate the block.\n\nUsing a radix tree with a single exposed root hash (in the coinbase or its own transaction) is less space efficient for proofs, because if they are separate transactions then you can put them consecutively and align on a corresponding power-of-2 boundary in order to reduce the number of transaction-tree Merkle branches required, vs. the radix tree approach which doesn't let you save space from the transaction Merkle tree and requires new untaken branches for commitments you don't care about (whereas that would otherwise be amortized over the size of the transaction list). It's also messier because you've added (1) the radix tree implementation (although, yes, I want that for other purposes), and (2) the tree data still needs to be transported with the block, since validation rules will depend on these commitments being correct (e.g. [U]TXO hash-tree commitments). You'd have to include the serialized radix tree in the p2p block message, on disk in the block files, and anywhere else in the bitcoin ecosystem which transmits or archives full blocks for consumption by a validator. That's a lot more code to change, and a bigger disruption to the bitcoin ecosystem.\n",

      "body": "A while ago I started writing [this proposal for MM2 (merged mining 2)](https://github.com/forrestv/mm2-spec), which is essentially the \"radix tree with single exposed root hash\" maaku described, which fulfills all three of his required properties, and which P2Pool is already using. The rest of this comment mostly summarizes things that have already been said.\n\nAdmittedly, using the midstate is a bit hackish, but it isn't vulnerable to a length-extension attack, as maaku said, since there's only one root commitment hash fixed at the end of the coinbase transaction.\n\nTo conclude, everything's possible without a Bitcoin rule change, without creating any new transactions and using constant space in Bitcoin blocks, at the expense of about (64 bytes) + (32 bytes)*log2(number of types of commitments present in a block) for every block used in a commitment proof. (If the commitment root were padded so that it starts on a SHA-block boundary, the 64 bytes would decrease to 32 bytes, wasting on average about 32 bytes in every Bitcoin block.)\n\nThe other wrinkle is that if Bitcoin miners started validating the UTXO commitment, (only) the relevant Merkle branch within the radix tree would have to be forwarded around the Bitcoin network among nodes that care, requiring database and protocol changes for them.\n",

It would be possible to create a commitment that validating miners would treat as not a commitment at all, by stuffing it in a PUSHDATA. In the same vein, you'd need to make sure that a block doesn't have a commitment for a certain validation type if you think the block doesn't have it, which would be difficult to prove with P2Pool's approach.\n\nFor commitments that will require validation (SPV/non-SPV UTXO trees), P2Pool's solution is probably not the best choice.

          "title": "Add a getutxos command to the p2p protocol",
          "body": "# Introduction\n\nThe getutxo command allows querying of the UTXO set given a set of of outpoints. It has a simple implementation and the results are not authenticated in any way. Despite this, there are times when it is a useful capability to have. I believe @jgarzik also has a use case for this, though I don't know what it is.\n\nAs a motivating example I present Lighthouse, an app I'm writing that implements assurance contracts:\n\nhttp://blog.vinumeris.com/2014/05/17/lighthouse/\n\nLighthouse works by collecting _pledges_, which contain an invalid transaction signed with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY. Once sufficient pledges are collected to make the combination valid, we say the contract is complete and it can be broadcast onto the network, spending the pledged outputs. Before that occurs however, a pledge can be _revoked_ and the pledged money redeemed by double spending the pledged output. For instance you might want to do this if it becomes clear not enough people care about the assurance contract for it to reach its goal in a timely manner, or if you simply need the money back due to some kind of cashflow crunch. \n\nIt is convenient to be able to see when a pledge has been revoked, so the user interface can be updated, and so when the final contract is created revoked pledges can be left out. For this purpose \"getutxos\" is used.\n# Protocol\n\nThe getutxos message takes a boolean which controls whether outputs in the memory pool are considered, and a vector of COutPoint structures. It returns a bitmap with the same number of bits as outputs specified rounded up to the nearest 8 bits, and then a list of CTxOut structures, one for each set bit in the bitmap. The bitmap encodes whether the UTXO was found (i.e. is indeed unspent).\n# Authentication\n\nThe results of getutxos is not authenticated. This is because the obvious way to do this requires the work maaku has been doing on UTXO commitments to be merged, activated by default, miners to upgrade and a forking change made to enforce their accuracy. All this is a big project that may or may not ever come to fruition.\n\nFor the Lighthouse security model however, this doesn't matter much. The reason is that the pledge transactions you're getting (which may be malicious) don't come from the P2P network. They come in the form of files either from a simple rendezvous server, or e.g. a shared folder or email attachments. The people sending these files have no way to influence the choice of peers made by the app. Once the outputs are returned, they are used to check the signatures on the pledge, thus verifying that the pledge spends the UTXO returned by the P2P network.\n\nSo we can be attacked in the following ways:\n- The pledge may be attempting to pledge non-existent outputs, but this will be detected if the majority of peers are honest.\n- The peers may be malicious and return a wrong or bogus output, but this will be detected when the signature is checked, except for the value (!) but we want to fix this by including the value into the sighash at some point anyway because we need it to make the TREZOR efficient/faster.\n- The peers may bogusly claim no such UTXO exists when it does, but this would result in the pledge being seen as invalid. When the project creator asks the pledgor why they revoked their money, and learns that in fact they never did, the bogus peers will be detected. No money is at risk as the pledges cannot be spent.\n- If the pledgor AND all the peers collaborate (i.e. the pledgor controls your internet connection) then they can make you believe you have a valid pledge when you don't. This would result in the app getting \"jammed\" and attempting to close an uncloseable contract. No money is at risk and the user will eventually wonder why their contract is not confirming. Once they get to a working internet connection the subterfuge will be discovered.\n\nThere is a final issue: the answer to getutxos can of course change the instant the result is generated, thus leading you to construct an uncloseable transaction if the process of revocation races with the construction. The app can detect this by watching for either a reject message, or an inv requesting one of the inputs that is supposed to be in the UTXO set (i.e. the remote peer thinks it's an orphan). This can then cause the app to re-request the UTXO set and drop the raced pledge.\n\nIn practice I do not anticipate such attacks are likely to occur, as they're complicated to pull off and it's not obvious what the gain is.\n\nThere may be other apps that wish to use getutxos, with different security models. They may find this useful despite the lack of UTXO commitments, and the fact that the answer can change a moment later, if:\n- They are connecting to a trusted peer, i.e. localhost.\n- They trust their internet connection and peer selection, i.e. because they don't believe their datacenter or ISP will commit financial fraud against them, or they are tunnelling via endpoints they trust like a randomly chosen Tor exit.\n- They are not using the response for anything important or worth attacking, like some kind of visualisation.\n# Upgrade\n\nIf enforced UTXO commitments are added to the block chain in future, it would make sense to rev the P2P protocol to add the proofs (merkle branches) to the response.\n# Testing\n\nI attempted to write unit tests for this, but Core has no infrastructure for building test chains .... the miner_tests.cpp code does it but at the cost of not allowing any other unit test to do so, as it doesn't reset or clean up the global state afterwards! I tried to fix this and ended up down a giant rabbit hole.\n\nSo instead I've tested it with a local test app I wrote, which also exercises the client side part in bitcoinj.\n# BIP\n\nIf the code is ACKd then I will write a short BIP explaining the new message.\n# Philosophy\n\nOn IRC I have discussed this patch a little bit before. One objection that was raised is that we shouldn't add anything to the P2P protocol unless it's unattackable, because otherwise it's a sharp knife that people might use to cut themselves.\n\nI personally disagree with this notion for the following reasons. \n\nFirstly, many parts of the P2P protocol are not completely unattackable:  malicious remote nodes can withhold broadcast transactions, invent fictional ones (you'd think they're orphans), miss out Bloom filter responses, send addr messages for IP's that were never announced, etc. We shouldn't hold new messages to a standard existing messages don't meet.\n\nSecondly, even with UTXO commitments in the block chain, given the sick state of mining this only requires a collaboration of two people to undo, although that failure would be publicly detectable which is at least something. But anyway, there's a clean upgrade path if/when UTXO authentication becomes available.\n\nThirdly, we have a valid use case that's actually implemented. This isn't some academic pie in the sky project.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin is already the sharpest knife imaginable. I don't think we should start rejecting useful features on the grounds that someone else might screw up with them.\n\nIf the above analysis ends up not holding for some reason, and people do get attacked due to the lack of authentication, then Lighthouse and other apps can always fall back to connecting to trusted nodes (perhaps over SSL). But I would like to optimistically assume success up front and see what happens, than pessimistically assume the worst and centralise things up front.\n",

On the other hand, @maaku's scheme is flawed in that such a proof can _never_ be created. (modulo providing the entire block!)\n\nIn any case since then I've written a library for creating such commitment proofs: https://github.com/petertodd/python-merbinnertree. Plenty more work to do on it, but @phantomcircuit has already been looking into using it for MM-like commitments.\n",

      "body": "BTW (U)TXO commitments are a concrete example where this is useful. A soft-fork to make (U)TXO commitments always required is problematic, because we can't change the format of those commitments in the future in another soft-fork - the exact form is baked in stone. However we can do a slightly less drastic soft-fork to require (U)TXO commitments to be valid, while still allowing miners to choose to not make the commitment. In this case the miners who chose not to calculate the commitment would provide a short and simple proof that the commitment didn't exist in their block. Completing the upgrade would be another soft-fork to _require_ that the commitment not exist, thus upgrading the (U)TXO format and allowing the related code and indexes to be eventually removed.\n",

      "body": "kerami, using the transaction ordering is doable, but fairly ugly in my own opinion. It is also strictly speaking less capable as it doesn't allow for frictionless non-consensus commitments--with the current solution you can pick a random UUID as the commitment type and have some assurance against namespace collision. I have to admit this isn't a strong argument however, as it is not clear to me that such an applicaiton would be useful.\n\nMore seriously, it's hard to avoid the spend-a-coinbase-output scheme however. The inputs need to be restricted such that no fees can be given, otherwise you break the secuirty model by opening up the possibility of paying for incorrect or malicious commitments. In the coinbase commitment scheme this is trivial -- the one and only input is an anyone-can-spend. If you instead specify commitment type by position, then you still need at least one input by protocol rules, but because it is not required to be an anyone-can-spend you've now got to either make the same arbitrary restrictions on input value, or worry about economic attacks..\n",

The idea that avoiding in-band fee payments will help anything in the real world is silly.\n",
