    "body": "This PR' aim is to improve user experience around stuck transactions without\r\naffecting users of zero conf transactions.\r\n\r\ntldr: Allow transaction replacement for transactions sitting in mempool for\r\nlonger than timeout (default 6h configurable) regardless of opt-in replacement\r\nflag.\r\n\r\nThis PR affects policy/relay only.\r\n\r\nStuck transactions have been a problem for users recently. While wallets\r\nare improving (opt in replacement, Child Pays For Parent, etc) there are some\r\ncases which find users with transactions stuck for days that can't be solved\r\neasily/reliably by wallet developers, especially when the user creates the\r\nstuck transaction with old software or for some reason disabled available\r\nfeatures countering stuck transactions.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the below I will ignore transactions created by the core\r\nwallet when talking about transaction expiration/eviction and focus on policy.\r\n\r\nBitcoin 0.12 introduced (or in a way re-introduced) opt-in transaction\r\nreplacement (BIP125), allowing people to more explicitly flag that their\r\ntransaction can be replaced (such that users of zero conf transactions can\r\nimmediately recognize them).\r\n\r\nAt the same time mempool limiting (configurable) was introduced, making the\r\nindividual mempool drop transactions at the bottom (low fee) when full.\r\n\r\nBoth before and after these changes any transaction in mempool would be\r\nautomatically evicted after 72 hours (configurable).\r\n\r\nRecently 0.14.0 increased the eviction from 72 hours to 2 weeks. These changes\r\nallows users of the system to aim for lower fees but at the same time makes it\r\nfrustrating for users that disable opt-in transaction replacement or that use\r\nsoftware that doesn't support it in first place to bump the fee at a later time\r\nor to revert the payment as they have to wait for a while or use ad-hoc\r\nsoftware.\r\n\r\nA number of miners will mine transactions regardless of opt-in flags (5-10%\r\nmaybe) and while core nodes won't propagate those transactions, a well\r\nconnected user can generally get replacement transactions mined within a\r\nreasonable amount of time without opt-in transaction replacement flags set.\r\n\r\nThis may be convenient for attackers or ad-hoc expert use but\r\nnot ideal for wallet developers, or at least until core merges full transaction\r\nreplacement because using this functionality would requires wallets to use\r\npreferential peering and/or forks of bitcoin core.\r\n\r\nUntil then a compromise solution that doesn't impact zero conf use and that\r\nimproves user experience would be to allow transactions to be replaced after\r\nsitting for a timeout in mempool (thus unconfirmed).\r\n\r\nThe timeout should be high enough that allows current use of zero conf and at\r\nthe same time allows same working day solution for users.\r\nI suggest a 6 hours timeout and to have it configurable for testing and ability\r\nfor user to change.\r\n\r\nThe changes continue to support disabling entirely transaction replacement\r\n(-mempoolreplacement) and introduces a new command line parameter\r\n(-mempoolreplacementtimeout) which allows to pass the number of seconds after\r\nwhich a transaction can be unconditionally replaced and setting this parameter\r\nto two weeks will keep the original behavior.\r\n\r\nIf you want to test the changes using @petertodd Replace-by-Fee tools build\r\ncore with this PR applied and wallet enabled and run with\r\n-mempoolreplacementtimeout=10 and use doublespend.py (with and without\r\n -b 1) from https://github.com/petertodd/replace-by-fee-tools",

I also don't think we should start going in that direction, as node policy is potentially subject to random changes. Whereas the BIP process is meant to document or propose changes and then more or less \"freeze\" the proposal after adoption.\r\n\r\nThe only BIPs related to policy are feefilter and rbf125. Both of them needed some sort of coordination across the network, i.e. new protocol message or a new way to interpret a field in a tx. Those are on-off changes, i.e. either you support the new protocol message or you don't/either you interpret the field in this specific way or you don't. Whereas, setting local tx pool policy does not need to be coordinated across the network.",

I also made the wallet part and rpc part off by default such that it can be turned on once the network upgrades in a second release (and perhaps remove entirely the config option as I configured it as debug_only, won't show up w/ -help)\r\n\r\nThis means that unless a user sets -enablewalletreplacementtimeout=1 (0 by default) they won't see transaction rbfable via rpc/gui wallet.

      "body": "Adding 2 cents:\r\n\r\nThe 6h limit seems arbitrary. For transactions that come in the hours after 9AM ET when Bitmex does their dump the network is vastly different than at other times.\r\n\r\nCurrent state of things is that the mempool clears out overnight almost every night. Hasn't been for _very_ long that it hasn't cleared out after two nights. \r\n\r\nWe accept 0-conf at Bitrefill (with certain checks of course), for several years, very successfully, and despite not advertising that we do, it the expectation of users is that 0-conf should work. In times when we've had to raise the minimum fee on 0-conf transactions we get support tickets from confused users. Quite a few (50%?) of users still pay from custodial services where they don't control the settings of the transactions being sent. We frequently have transactions lying around until they clear out overnight with no issue. \r\n\r\nA limit of 72h would maybe be acceptable in this regard, but would need to be weighed against other considerations, from a utilitiarian perspective the question is weighing how many transactions this improves the experience for and how many it makes things worse.\r\n\r\nWe also need to remember that we currently have opt-in RBF, so wallets and services that choose to support replacing can simply just set that flag. I don't want to reignite the big RBF and 0-conf debate, but it seems like we have a reasonable compromise that there is clear opt-in RBF that is used by some, who then clearly declare that they don't want their transactions to be accepted unconfirmed, and other transactions where it is up to the recipient of the transactions to chose whether to accept those transactions.\r\nSo for this feature it would require wallets that can deal with replacement in a good way, yet don't have the foresight of setting the RBF flag. My gut is that the number of those transactions is much lower than the number of transactions impacted by the complexity introduced by us needing to deal with this.  ",

Perhaps it would be meaningful to not replace transactions that have been CPFP'd. But that too adds more complexity. ",

      "body": "Another argument in favor of 6 hours is that if even 3% of miners support full RBF then 6 hours is plenty of time for even a fairly lazy attacker to double spend. Although this pull request could impact that likeliness, because it's easier to reach those miners.\r\n\r\nIt may be that, as @ziggamon's points out, it's a bit contrived to build a feature that's essentially for wallets that support RBF, but leave it off by default. That scenario seems more likely than one where a user decides to upgrade to a better wallet while experiencing a stuck transaction.\r\n\r\nAlthough it doesn't solve the same use case, I do like the idea of a 24-72 hour delay, because  transactions that are so far down the queue tend to leave the mempool anyway. That can cause people to incorrectly believe their transaction is \"cancelled\". Or conversely their wallet will hold on to it forever, but never propagating, so the recipient can't even CPFP it. Making it easier to really cancel such a transaction, by double spending yourself back to your own wallet, could be useful even for wallets that don't support RBF.",

Is this just motivated by either speculation on actual behaviour without measuring it or a distributed systems misunderstanding that causes people to not just set replacement in the first place?",

Just unload the wallet and delete mempool.dat before calling `sendrawtransaction`.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think my example is a good use case. The reason the initial transaction didn't use RBF is because it was created with RPC and I forgot to set `walletrbf=1`. I also just noticed `walletcreatefundedpsbt` default  `replaceable` argument ignores this setting (#15878).",

      "body": "Before going through the code, Is there any consensus on whether this is a good idea at all? Reminding of the debate around opt-in RBF. The opponents' argument was that it would lead to a slippery slope and removing 0-conf entirely. This seems like a step in this direction. Like it or not it is successfully used to a large extent, not just by our users.\r\n\r\nLet's evaluate some situations:\r\na) In status quo (i.e. mempool clears out almost every night) there is no need for this.\r\n\r\nb) In a state where the mempool is non-empty for long periods of time this creates a situation that potentially worsens a fee crisis by making it so that merchants must CPFP transactions to fit within the 72h (or whichever window), which potentially can lead to trampling for the exits at the exact wrong time, causing fees to spike further. Large amounts of automated code outbidding eachother for limited space is part of the reason for why we had the fee problem in 2017 in the first place.\r\n\r\nCPFP here also becomes a vector for abuse per the following: Anyone can make a large consolidation transaction that includes a send to a party that does CPFP on incoming tx's within 72h => Externalize the costs of confirming this consolidation to someone else, which in this scenario is expensive. \r\n\r\n - Question here: Would a child transaction prevent this from running or would it run regardless? Or is there some other mechanism by which a recipient could disable this functionality?\r\n\r\nCan somebody describe a specific scenario where a user would benefit from this change in network policy? Is this a user that uses an RBF wallet, but chooses to have RBF disabled but then changes his mind? Or is it a user that upgrades wallets in order to access this feature post-fact? Can we estimate the potential benefit and weigh against the potential damage?\r\n\r\nI agree with John that we should separate policy aspects here from wallet aspects. Bitcoind policy for propagation is not consensus but largely goes unchanged so usually becomes a sort of de facto consensus. ",

      "body": "> Is there any consensus on whether this is a good idea at all?\r\n\r\nNo, I don't think consensus has been reached. The fact that you have legitimate concerns about it shows that we don't have consensus!\r\n\r\n> In status quo (i.e. mempool clears out almost every night) there is no need for this.\r\n\r\nCorrect - if the mempool clears out almost every night then there is no need for this.\r\n\r\n> Would a child transaction prevent this from running or would it run regardless? Or is there some other mechanism by which a recipient could disable this functionality?\r\n\r\nWith the code in this PR, no. Descendants are ignored when considering whether a transaction is eligible for replacement.\r\n\r\n> Can somebody describe a specific scenario where a user would benefit from this change in network policy? Is this a user that uses an RBF wallet, but chooses to have RBF disabled but then changes his mind?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are wallets that *can* create replacement transactions but don't signal RBF by default (I believe this is the case with Bitcoin Core and Electrum wallet). If a user of one of those wallets sends a transaction using the defaults, finds that it's stuck and later wishes to bump the fee, they are unable to. If the defaults for policy were changed according to this PR, that user would be able to bump their transaction after 6 hours (or 72 hours if we changed the default time).\r\n\r\nMy main argument for this change is that it makes expectations clearer. As @greenaddress, @petertodd and @gmaxwell have pointed out, if a transaction is unconfirmed after 6 hours, a malicious actor could easily have double-spent it. Any recipient of a transaction that hasn't been confirmed after that much time should therefore not have any confidence that the tx will ever confirm.",

      "body": "> Can somebody describe a specific scenario where a user would benefit from this change in network policy?\r\n\r\nNear the end of 2017, \"how much time do I need to wait until my transaction gets cancelled\" was a frequent question on IRC. The usual scenario was that the user had used either old software, or just a shitty wallet, that did not set RBF, and had set a low fee. This tx would then never get mined. In some unlucky cases, there was not even a change output, so CPFP could not be used.\r\n\r\nNot sure how much wallets improved since then. I guess we will only really know when the mempool gets consistently non-empty again.\r\n\r\nThis PR, being able to RBF transactions without opt-in after some time, would be useful so that at least users could be given a precise answer to the original question: \"after x hours, the tx can be changed\". Then again, I am skeptical about light wallets implementing this... they would need to keep track of the time they broadcast the tx, assume default node behaviour, and only after timeout, offer an option to bump the fee...? Well I guess the option could always be there, along with some disclaimer (I think this is what we might do in Electrum).\r\n\r\nI am in favour of this, hugely because I consider it valuable to have a precise answer (even if it only reflects default behaviour).\r\nI guess @jnewbery meant something else (0-conf being unsecure) when saying \"My main argument for this change is that it makes expectations clearer\"; still, I feel the same.\r\n\r\n> Currently, there are wallets that can create replacement transactions but don't signal RBF by default (I believe this is the case with Bitcoin Core and Electrum wallet).\r\n\r\nIn Electrum, on desktop, all transactions are RBF by default since 3.1 (March 2018);\r\nand low fee transactions have RBF enabled by default since 2.8 (March 2017),\r\nwhere low fee was defined as `feerate < (estimatefee(10)+estimatefee(25))/2`\r\nThe Android app still prompts the user on every tx whether to make it RBF or not. This is mainly because there are still apps out there that do not display incoming RBF transactions at all until they confirm, which is a horrible experience at a PoS.",

      "body": "@jnewbery \r\n> Currently, there are wallets that can create replacement transactions but don't signal RBF by default (I believe this is the case with Bitcoin Core and Electrum wallet). If a user of one of those wallets sends a transaction using the defaults, finds that it's stuck and later wishes to bump the fee, they are unable to. \r\n\r\nRight. So we could estimate the usage of these two wallets (Electrum and Bitcoin Core GUI) to what, 10% of payments in a day [link](https://dashboard.bitcoinops.org/d/ZsCio4Dmz/rbf-signalling?orgId=1), generously?  And this error case is a single digit percentage of that, and something that the wallet could prevent. On the other side of the scale we have the 50%+ of payments that are being sent from custodial services or exchanges [link](https://p2sh.info/dashboard/db/batching?orgId=1). Or the 60% of payments that use something that doesn't even do Segwit yet [link](https://transactionfee.info/charts/payments/segwit). These users will not helped by this, in fact the bitcoin network for them becomes strictly worse. I will elaborate further down.\r\n\r\n> My main argument for this change is that it makes expectations clearer.\r\n\r\nSo, Signalpolitik. If that'st he goal then that should be discussed not in a github ticket or IRC but in more broad social angles. \r\n\r\n> if a transaction is unconfirmed after 6 hours, a malicious actor could easily have double-spent it. Any recipient of a transaction that hasn't been confirmed after that much time should therefore not have any confidence that the tx will ever confirm.\r\n\r\nIf this were really the case then we wouldn't need this PR, would we? But regardless, this is an assumption that is easily testable. Let's do some tests before we roll out such a big policy change? To my knowledge most tests that are referenced happened in 2012, would be good to have some new data. Happy to let you use Bitrefill to test against, you can buy Lightning channels and just not redeem them and have my word that there will be no trouble. Our findings is that it's reasonably secure for smaller transactions and empirically there hasn't been any systematic abuse of this feature (we've had plenty of attempts to abuse other things)\r\n\r\n@SomberNight \r\n> which is a horrible experience at a PoS\r\n\r\nEarnestly glad that you also value the benefit of still having PoS payments with onchain bitcoin. Not sure what thoughts on this are among the maintainers of this repo. While I too think that all such payments will migrate to Lightning with some time, there is no need to break current onchain policy, Lightning is attractive enough to get people to upgrade without the stick. \r\n\r\nBy PoS here I mean the classic \"scan qr code to send X BTC to Y address\" mode that i think we all recognize. \r\n<img width=\"555\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-05-09 at 15 09 29\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92292/57455902-85e62e00-726c-11e9-8551-8da31a26d1a6.png\">\r\n\r\nRBF breaks this model for any purchase that is denominated in USD as it allows the user to game the system by waiting indefinitely to see if the Bitcoin prices move. If Bitcoin price goes up while transaction is still unconfirmed - simply cancel it and make a new one for cheaper. If the merchant decides to change the offered price while the payment is in the mempool that opens up for a world of hurt that none of us want.\r\n\r\nWith RBF this exposure grows beyond the 15 minutes or so that the merchant decides, but it expands to the entire period until the transaction confirms, which in this case can be a very long time (hence the reason for this ticket). This isn't a huge deal when individual wallets have this behavior because you can inform the user about it and have them either disable that feature for next time, or even change wallets to one that will have a better experience. Currently RBF usage is around 7% of transactions [link](https://dashboard.bitcoinops.org/d/ZsCio4Dmz/rbf-signalling?orgId=1), probably lower of batched payments, so not a huge deal. But if we break the behavior on a _policy level_ it means that services that have a PoS display like the above will need to move to a custodial model (deposit and confirm first, buy stuff later, keep some change on the account). One might make an argument that this mode is better and this is how bitcoin should be working and so on, but that's a bigger discussion than reviewing code in a PR. My experience with bitcoin core is that there is a desire to maintain backwards compatibility as much as possible and not introduce contentious changes.",

      "body": "> So, Signalpolitik. If that'st he goal then that should be discussed not in a github ticket or IRC but in more broad social angles.\r\n\r\nThat's not really what I meant. After 6/72/whatever hours, if my node receives a transaction that replaces a tx in my mempool, but with a larger fee, then I can be reasonably sure that the creator of that transaction could get it confirmed ahead of the original transaction. My mempool pretending that's not the case and rejecting the replacement is not helpful to me.\r\n\r\nI agree though, this does deserve wider discussion and a github issue isn't really the place for it (and I thank you for taking part in the discussion here!)\r\n\r\n> Let's do some tests before we roll out such a big policy change? Happy to let you use bitrefill to test against, can buy Lightning channels and just not redeem them.\r\n\r\nThat sounds fun! It'll be more difficult to double-spend you while blocks aren't consistently full. As you've observed above, this change makes sense in a world where blocks *are* consistently full. The reason to make this change now is that node policy should be changed in advance of expected changes in the network (see #15846 for example).\r\n\r\nThanks again for your robust input in this PR. It really is very useful to hear from merchants and high-frequency users.",
