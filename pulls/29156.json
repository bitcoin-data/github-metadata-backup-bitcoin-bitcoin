    "body": "This is very closely based on [test/functional/wallet_multisig_descriptor_psbt.py](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/wallet_multisig_descriptor_psbt.py) both in code and concept. It should serve as some integration testing for Miniscript descriptors, and also documents a simple multisig that starts as 4-of-4 and decays to 3-of-4, 2-of-4, and finally 1-of-4 at block heights (I think in the real world aligning this to halvenings would be nice).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

In a similar spirit I improved #29154 (also adding a 2nd commit with your suggestion, and in that case we can also assert that order of xpubs in the multisig descriptors don't matter since it is `sorted`).\r\n\r\n> Also, one thing I am unsure of is if we should include this test in test/functional/wallet_multisig_descriptor_psbt.py since they are very similar and maybe we can use common functions but I am not sure what will be the cleanest\r\n\r\nI don't think it would be too much trouble to combine them, but I didn't go that route because my opinion is that some code duplication is preferable to trying to generalize/combine these tests. So I went the route of keeping these as two simple independent integration tests. I don't have a strong opinion on this, but usually for test code like this I lean towards approach I took where I duplicate some code to favor simple and easy to explain/delete tests. If more people feel strongly one way or the other I'm happy to change though",

      "body": "Thank you @michaelfolkson and @Eunovo for the reviews! I agree with both of your feedback re improving `descriptors.md` docs to accompany this test. I will have a commit addressing your feedback in the coming days.\r\n\r\n> I think it is probably overkill to create a new functional test file for this. I'm not sure why it can't go in wallet_miniscript.py\r\n\r\nMy intention with this test is to provide a \"reference example\" with the same motivations and flow/architecture as #22067 (and the original issue #21278 it resolved). But taking this one step further with a \"decaying\" multisig that highlights \"Miniscript as an extension of descriptors\" and showing the same multisig architecture and signing flows \"just work\" when we utilize Miniscript.\r\n\r\nTo your point - the additional raw test coverage this provides is limited, and if anything could be accomplished in `wallet_miniscript.py`. So if a \"reference example\" that tests end-to-end functionality of a wallet like this at a high-level (and more from a user perspective) isn't valuable then this is overkill and is not needed.\r\n\r\nI think once I follow up with docs this intention will be clear. Then we can see if this additional test is useful or overkill.\r\n\r\n> modify(ing) the external wallet's timelocks\r\n\r\n@Eunovo interesting observation! We could also break up the initial deposit into multiple utxos so that we aren't only spending change after the first transaction. I played around with it locally after thinking through your writeup, but I'm leaning towards not modifying the test to try to assert this failure. Partly because modifying the external descriptor to differ from internal would be a _different wallet_ conceptually than what I have here. Ideally #22838 would be merged and I'd be using those semantics in this test and then it's even more clear that external and internal wallets should only differ in derivation path\r\n\r\nRegardless, it's cool you thought of this. For a similar wallet that uses relative time locks instead of absolute, this would be even weirder. Because the same concept could lead to the change of a spendable utxo being unspendable for a time.",
