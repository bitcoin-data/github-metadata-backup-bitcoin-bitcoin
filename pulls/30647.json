    "body": "In 6bfa26048dbafb91e9ca63ea8d3960271e798098 the testnet4 timewarp attack fix block time variation was increased from the Great Consensus Cleanup value of 600s to 7200s on the thesis that this allows miners to always create blocks with the current time. Sadly, doing so does allow for some nonzero inflation, even if not a huge amount.\r\n\r\nWhile it could be that some hardware ignores the timestamp provided to it over Stratum and forces the block header timestamp to the current time, I'm not aware of any such hardware, and it would also likely suffer from random invalid blocks due to relying on NTP anyway, making its existence highly unlikely.\r\n\r\nThis leaves the only concern being pools, but most of those rely on work generated by Bitcoin Core (in one way or another, though when spy mining possibly not), and it seems likely that they will also not suffer any lost work. While its possible that a pool does generate invalid work due to spy mining or otherwise custom logic, it seems unlikely that a substantial portion of hashrate would do so, making the difference somewhat academic (any pool that screws this up will only do so once and the network would come out just fine).\r\n\r\nFurther, while we may end up deciding these assumptions were invalid and we should instead use 7200s, it seems prudent to try with the value we \"want\" on testnet4, giving us the ability to learn if the compatibility concerns are an issue before we go to mainnet.",

      "message": "Move maximum timewarp attack threshold back to 600s from 7200s\n\nIn 6bfa26048dbafb91e9ca63ea8d3960271e798098 the testnet4 timewarp\nattack fix block time variation was increased from the Great\nConsensus Cleanup value of 600s to 7200s on the thesis that this\nallows miners to always create blocks with the current time. Sadly,\ndoing so does allow for some nonzero inflation, even if not a huge\namount.\n\nWhile it could be that some hardware ignores the timestamp provided\nto it over Stratum and forces the block header timestamp to the\ncurrent time, I'm not aware of any such hardware, and it would also\nlikely suffer from random invalid blocks due to relying on NTP\nanyway, making its existence highly unlikely.\n\nThis leaves the only concern being pools, but most of those rely on\nwork generated by Bitcoin Core (in one way or another, though when\nspy mining possibly not), and it seems likely that they will also\nnot suffer any lost work. While its possible that a pool does\ngenerate invalid work due to spy mining or otherwise custom logic,\nit seems unlikely that a substantial portion of hashrate would do\nso, making the difference somewhat academic (any pool that screws\nthis up will only do so once and the network would come out just\nfine).\n\nFurther, while we may end up deciding these assumptions were\ninvalid and we should instead use 7200s, it seems prudent to try\nwith the value we \"want\" on testnet4, giving us the ability to\nlearn if the compatibility concerns are an issue before we go to\nmainnet.",
