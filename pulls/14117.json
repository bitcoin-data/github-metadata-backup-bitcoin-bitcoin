      "body": "@fanquake I do quite a lot of checking using various automated jobs, this includes: custom linting, running static analysers on the code base, running tests under dynamic analysers, spell checking of documentation, compiling under various compilers with a wide range of warning flags enabled, etc, etc. These jobs currently run only against `master` due to resource limitations.\r\n\r\nIdeally these checks would run in Travis (assuming the false positive rate is near zero and the runtime is low): that would make sure these issues don't reach `master`, solve the resource limitations and keep the entire process automated. Could it be better? :-)\r\n\r\nIn order to catch a larger proportion of these issues pre-merge please help reaching that goal by taking a few minutes to review some of these open PRs of mine:\r\n* To allow for automated thread safety checking (`-Wthread-safety-analysis`) under Travis: please help by reviewing #11634, #11652, #13115, #13123, #13128, #14108 and the tracking issue #13129\r\n* To allow for automated detection of accidentally ignored return values (`[[nodiscard]]`) under Travis: please help by reviewing #13864 and #13815\r\n* To allow for automated integer overflow/wraparound checking (`-fsanitize=integer`) under Travis: please help by reviewing #11535 and #11551\r\n* To allow for automated spell checking (`codespell`) under Travis: please help by reviewing #13954\r\n* To allow for automated checking of Doxygen comments (`-Wdocumentation`) under Travis: please help by reviewing #13914\r\n* To allow for automated detection of general issues – please help increase signal to noise by fixing/avoiding compiler warnings or static analyzer warnings (by fixing the cause of the warning at hand or by simply guiding the static analyzers better): please help by reviewing #14117 (this PR), #14094, #14088, #13969, #13909, #13897, #13548, #13766, #13546, #13392, #13382 and #13249.\r\n* To improve the linting/fuzzing/testing infrastructure in general: please help by reviewing #14092, #14010 and #14115\r\n\r\nThanks for helping out!\r\n\r\nThe C++ Core Guidelines sum up my view on the benefits of mechanical checking over human reviewing for this subclass of issues:\r\n\r\n> Enforcement might be done by code review, by static analysis, by compiler, or by run-time checks. Wherever possible, we prefer “mechanical” checking (humans are slow, inaccurate, and bore easily) and static checking.",
