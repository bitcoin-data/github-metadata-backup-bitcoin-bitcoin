    "body": "Have depends make libmultiprocess by default. This PR causes the following behavior changes:\r\n\r\n1. **bitcoin-node and bitcoin-gui binaries are included in releases**, due to `ENABLE_IPC` option being switched on by default in depends builds\r\n2. `ENABLE_IPC` is also switched on by default in non-depends builds\r\n3. Various changes to CI: switching on `ENABLE_IPC` on in most configurations and using `bitcoin-node` binary (`bitcoin -m`) for functional tests in two of them.\r\n4. The `bitcoin-node` and `bitcoin-gui` are added to `Maintenance.cmake` (since they're now in the release)\r\n5. macOS and Linux installation instructions are updated to install `capnp` by default\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't need to do all of 3 things at once. However it's is simpler, avoids code churn (especially in CI), and  probably less confusing to make all these changes in the same PR.\r\n\r\nWindows is not supported yet, so `ENABLE_IPC` is off by default for it. It can be enabled after https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32387.\r\n\r\nThe initial main use case for IPC is to enable experimental support for the Mining IPC interface. A working example of a Stratum v2 Template Provider client using this interface can be found here: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48. \r\n\r\nSee #31756 for discussion of when this should happen. Supersedes #30975.\r\n\r\nGuix hashes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n```",

Given recent momentum i estimate it's possible we might release multiprocess in \r\n                     30.0, which means if we want to deprecate the bitcoin-wallet utility name we should do it.. now?\r\n17:33:31 < sipa> bitcoin-wallet-util ?\r\n...\r\n23:38:57 < _aj_> darosior: bitcoin-wallet-process, bitcoin-gui-process, etc? it's multi *-process!\r\n03:04:34 < Sjors[m]> darosior: at the moment there is no wallet binary if were to enable multiprocess. That won't happen until #19460.\r\n...\r\n03:05:18 < Sjors[m]> Or maybe already in #10102\r\n...\r\n03:05:50 < Sjors[m]> In any case #31802 only adds bitcoin-node and bitcoin-gui.\r\n...\r\n03:07:19 < Sjors[m]> Though if we want to rename the utility eventually, it's always better to do it early.\r\n```",

There are some other depends/cmake options that seem to share the same names like `NO_WALLET`/`ENABLE_WALLET`, `NO_ZMQ`/`WITH_ZMQ`, `NO_USDT`/`WITH_USDT`, etc\r\n",

I think it might be good for PR to clearly mention the 3 changes in behavior it causes:\r\n\r\n1 - Causes `bitcoin-node` and `bitcoin-gui` binaries to be included in releases and `ENABLE_IPC` option to be switched on by default in depends builds.\r\n2 - Also causes `ENABLE_IPC` option to be switched on by default in both non-depends builds\r\n3 - Makes various changes to CI: switching on ENABLE_IPC on in most configurations and using `bitcoin-node` binary for functional tests in two of them.\r\n\r\nIt would also be good to point out that that this PR doesn't **need** to do all of 3 things at once. It is simpler and probably less confusing to make all these changes in the same PR, but if we want to isolate any of these things and make them separate, that's possible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802#issuecomment-2798079537\r\n\r\nAll the choices you made about CI jobs options seem reasonable, and seem to test everything we would want. But @maflcko has best understanding of CI jobs and might have input.",

There should be no impact in user experience, because thanks to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31375 the recommended invocation `bitcoin -m` will find `bitcoin-node` whether it's in `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/local/libexec`. But an upgrade would leave a stale version of `bitcoin-node` in `bin`, so it's nicer to get that PR _in the same release_ as this one. Merge order shouldn't matter.",

The proposed solution of falling back to the poll()-implementation seems simple enough though, will take a deeper look next week. (Fwiw, I reached out to the author asking if they are still working on this just in case, though the chance after more than a year is close to zero.)",

Also, I think even with EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS disabled, errors similar to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802#issuecomment-2858241771 could still happen because that error comes from a header file included via `-I`, not `-isystem`",

Would maybe say \"`NO_IPC`: don't build Cap’n Proto and libmultiprocess packages, and disable building IPC binaries (`bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-gui`)\"\r\n\r\nAlso, since this is the most significant commit in the PR, which controls whether IPC binaries are included in releases, it would be good to mention the effect this has on releases in the commit description.\r\n\r\nCommit description could also mention effect this has on CI builds: it cause more depends builds to build IPC binaries, but still the only build running functional tests with them is the `i686_multiprocess` one.",
