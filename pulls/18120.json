    "body": "Refactors UpdateForDescendants to use Epochs instead of sets to de-duplicate traversal, and replaces the cache entries with a vector instead of a set. This is a straightforward win. The algorithm is a bit clever so as not to require two separate vectors for txiters that need expanding and txiters that have already been processed, but I think it's relatively easy to reason about.\r\n\r\nextracted from #18063 as a standalone because it turns out the DoS issues with this code perhaps merit more extensive review http://gnusha.org/bitcoin-core-dev/2020-02-11.log. That PR will stay open for review, but this PR is designed as an \"obviously better\" win that can be merged now to keep progress up on the mempool project.",

      "body": "ACK, this looks correct to me. \r\n\r\nI tried to benchmark some sort of \"worst-case\" scenario, where all of a block's transactions have all of the mempool as descendants, making the number of in-mempool transactions and number of in-block transactions as large as possible.  I came up with a scenario of a block that has 250 transactions and a mempool of 77,500 transactions, and measured how long UpdateTransactionsFromBlock takes on my machine after disconnecting that block.  In the 0.19 branch, this took about 54 seconds.  In master, this takes about 48 seconds, and after this commit it takes about 25 seconds.\r\n\r\n(25 seconds is still terrible, of course, and we should continue to find ways to make structural improvements so that we don't have long delays in the critical path of block acceptance, but this change makes sense to me as a significant algorithmic improvement.)",
