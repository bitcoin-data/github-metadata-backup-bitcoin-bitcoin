    "body": "This modifies `DecodeBase58` and `EncodeBase58` by processing multiple input bytes at once. For `DecodeBase58` we can take 9 bytes at once, and for `EncodeBase58` 7. This reduces the number of calls of the inner conversion loop.\r\n\r\nBenchmark results:\r\n\r\n* 37.78 -> 13.73 ns/byte for `Base58Decode`, ~2.8 times faster.\r\n* 28.81 -> 7.02 ns/byte for `EncodeBase58`, ~4.1 times faster.\r\n\r\nNote that I tried to improve `blockToJSON` with this change, but the difference there is not really significant. This optimization might still be relevant though for e.g. `listunspents`, see #7656\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

      "message": "Improve speed of Base58 Encoding\n\nThis modifies `DecodeBase58` and `EncodeBase58` by processing multiple input bytes at once. For `DecodeBase58` we can take 9 bytes at once,\nand for `EncodeBase58` 7. This reduces the number of calls of the inner conversion loop.\n\nBenchmark results:\n\n* 37.78 -> 13.73 ns/byte for `Base58Decode`, ~2.8 times faster.\n* 28.81 -> 7.02 ns/byte for `EncodeBase58`, ~4.1 times faster.\n\nNote that I tried to improve `blockToJSON` with this change, but the difference there is not really significant. This optimization might still be\nrelevant though for e.g. `listunspents`, see #7656",

I'm not really declining this, my point was only that \"reviewable straightforward code\" is important from a security perspective and this sometimes trumps pure performance (depending on the part of the code). Especially in a memory-unsafe language like C++ where it's so easy to reach outside a buffer. We've had some discussions about this in the past when Base58 seemed to attract a lot of pretty arbitrary \"make it faster\" changes. At least you're doing proper benchmarking.",
