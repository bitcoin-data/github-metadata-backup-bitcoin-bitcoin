    "body": "Add `-ipcbind` option to `bitcoin-node` to make it listen on a unix socket and accept connections from other processes. The default socket path is `<datadir>/node.sock`, but this can be customized.\r\n\r\nThis option lets potential wallet, gui, index, and mining processes connect to the node and control it. See examples in #19460, #19461, and #30437.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this PR, in combination with #30510, is be able to release a bitcoin core node binary that can generate block templates for a separate Stratum v2 mining service, like the one being implemented in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48, that connects over IPC.\r\n\r\nOther things to know about this PR:\r\n\r\n- While the `-ipcbind` option lets other processes to connect to the `bitcoin-node` process, the only thing they can actually do after connecting is call methods on the [`Init`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/ipc/capnp/init.capnp#L17-L20) interface which is currently very limited and doesn't do much. But PRs [#30510](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30510), [#29409](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29409), and [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) expand the `Init` interface to expose mining, wallet, and gui functionality respectively.\r\n\r\n- This PR is not needed for [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102), which runs GUI, node, and wallet code in different processes, because [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) does not use unix sockets or allow outside processes to connect to existing processes. [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) lets parent and child processes communicate over internal socketpairs, not externally accessible sockets.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).",

The maximum unix socket path length is only 107 characters, so I thought a shorter suffix might avoid problems on systems with long data directory or home directory paths.\r\n\r\nAnother possible approach could be to use `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bitcoin-node.sock` as the default socket path, since `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` should resolve to a short path like `/run/user/1000`. But this could lead to surprises on systems with multiple data directories since the socket path is no longer inside the data directory, and it could cause security problems since the socket would no longer be shielded by permissions of the data directory.\r\n\r\nUpdated 3d9a8cb4e194399fa9b2ce8af6bd2a8b8ef970c6 -> efdc120795e7c3ce914ee0677c3b69803ea5de1e ([`pr/ipc-bind.1`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc-bind.1) -> [`pr/ipc-bind.2`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/ipc-bind.2), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/ipc-bind.1..pr/ipc-bind.2)) with this change and a test simplification.",

      "body": "The test failure https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5102088831631360 in the new test which tests binding and connecting on [multiple sockets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30509#discussion_r1707288885) turns out to reveal a corner case bug in libmultiprocess. The bug does not happen locally for me, but it does happen if I run the CI scripts inside a container, I think maybe because the container is 32 bit.\r\n\r\nBasically what happens is the test disconnects and reconnects immediately, which causes an `mp::Connection` instance to be freed and a new one to be allocated right away. In the CI container, the new mp::Connection object is allocated at the same address as the previous object and this causes the client connection try to reuse a remote thread associated with the previous connection which no longer exists. This happens because the client tracks threads to run on in a [map](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/a9e16da55e880e5a0aed5008307ea56edc33fbd1/include/mp/proxy-io.h#L529) `std::map<Connection*, ProxyClient<Thread>> request_threads;` which is keyed by Connection pointer, with the assumption that that two different connections will not have the same pointer. Which is not the case when this test case is run in the CI container. I started implementing a fix for this which cleans up the map entry when the connection is destroyed, which is probably a good thing to do anyway so the map does not have stale entries in it.",

      "body": "> `<datadir>/node.sock` seems fine, although on macOS with the longest permitted username you would go over the limit: `/Users/willem-alexanderclausgeorgeferdinand-koning-der-nederlanden-jonkheer-van-amsberg-67/Library/Application\\ Support/Bitcoin/testnet4/bitcoin-node.sock`\r\n\r\nHa! It is pretty easy to go over the socket path limit on linux too since it is only something like 100 characters. I think it might actually be possible to work around this by forking the process, changing the working directory, opening the socket with a relative path, and then passing back a file descriptor the parent process, but not sure about that and hopefully it would not be necessary.",

But #30437 would be an easier place to add this because it adds an executable that can connect.\r\n\r\n",

In which scenario should the gui be able to listen as well? Do we need a bi-directional connection here for some callbacks?\r\n\r\nAdded comment. You are right that gui does not listen on a socket, but `bitcoin-gui` accepts all the same arguments `bitcoin-node` does and more. If `bitcoin-gui` is started and a node processs is not already running (see #19461), a node process started with the provided arguments, and that node process can listen on one more more unix sockets.",

The error should be handled cleanly now instead of crashing. The connect and listen code was trying to make it easier to distinguish between different types of errors like connections that failed because nothing was listening vs connections that failed for other reasons, but the approach didn't really make sense. Error handling should be simpler and more reliable now.",
