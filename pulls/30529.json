    "body": "The PR changes behavior of negated `-noseednode`, `-nobind`, `-nowhitebind`, `-norpcbind`, `-norpcallowip`, `-norpcwhitelist`, `-notest`, `-noasmap`, `-norpcwallet`, `-noonlynet`, and `-noexternalip` options, so negating these options just clears previously specified values doesn't have other side effects.\r\n\r\nNegating options on the command line can be a useful way of resetting options that may have been set earlier in the command line or config file. But before this change, negating these options wouldn't fully reset them, and would have confusing and undocumented side effects (see commit descriptions for details). Now, negating these options just resets them and behaves the same as not specifying them.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this PR is to fix confusing behaviors and also to remove incorrect usages of the `IsArgSet()` function. Using `IsArgSet()` tends to lead to negated option bugs in general, but it especially causes bugs when used with list settings returned by `GetArgs()`, because when these settings are negated, `IsArgSet()` will return true but `GetArgs()` will return an empty list. This PR eliminates all uses of `IsArgSet()` and `GetArgs()` together, and followup PR #17783 makes it an error to use `IsArgSet()` on list settings, since calling `IsArgSet()` is never actually necessary. Most of the changes here were originally made in #17783 and then moved here to be easier to review and avoid a dependency on #16545.",

      "body": "> > Make negating options the same as not setting them ... -noconnect\r\n> \r\n> Maybe I am misunderstanding, but if you are trying to say that this treats `-noconnect` as if it never was set at all, then I tend to NACK\r\n\r\nNice catch! Definitely agree it would be a mistake to change `-noconnect` behavior, so I'll revert those changes and add comments to code to clarify the intent. Will also look into why `feature_config_args.py` test didn't catch this since it is testing `-noconnect` explicitly.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30529#pullrequestreview-2201953036\r\n\r\n> but why is changing `IsArgSet()` behavior not an option, instead of telling people not to use it anymore? Are there many spots that rely on it returning `true` in connection with a negated arg?\r\n\r\nI don't think there is something wrong with `IsArgSet()` behavior. The function is doing what you'd expect it to do, but the it's just not a very useful function to call in most cases compared to alternatives. I think we could actually eliminate it pretty easily but did not want to expand the scope of this PR.",

There are definitely more places where behavior could be improved. This PR was specifically trying to cover all the cases where `IsArgSet` and `GetArgs` were being used together with goal of simplifying #17783 and doesn't look at most cases beyond that.",

I added a new commit to this PR to fix `-noasmap` behavior, and listed other ideas for improving these options below.\r\n\r\n- Currently `-noasmap` fails with error \"fread failed: iostream error\" because it tries to open an empty file path. I added a new commit to fix this and make `-noasmap` just not load a file. (Separately I think there are other problems with the `-asmap` option implemention. The `-asmap` option is documented have a default value of `ip_asn.map` but this is not accurate, because no asmap file is actually loaded by default, and if an `ip_asn.map` file happens to exist it is just ignored. In order to cause an ASN map to be loaded you have to explicitly pass `-asmap`. I don't think it makes sense to have a default asmap path if it will not actually be loaded by default. Better behavior would be to treat `ip_asn.map` like `bitcoin.conf` and just load it by default as long as it exists and another path is not specified.)\r\n\r\n- Currently `-norpcport` is treated like `-rpcport=0` and always results in \"Invalid port specified in -rpcport: '0'\" errors (whether or not it is specified in combination with `-rpcbind`). I think more ideally, `-norpcport` would not be an error, it would just be accept and stop the RPC server binding to a port. Additionally, I don't think current behavior of `-norpcbind` causing the RPC server to bind to localhost makes sense. Based on behavior of `-noconnect` and the meaning of the word \"no\" I would expect `-norpcbind` to cause RPC server not to bind to an address. Better behavior would be easier to implement in a clean way with #31260 so settings could be given explicit types. It would make sense for the `-rpcport` setting to have type `std::optional<uint16_t>` and for the `-rpcbind` setting to have type `std::optional<std::vector<std::string>>`, and then the following code could be implemented\r\n  ```c++\r\n  // -rpcport is a more concise but less flexible alternative to -rpcbind, and\r\n  // -rpcbind takes precedence if the options conflict. Negation is allowed, with\r\n  // -norpcbind or -norpcport causing the RPC server not to bind to an address.\r\n  const auto rpc_port = settings::RpcPort::Get(args);\r\n  const auto rpc_bind = settings::RpcBind::Get(args);\r\n  const uint16_t default_rpc_port = rpc_port && *rpc_port ? *rpc_port : base_params.RPCPort();\r\n  std::vector<std::pair<std::string, uint16_t>> endpoints;\r\n  if (rpc_bind) {\r\n     for(const auto std::string& addr : *rpc_bind) {\r\n        endpoints.emplace_back(SplitHostPort(addr, default_rpc_port));\r\n     }\r\n  } else if (rpc_port != 0) {\r\n      endpoints.emplace_back(\"::1\", default_rpc_port);\r\n      endpoints.emplace_back(\"127.0.0.1\", default_rpc_port);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Currently `-noport` is just treated as `-port=0` and always results in \"Invalid port specified in -port: '0'\". Also currently `-nobind` binds to \"0.0.0.0\" instead of not binding to an address. IMO it would make more sense for `-noport` or `-nobind` to disable binding, in the same way suggested for `-rpcport` and `-rpcbind above.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30529#pullrequestreview-2505673099\r\n\r\n> It strikes me that maybe someone found the old behavior of disabling all networks though negating this arg useful.\r\n\r\nI think if someone wanted to not connect to any network they would use `-noconnect` instead of `-noonlynet`. I'm not sure how someone would actually discover that `-noonlynet` disables network connections, since I'd think a more logical expectation would be that `-onlynet` disables networks so `-noonlynet` re-enables them.",

But ArgsManager code goes out of its way to treat double negated settings the same as setting 1, so you generally do not need to think about this case when you are looking at code calling ArgsManager methods. If the code is doing the right thing for single negated and non-negated cases, it will probably be doing something sensible for the double negated case, too.\r\n\r\nThe more common case that does currently require thought to get right is the single negation case `-noconnect=1` `-nobind=1` `-norpcwhitelist=1` etc, where the `IsArgSet` method is a real source of confusion and bugs. Of the 15 `IsArgSet` calls removed in this PR, 12 of the calls were buggy, 2 of the calls were not buggy but unnecessary, and one call (this one) was correct but inexplicit and unclear.\r\n\r\nThe code `!args.GetArgs(\"-connect\").empty() || args.IsArgNegated(\"-connect\")` is supposed to disable DNS seeds and listening when explicit connections are specified or when connections are disabled. I think it's clearer to list those two cases separately instead of relying on knowledge that `IsArgSet` returns true in both cases, mostly because of all the other evidence that the `IsArgSet` method is misunderstood and not used correctly.\r\n\r\nThat said, I would not have a problem reverting this line and line 1923 below if reviewers think calling `IsArgSet` these two places is actually clearer.\r\n\r\n> or is something else meant by preferring `GetArgs()/IsArgNegated()` in most cases (but not all) over `IsArgSet`.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be consistently removing `IsArgSet` calls for all list settings. It is not removing other IsArgSet calls because the scope of the PR is limited, but I don't think there are any cases where IsArgSet should be preferred at this point. I think it is basically a footgun.",

I'm also not sure \"Populate outgoing connections\" more helpfully describes the assignment than \"Assign addresses of trusted nodes\", but happy to add this if you can explain a little why that's better the other comment.\r\n\r\nIn this code m_specified_outgoing will usually be assigned here if the argument is negated, depending on what follows the negated argument. The if statement here is just checking for a different case where `-connect=0` is specified and it is the last and only argument.\r\n\r\nI think the behavior here is slightly broken because if -connect=0 is followed by more -connect options the 0 address will be added. Also, the 0 address can be a valid address (synonym for localhost in linux), so maybe it should always be added. In any case it seems not great to add 0 address in some cases but not others. Probably better to drop it consistently.\r\n\r\nBut this PR is not trying to change networking behaior so I'm just adding a few comments to clarify intent of the code and say what it is doing at a high level.",

There should be more chances to make improvements here later.\r\n\r\nThe comment was saying why the dnsseed is ignored: because automatic connections are disabled. The log message says the seed is ignored because -connect is specified, but it is not obvious (IMO) that specifying -connect disables other connections. \r\n\r\nThe -proxy part of this check seems buggy to me and I mentioned that in the commit message, but didn't look into the history, and in any case don't want to change the behavior in this PR.",

IMO, it would be good to clean up the failing tests and maybe add a warning that some failures might not be detected if optimizations are turned on.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, I think there are common conventions for using `assert` statements that make code easier to read and intent easier to see, namely that:\r\n\r\n- `assert` statements can be removed without changing the meaning of the code\r\n- if an `assert` statement fails, it means an internal assumption is wrong, not that an external failure has occurred\r\n\r\nThese are conventions I like to follow and benefit from when they are followed other places. I wouldn't insist that anybody else needs to follow these conventions, but I wouldn't write code breaking them myself, just like I wouldn't write code calling string variables `i` and int variables `s`, because there's a common and useful convention that does the opposite of this and I don't want to break.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I assumed the other tests were also checking for `addcon_thread_started` to fail quickly instead of timing out if expected messages did not show up.  But actually the other tests are using `addcon_thread_started`, because they are checking for absence not presence of other log messages, so they don't have any other alternative except checking for the later log message.\r\n\r\nI still think waiting for a message that you know will show up and then checking for other conditions can be a good approach to avoid test timeouts and make tests easier to run and modify, but agree now the simpler approach works better here.",
