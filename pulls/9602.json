    "body": "Please see #9601 for all non-technical discussion.\r\nIncludes #9391 as the first commit\r\nPlease tag 0.15\r\n\r\nThis PR removes all coin age priority functionality from the codebase.\r\n\r\nSome remaining open questions:\r\n- The `prioritisetransaction` RPC API is broken.  Should we instead try to implement backwards compatible support, or is it fair to break it?  Previously it required exactly 3 arguments, now it requires exactly 2, so it will not result in unintended consequences.\r\n- The 6th commit changes `sendrawtransaction` to no longer bypass minRelayTxFee by setting fLimitFree to false.  `prioritisetransaction` can always be used to achieve the same effect.  This seems an improvement in behavior, but isn't required (although the prioritise_transaction.py RPC test would need to be fixed if we don't include this).\r\n- fLimitFree is now only ~~set~~ **false** for transactions we are trying to reaccept to the mempool from a disconnected block.  Should it also be used to bypass the mempool min fee in the event of mempool limiting.  I think yes, but can be left for a separate PR. **(EDIT for clarification:** currently if mempool limiting is active, even if fLimitFree is set false, transactions which don't pass the mempool min fee set by the last evicted transaction will still not be accepted to the mempool.  It is probably preferable that they are accepted and then the mempool will be limited again post acceptance and either there will have been room for them, they will be evicted, or they will be part of a more expensive package and something else will be evicted.**)**\r\n-  The last commit is optional and introduces ability to set `-minrelaytxfee` to 0.  This isn't necessary, but seemed better to me especially now other ways to accept transactions without fee have been removed.\r\n\r\nFixes #9601\r\nFixes #6675\r\nFixes #2673 (thanks @MarcoFalke)",

Could you say more about how this would work, what would be the advantages / disadvantages? Also, in the comment that \"fLimitFree is now only set for transactions we are trying to reaccept to the mempool,\" assuming you meant \"set false\" not \"set\".\r\n- Re: prioritisetransaction, one risk of reducing the number of arguments is that at some point in the future, somebody adds a new argument, and then old code calling the RPC with priority may appear to work but silently be broken. You could keep the priority_delta arg and require it to be null or 0 to prevent this. But I think getting rid of the argument is nice if you don't think it's likely someone will add a new prioritisetransaction argument in the future.",
