    "body": "Please see #9601 for all non-technical discussion.\r\nIncludes #9391 as the first commit\r\nPlease tag 0.15\r\n\r\nThis PR removes all coin age priority functionality from the codebase.\r\n\r\nSome remaining open questions:\r\n- The `prioritisetransaction` RPC API is broken.  Should we instead try to implement backwards compatible support, or is it fair to break it?  Previously it required exactly 3 arguments, now it requires exactly 2, so it will not result in unintended consequences.\r\n- The 6th commit changes `sendrawtransaction` to no longer bypass minRelayTxFee by setting fLimitFree to false.  `prioritisetransaction` can always be used to achieve the same effect.  This seems an improvement in behavior, but isn't required (although the prioritise_transaction.py RPC test would need to be fixed if we don't include this).\r\n- fLimitFree is now only ~~set~~ **false** for transactions we are trying to reaccept to the mempool from a disconnected block.  Should it also be used to bypass the mempool min fee in the event of mempool limiting.  I think yes, but can be left for a separate PR. **(EDIT for clarification:** currently if mempool limiting is active, even if fLimitFree is set false, transactions which don't pass the mempool min fee set by the last evicted transaction will still not be accepted to the mempool.  It is probably preferable that they are accepted and then the mempool will be limited again post acceptance and either there will have been room for them, they will be evicted, or they will be part of a more expensive package and something else will be evicted.**)**\r\n-  The last commit is optional and introduces ability to set `-minrelaytxfee` to 0.  This isn't necessary, but seemed better to me especially now other ways to accept transactions without fee have been removed.\r\n\r\nFixes #9601\r\nFixes #6675\r\nFixes #2673 (thanks @MarcoFalke)",

Also in the event that we feel anything needs to be pre-announced with the 0.14 release this will give us a chance to think about that, although I don't think there is anything pressing.\r\n",

          "body": "Please tag 0.14.\r\n\r\nThis is built on #9589 -- the last 3 commits here are new.\r\n\r\nThe first fix is a minor one, which is to correctly calculate the maximum size of the replacement transaction, which is used to calculate the fee to put on the transaction.  The old algorithm (of adding 1 byte per input) is actually not always conservative enough, for instance in situations where you get \"lucky\" and the original transaction has very short signatures.  I managed to encounter such a transaction during testing of #9589, and it was a difficult-to-debug problem, so I thought we should fix.\r\n\r\nThe second fix is a more important bugfix, which is that if the replacement transaction failed to enter the mempool (#9589 makes this much less likely to happen, fortunately), then we'd throw an RPC error even though the new transaction has been recorded in the wallet (and not mark the original tx as having been replaced).  This is similar to the bug we fixed in #9302 -- we should always return the new txid to the user once we've generated it, as throwing an error implies the operation failed.  The approach I took was to aggregate the errors in a single JSON object and return it, similar to what we do in some other RPCs.",

Could you say more about how this would work, what would be the advantages / disadvantages? Also, in the comment that \"fLimitFree is now only set for transactions we are trying to reaccept to the mempool,\" assuming you meant \"set false\" not \"set\".\r\n- Re: prioritisetransaction, one risk of reducing the number of arguments is that at some point in the future, somebody adds a new argument, and then old code calling the RPC with priority may appear to work but silently be broken. You could keep the priority_delta arg and require it to be null or 0 to prevent this. But I think getting rid of the argument is nice if you don't think it's likely someone will add a new prioritisetransaction argument in the future.",

I'll defer to group consensus, but my viewpoint is if we never change it then we're stuck with a stupid dummy field for all eternity, and if we are ever going to change it, now is the time to do so.  I think its a pretty safe change as it'll either work the old way or the new but they can't be mixed up.\r\n",

          "body": "During a reorg, we currently try to add transactions from each disconnected block back to the mempool, even though we are likely to find many of those transactions in the blocks that get connected.\r\n\r\nThis PR stores those transactions in a separate \"disconnect pool\" for later processing. This has a few side effects:\r\n\r\n * There should be many fewer transactions to re-add to the mempool, assuming the reorg is benign and most transactions appear on both forks, which means we'll do less work.\r\n\r\n * When we do add things to the mempool, we'll do it in one attempt rather than separately for each disconnected block, so mempool chain limits will be calculated and applied differently for reorgs than before. Overall it should be much more efficient, because we will have fewer calls chasing long chains in the mempool to keep track of ancestor and descendant state (both because we will call UpdateTransactionsFromBlock on a smaller set of transactions overall, and because the descendant caching it does isn't reused across calls, so it's more efficient to call UpdateTransactionsFromBlock once for all of a reorg's transactions than multiple times).\r\n\r\n * Storing the transactions in this new disconnect pool means we use more memory during a reorg. I've added a bound on how much memory can be used, and if we would exceed it we just try to keep the oldest transactions that are disconnected (the idea being that it's more important to ensure that older transactions that are reorged out have an opportunity to be re-mined, compared with newer ones). This could probably be improved in the future, since in such a (rare) scenario, we would probably want to throw out our current mempool in favor of being able to hold more older transactions, or we might want to re-read those transactions off disk to try to pick up everything that is now unconfirmed. But for now I made the memory bound large enough that this shouldn't practically occur.\r\n",

If priority block space is being phased out, then free transactions are going to have a much harder time getting into blocks (according to what I'm observing as well), so to prevent a bunch of un-mineable txs from piling up we should discourage limitfreerelay.\n\nAlso, it makes it easier for people to double-spend their zero-fee transactions, if those transactions weren't hanging around in a bunch of mempools because of high priority, yet not being able to be confirmed.\n",

I'm a bit confused by some of the mempool storage mechanisms and was hoping someone could point me the in the right direction as far as stuff to implement.

          "body": "This PR implements CPFP transaction selection mechanism, which is the simplest \"fee bumping technique\" (we might want to consider implementing RBF too later on).\r\nThe algorithm in `CreateNewBlock` now selects transactions based on their feerate, inclusive of unconfirmed ancestor transactions.  This means that a low-fee transaction can become more likely to be selected if a high-fee transaction that spends its outputs is relayed: the fee burned in the \"child\" transaction, actually pays for the parent tx too (hence the name).\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes completely the (already deprecated) notion of coinage-based priority and \"free transactions area\".\r\n\r\nChanges backported / adapted from:\r\n\r\n- bitcoin#7600 [Suhas Daftuar]\r\n- bitcoin#8287 [MarcoFalke]\r\n- bitcoin#8295 [Suhas Daftuar]\r\n- bitcoin#9138 [Alex Morcos]\r\n- bitcoin#9602 [Alex Morcos]\r\n- bitcoin#11847 [Suhas Daftuar]",
