    "body": " Add sendall RPC née sweep\r\n\r\n_Motivation_\r\nCurrently, the wallet uses a fSubtractFeeAmount (SFFO) flag on the\r\nrecipients objects for all forms of sending calls. According to the\r\ncommit discussion, this flag was chiefly introduced to permit sweeping\r\nwithout manually calculating the fees of transactions. However, the flag\r\nleads to unintuitive behavior and makes it more complicated to test\r\nmany wallet RPCs exhaustively. We proposed to introduce a dedicated\r\n`sendall` RPC with the intention to cover this functionality.\r\n\r\nSince the proposal, it was discovered in further discussion that our\r\nproposed `sendall` rpc and SFFO have subtly different scopes of\r\noperation.\r\n• sendall:\r\n  Use _given UTXOs_ to pay a destination the remainder after fees.\r\n• SFFO:\r\n  Use a _given budget_ to pay an address the remainder after fees.\r\n\r\nWhile `sendall` will simplify cases of spending a given set of\r\nUTXOs such as paying the value from one or more specific UTXOs, emptying\r\na wallet, or burning dust, we realized that there are some cases in\r\nwhich SFFO is used to pay other parties from a limited budget,\r\nwhich can often lead to the creation of change outputs. This cannot be\r\neasily replicated using `sendall` as it would require manual\r\ncomputation of the appropriate change amount.\r\n\r\nAs such, sendall cannot replace all uses of SFFO, but it still has a\r\ndifferent use case and will aid in simplifying some wallet calls and\r\nnumerous wallet tests.\r\n\r\n_Sendall call details_\r\nThe proposed sendall call builds a transaction from a specific\r\nsubset of the wallet's UTXO pool (by default all of them) and assigns\r\nthe funds to one or more receivers. Receivers can either be specified\r\nwith a given amount or receive an equal share of the remaining\r\nunassigned funds. At least one recipient must be provided without\r\nassigned amount to collect the remainder. The `sendall` call will\r\nnever create change. The call has a `send_max` option that changes the\r\ndefault behavior of spending all UTXOs (\"no UTXO left behind\"), to\r\nmaximizing the output amount of the transaction by skipping uneconomic\r\nUTXOs. The `send_max` option is incompatible with providing a specific\r\nset of inputs.\r\n\r\n---\r\nEdit: Replaced OP with latest commit message to reflect my updated motivation of the proposal.",

This can be useful e.g. when verifying that a coin join like transaction doesn't contain unexpected inputs that the wallet will then sign for unintentionally.\r\n\r\nI originally proposed this to Elements (https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/pull/1016) and it was suggested that I propose this upstream.\r\n\r\nThere is an alternative #22776 to instead add this info to `getbalances` when providing an optional transaction as argument.",

I shall do a manual test by creating a new wallet and sweeping it in some time. Meanwhile, I have some doubts and suggestions that might help make this PR even better.\r\n",

So it is now deprecated and usage of it via the RPC will require `-deprecatedrpc=sffo`. The functionality has also been removed from the GUI. The tests have been updated to either use sweep, not use SFFO, or have `-deprecatedrpc=sffo` as necessary.\r\n\r\nThere will be a followup which removes SFFO entirely.\r\n\r\nThere is also a change to `IsDeprecatedRPCEnabled` as there were linker errors for `bitcoin-wallet` with the normal way that it is used.\r\n\r\nRequired #24118.",

I don't care about exact amount of BTC received, and am happy if it's a little less or a little more to economize on fees and avoid change.\" Obviously you shouldn't use this option if you are trying to send an exact amount to someone, but it seems like it would be generally useful whenever you are sending money to one of your own wallets, or exchange accounts, or paying for any service that can be incrementally topped up.\r\n\r\nI know one of achow101's recent PR was adding more complexity to subtract from output implementation to try to do something to help sweeping, but I don't think the original (current?) semantics inherently had to add much complexity.

Sweep can be viewed as spending all UTXOs in a given list without needing to specify the output amount.

Just looking through many of the issues about SFFO show that its primary use case is to sweep an entire wallet, and sometimes spend just a preset list of coins without having to calculate the fee manually. Both of these cases can be covered by a sweep function without needing to maintain SFFO in coin selection logic.\r\n\r\n> I know one of achow101's recent PR was adding more complexity to subtract from output implementation to try to do something to help sweeping, but I don't think the original (current?) semantics inherently had to add much complexity.

      "body": "> > but it seems like it would be generally useful whenever you are sending money to one of your own wallets, or exchange accounts, or paying for any service that can be incrementally topped up.\r\n> \r\n> Can you describe why SFFO would be used in those cases? @Xekyo and I have had discussions with many people about SFFO use cases and even though the concept of \"send no more than X\" usually comes up, no one can express why that behavior would ever actually be useful.\r\n\r\nI think, mostly, it is useful *conceptually* as a way to simplify creating transactions. It's a way of expressing the *intention* behind a transaction, and letting the implementation take care of the details, instead of being having to think about what the transaction will look like, and choose between sweep and send APIs to create it.\r\n\r\nAlso the concept here is not exactly \"spend no more than X.\" If there are two amounts associated with transaction: X is amount spent by sender, Y is amount received by receiver, then option lets you choose between fixing X and letting Y vary, or fixing Y and letting X vary. If you have 12 BTC, and want to budget exactly 1 BTC per month to spend on a service, the option let you do that. And in general, it lets you just say what your intention is instead of having to think at a lower level.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is my main practical concern:\r\n\r\n- This is duplicating existing CreateTransaction(Internal) logic instead of just calling CreateTransaction with the right options. The claim is that this will be a code simplification, but the followup PR #24142 is +588/−148 lines. And this is while REMOVING features which I think we agree are useful: providing GUI support for sweeping, and being able to select coins to sweep. The new code and tests are going to grow and become even more complex after adding these features. \r\n\r\nMy medium level practical concern:\r\n\r\n- Deprecating subtract from output in #24142 presumably is going to break existing workflows, and there doesn't seem to be a good release notes or FAQ style item saying what that the problem is with subtract from output, why its removal is justified, and how to transition to the sweep API.\r\n\r\nAnd my mini practical concern:\r\n\r\n- This sweep API might be less safe than send APIs because it doesn't force you to specify amount you are trying to send. It's easier to fat-finger by accidentally sweeping the wrong wallet (or when manual coin selection is added) sweeping the wrong coin and spending an amount larger than you intended. Maybe this is not a very big concern. If it is a concern, it could also be addresed by adding a mandatory amount argument requiring you to specify total amount of the sweep or an override value like `\"unchecked\"` or `\"yolo\"`",

I don't need _automatic_ coin selection for the use case I describe above. I do still need the feature to work for _manual_ coin selection. Having to use a separate \"sweep\" RPC for that seems a bit odd, especially when it needs to support most of the `send` kitchen sink, like using hardware wallets, specifying the fee rate, RBF, etc. And it still has to work in the GUI send screen, which touches much of the same CWallet code.",

      "body": "> > I find that SFFO makes it much harder to reason about our coin selection because we now use effective values for selection, but with SFFO, we don't actually want the effective values.\r\n> \r\n> Could you explain this more? There is a [`m_subtract_fee_outputs ? m_value : effective_value`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5b4b8f76f3ae11064d4aa3ac157558e364751fd2/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L355-L358) line but that hardly seems terrible\r\n> \r\n> EDIT: I see there is a counterpart to this in `CreateTransactionInternal` where the option is used to [set](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5b4b8f76f3ae11064d4aa3ac157558e364751fd2/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L733-L735) [tx_noinput_size](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5b4b8f76f3ae11064d4aa3ac157558e364751fd2/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L741-L743). This seems pretty straightforward as well. Is this the extent of the problem or is there more under the surface?\r\n\r\nIt makes the reasoning harder because the new coin selection code is almost entirely predicated on using effective values, particularly positive effective values. For BnB and SRD, we assume there are no negative ev inputs. For Knapsack and SRD, we assume we will make change and require a minimum change value. SFFO violates these assumptions, and that leads to bugs like #23026 (which happens to be a sweep use case).\r\n\r\n> and choose between sweep and send APIs to create it.\r\n> ...\r\n> This sweep API might be less safe than send APIs because it doesn't force you to specify amount you are trying to send. It's easier to fat-finger by accidentally sweeping the wrong wallet (or when manual coin selection is added) sweeping the wrong coin and spending an amount larger than you intended. Maybe this is not a very big concern. If it is a concern, it could also be addresed by adding a mandatory amount argument requiring you to specify total amount of the sweep or an override value like `\"unchecked\"` or `\"yolo\"`\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion about combining this with send where there would be some option for sweeping and some interpretation of magic values, but we felt that would end up being too clunky to use correctly so it was abandoned.\r\n\r\n> This is duplicating existing CreateTransaction(Internal) logic instead of just calling CreateTransaction with the right options. The claim is that this will be a code simplification, but the followup PR [Deprecate SubtractFeeFromOutputs #24142](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24142) is +588/−148 lines. \r\n\r\nThe followup only has more additions because it is adding `-deprecatedrpc=sffo`. It does not remove the behavior yet.\r\n\r\n> And this is while REMOVING features which I think we agree are useful: providing GUI support for sweeping, and being able to select coins to sweep.\r\n\r\nThere will be GUI support in the future.\r\n\r\n> The new code and tests are going to grow and become even more complex after adding these features.\r\n\r\nThis new code is unlikely to be expanded further given it's limited scope. However I agree there could be some refactors for deduplication between sweep and CreateTransactionInternal.\r\n\r\n> Deprecating subtract from output in [Deprecate SubtractFeeFromOutputs #24142](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24142) presumably is going to break existing workflows, and there doesn't seem to be a good release notes or FAQ style item saying what that the problem is with subtract from output, why its removal is justified, and how to transition to the sweep API.\r\n\r\nThe same could be said about every other time `-deprecatedrpc` has been used. Needing docs is not a reason to block a deprecation.\r\n",

The problems and bugs occur when people use SFFO to specify the full wallet balance in order to arrive at a sweep functionality. Therefore, I do think that sweep is still useful, especially if we allow specifying an input list smaller than everything.

      "body": "I'm still a bit worried about the amount of duplicated code here, also in the RPC parameter parsing.\r\n\r\nCan you add some test coverage for external signer use? The easiest way is probably to tweak `wallet_signer.py` such that the `send` example results in exactly the same coin selection as the new `sweep` example. In that case you can just duplicate the `hww.send` line and compare `res[hex]` between the two calls.\r\n\r\nIf you end up with two separate transactions because the RPC calls can't produce identical results, then it's useful to know the mechanism that test uses: it has one wallet with private keys and a watch-only clone. A PSBT is generated on the watch-only wallet. The private key enabled wallet is then used to sign it, with the result stored in the file system. Once the test node calls `mocks/signer.py` it reads the stored signed PSBT and returns it, thus faking a hardware wallet that actually signed something. This can of course be done for two separate PSBT's with some refactoring, but having an identical PSBT to sign is easier.",

      "body": "Review hint for the first three commits: `git show --color-moved=dimmed-zebra --color-moved-ws=allow-indentation-change`\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if for a single recipient you can omit the array, like so: `sendall bc1q09...hufdl` (instead of `sendall '[\"bc1q09...hufdl\"]'`). \r\n\r\nThe first 3 commits are useful refactors regardless, just in case this PR doesn't make it (ACK on those, but still need to review the meat and potatoes commit).\r\n\r\nIn the description of 9bda5234bc41b7477b0224930177c6dfcd8cb9fc maybe replace \"given\" with \"specific\".\r\n\r\nLet's add a quick warning to the help text:\r\n\r\n> If your wallet contains many small inputs, either because it received tiny payments or as a result of accumulating change, consider using \"send_max\" to exclude those inputs that are worth less than the fees needed to spend them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThoughts that can wait for followups...\r\n\r\nName-wise `sendall` implies that you can't send specific UTXO's. We can think of a better name later, since it's marked experimental. One suggestion: `sendcoins`. That said, I doubt anyone uses the RPC to _manually_ perform coin selection. The GUI or some external tool is far easier to use for that. So that leaves the use case of emptying out the wallet, and for that the current name is very accurate.\r\n\r\nWe could potentially make sending specific coins less tedious on the RPC, but that's outside the scope of this PR. Ideally you would want a new RPC call that returns a concise list of outpoints with their amount, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n16a9...97f:7 0.000100\r\n34fe...e8d:0 0.00200\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could even use transaction short ids, if there's no duplicate in any given wallet (return the full id if there is).\r\n\r\nAnd then rather than the tedious options dictionary with an object for each input, we'd add one argument which takes a simple array of strings, so you can do `sendall bc1q09...hufdl null unset 1.1 '[\"16a9...97f:7\"]'` in order to spend the first coin. Still not super pretty, but when copy-pasted and adjusted from the help example, it should be easy enough to use.\r\n\r\nTo burn dust we could add an option `burn` that, if zero addresses are provided, will send to `OP_RETURN`. That way you might sweep economic coins with a slightly higher fee and then make a burn transaction for the rest at 1 sat/vbyte (or 0 if you have a way to get those mined).",

[This has already been discussed in the original PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24118#issuecomment-1029462114). \r\nBy not going through that path, it never checks the transaction's weight \r\nagainst the maximum tx weight for transactions we're willing to relay.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/447f50e4aed9a8b1d80e1891cda85801aeb80b4e/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L1013-L1018\r\nThis PR adds a check for tx-size as well as test coverage for that case.\r\n\r\n_Note: It seems that the test takes a bit of time on slower machines, \r\nI'm not sure if dropping it might be for the better._",

          "title": "wallet: Sweep function and deprecating subtractFeeFromOutputs",
          "body": "The subtractFeeFromOutputs function has long been the cause of many issues in coin selection. It is unclear whether it is being used for things other than sweeping the entire wallet balance, and sweeping specific inputs (i.e. spending inputs without creating change and without figuring out the feerate manually). Many issues opened about subtractFeeFromOutputs indicate that users are using it for sweeping, and the linked issue in the PR that adds it also discusses sweeping as the intended feature. Instead of using subtractFeeFromOutputs in order to implement this feature, it makes more sense to me to add specific functionality for sweeping. This would allow us to de-complicate our coin selection code by removing subtractFeeFromOutputs.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThere are a few specific things that I would want to see in a sweep function, besides the obvious spending all UTXOs with one destination.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that users will want to sweep to multiple destinations, so the sweep function should optionally allow users to specify amounts with addresses. If no amount is provided for an address, then the remaining value being swept will be sent to that address. Furthermore, multiple addresses may have no amount specified, in which case the remainder is split equally among the addresses, much in the same way that subtractFeeFromOutputs currently distributes the fee among the outputs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, sweeping may be used to sweep only specific inputs. So this sweep function should be able to allow users to specify which inputs to use. All specified inputs should be spent. If no inputs are provided, then the entire wallet will be spent.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways this could be implemented. The obvious is a new RPC with an API similar to `send` so that all of the relevant options can be provided. This would allow for a psbt to be returned in the case that the wallet does not have private keys, or if the user requests it. Another way would be to add it as an option to `send`, however I don't think that the API for using it would be easy to understand. For the GUI, there should be a dedicated button.\r\n\r\nInternally, it should be completely separate from existing coin selection (i.e. not in `CreateTransaction`, `SelectCoins`, or `AttemptSelection`).\r\n\r\nLastly, when sweep is implemented, subtractFeeFromOutputs should be added to `-deprecatedrpc` and the option removed from the GUI. Users should be informed that they can use the sweep function if that is what they are doing. Otherwise they can open an issue to discuss their use case. After one (or two) major release with `-deprecatedrpc` and no users complaining about a use case for subtractFeeFromOutputs that was not sweeping, then the subtractFeeFromOutputs option can be removed and the code for handling it removed from coin selection.",

I can also see that the `sweep` RPC is modeled after the `send` RPC. However, I am not sure if it is an optimal behavior. I can't understand why the user is compelled to input both of these options as either options or as arguments. Why not allow them to pass the first `conf_target` in one way and `estimate_mode` in another. Similar to what is done with `fee_rate`.",
