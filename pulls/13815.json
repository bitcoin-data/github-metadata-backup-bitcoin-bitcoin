Perhaps we should go with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#ifdef __has_cpp_attribute\r\n#  if __has_cpp_attribute(nodiscard)\r\n#    define NODISCARD [[nodiscard]]\r\n#  endif\r\n#else\r\n#  define NODISCARD __attribute__((warn_unused_result))\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will have the benefit of being less verbose. That would use the newer `[[nodiscard]]` (required from C++17) where available and fall back on the older `__attribute__((warn_unused_result))`.\r\n\r\nMakes sense?\r\n\r\nWhat would be the most appropriate file to put that `#define` in?\r\n\r\n @MarcoFalke, any input?",
