Perhaps we should go with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#ifdef __has_cpp_attribute\r\n#  if __has_cpp_attribute(nodiscard)\r\n#    define NODISCARD [[nodiscard]]\r\n#  endif\r\n#else\r\n#  define NODISCARD __attribute__((warn_unused_result))\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will have the benefit of being less verbose. That would use the newer `[[nodiscard]]` (required from C++17) where available and fall back on the older `__attribute__((warn_unused_result))`.\r\n\r\nMakes sense?\r\n\r\nWhat would be the most appropriate file to put that `#define` in?\r\n\r\n @MarcoFalke, any input?",

The reason that I use macros is that developers might not want to pass second parameter `utf8` everytime when they call `string` or create `path` objects.\r\n\r\nI tried to find all `string` methods and convert them to `u8string` except for external api calls. Also tried to convert explicit or implicit `path` to `u8path`. Tell me if you find something that I missed.\r\n\r\nRequired: bitcoin-core/leveldb#18\r\n\r\nSee #13787 for travis run result\r\n\r\n\r\nCaution: The user must change their config file to be utf-8 encoded if the file contains any non-ascii characters in it. Before 0.18, they are read as ansi-encoded characters on Windows.\r\n--",

          "body": "After PR #13033 and PR #13243 there is a useful framework to add more indexes other than txindex, however circular dependencies detected by lint (`index/txindex -> validation -> index/txindex` and `index/txindex -> index/base -> validation -> index/txindex`) would prevent such solution to pass CI checks without adding an exception rule in check scrypt. In case one calls newly added index method in `validation.cpp`, another circular dependency is created because new index is supposed to inherit from index/base. My proposition is to split `validation.cpp` into two parts, one with its core features / functionalities and other with utils used in other translation units that require including `validation`. No functional change in code is expected here as it is only moved between files, and a circular dependency is removed.",

This allows the `walletprocesspsbt` to include the BIP 32 derivation paths for keys that it is watching that are from a different HD wallet.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this easier to use, a new field `hdmasterkeyfingerprint` has been added to `getaddressinfo`. Additionally I have removed `hdmasterkeyid` as was planned. I think that this API change is fine since it was going to be removed in 0.18 anyways. `CKeyMetadata` has also been extended to store key origin info to facilitate this.",

Then derive `class CTransaction` from `CPureTransaction`\r\n* Deduce a `CPureBlock` which references `CPureTransactions` in its `vtx`.\r\n\r\nDeserialization now only takes 14% of the wall clock time it took previously on my machine. You can check locally with:\r\n```\r\n./bench_bitcoin --filter=DeserializeBlockTest && ./bench_bitcoin --filter=DeserializePureBlockTest\r\n```\r\nSending a single historic block now takes slightly less (90% of the wall clock time it took previously) on a local network. I presume the speedup is more pronounced when sending more than one block.",

          "body": "This PR is the last in a chain of PRs (#14437, #14711, and #15288) that make the wallet code access node state through an abstract [`Chain`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/wipc-sep/src/interfaces/chain.h) class in [`src/interfaces/`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/wipc-sep/src/interfaces) instead of using global variables like `cs_main`, `chainActive`, and `g_connman`. After this PR, wallet code no longer accesses global variables declared outside the wallet directory, and no longer calls functions accessing those globals (as verified by the `hide-globals` script in #10244).\r\n\r\nThis PR and the previous PRs have been refactoring changes that do not affect behavior. Previous PRs have consisted of lots of mechanical changes like:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    wtx.nTimeReceived = GetAdjustedTime();\r\n+    wtx.nTimeReceived = m_chain->getAdjustedTime();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller, but less mechanical. It replaces last few bits of wallet code that access node state directly (through `CValidationInterface`, `CRPCTable`, and `CCoinsViewMemPool` interfaces) with code that uses the `Chain` interface.\r\n\r\nThese changes allow followup PR #10102 (multiprocess gui & wallet PR) to work without any significant updates to wallet code. Additionally they:\r\n\r\n* Provide a single place to describe the interface between wallet and node code.\r\n* Can make better wallet testing possible, because the `Chain` object consists of virtual methods that can be overloaded for mocking. (This could be used to test edge cases in the rescan code, for example).",

The obvious downsides are that any function that accepts such a string needs to check if it is one of the known ones and return a runtime error when not found.\r\n\r\nThis check can be done at compile time by using a `switch` statement on an `enum class`.\r\n\r\nTo not refactor all the existing code, this first introduces the type-safe `enum class ChainType` and then runs a scripted diff on all instances where we can benefit from the new class. I intend to remove the throwing and now deprecated methods that pass around the string in a future patch.",

          "body": "Conjunction of a large number of back ports, updates and refactorings that made with the final goal of implementing v3 Onion addresses support (BIP155 https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki) before the tor v2 addresses EOL, scheduled, by the Tor project, for (1) July 15th: v2 addr support removal from the code base, and (2) October 15th: v2 addr network disable, where **every peer in our network running under Tor will loose the connection and drop the network**.\r\n\r\nAs BIP155 describes, this is introducing a new P2P message to gossip longer node addresses over the P2P network. This is required to support new-generation Onion addresses, I2P, and potentially other networks that have longer endpoint addresses than fit in the 128 bits of the current addr message.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the end goal, had to:\r\n1.  Create Span class and push it up to latest Bitcoin implementation. \r\n2.  Update the whole serialization framework and every object using it up to latest Bitcoin implementation (3-4 years ahead of what we currently are in master).\r\n3.  Update the address manager implementing ASN-based bucketing of the network nodes.\r\n4.  Update and refactor the netAddress and address manager tests to latest Bitcoin implementation (4 years ahead of what we currently are in master).\r\n5.  Several util string, vector, encodings, parsing, hashing backports and more..\r\n\r\nImportant note: \r\nThis PR it is not meant to be merged as a standalone PR, will decouple smaller ones moving on. Adding on each sub-PR its own description isolated from this big monster.\r\n\r\nSecond note:\r\nThis is still a **work-in-progress**, not ready for testing yet. I'm probably missing to mention few PRs that have already adapted to our sources. Just making it public so can decouple the changes, we can start merging them and i can continue working a bit more confortable (rebase a +170 commits separate branch is not fun..).\r\n\r\n### List of back ported and adapted PRs:\r\n\r\nSpan and Serialization:\r\n----------------\r\n*  #12886.\r\n*  #12916.\r\n*  #13558.\r\n*  #13697.
