    "body": "This is an implementation of [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518), using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki)). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk on the topic is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670).\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I'll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n- save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n- increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n- improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\nObviously looking for review, let's try to start with a high-level concerns, and keep nits for later.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nPlease don't be scared of 8,000 LOC added. 7,000 of them is minisketch added as a subtree.\r\n\r\nP.P.S.\r\nMy experiments of running this code live (slightly outdated) with a script to replicate the experiment: [here1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-599241490) and [here2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-600388543).\r\n",

It's uses a way of communicating lists of things you want to relay which only takes bandwidth proportional to the difference rather than the total size.  So there is no on-going bandwidth usage due to differences in *mempool* content. Bandwidth is used is roughly  A*ntx_relayed + B*peers*(difference_in_tx_relayed) + C*peers.  for some constants A,B,C. \r\n\r\nIf a peer has a radically different relay policy than you, it works fine and continues to save bandwidth below what usage would be without erlay even though the erlay savings itself comes largely from eliminating data that both sides would send.\r\n\r\nDoes that answer your question?",

The running times of these are quite substantial - is there some way to do a quick sanity check as part of `make check` instead of exhaustive testing? :)\r\n",

          "title": "Use wtxid for transaction relay",
          "body": "Using txids (a transaction's hash, without witness) for transaction relay is problematic, post-segwit -- if a peer gives us a segwit transaction that fails policy checks, it could be because the txid associated with the transaction is definitely unacceptable to our node (regardless of the witness), or it could be that the transaction was malleated and with a different witness, the txid could be accepted to our mempool.\r\n\r\nWe have a bloom filter of recently rejected transactions, whose purpose is to help us avoid redownloading and revalidating transactions that fail to be accepted, but because of this potential for witness malleability to interfere with relay of valid transactions, we do not use the filter for segwit transactions.  This issue is discussed at some length in #8279.  The effect of this is that whenever a segwit transaction that fails policy checks is relayed, a node would download that transaction from every peer announcing it, because it has no way presently to cache failure.  Historically this hasn't been a big problem, but if/when policy for accepting segwit transactions were to change (eg taproot, or any other change), we could expect older nodes talking to newer nodes to be wasting bandwidth because of this.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in that issue, switching to wtxid-based relay solves this problem -- by using an identifier for a transaction that commits to all the data in our relay protocol, we can be certain if a transaction that a peer is announcing is one that we've already tried to process, or if it's something new.  This PR introduces support for wtxid-based relay with peers that support it (and remains backwards compatible with peers that use txids for relay, of course).\r\n\r\nApart from code correctness, one issue to be aware of is that by downloading from old and new peers alike, we should expect there to be some bandwidth wasted, because sometimes we might download the same transaction via txid-relay as well as wtxid-relay.  The last commit in this PR implements a heuristic I want to analyze, which is to just delay relay from txid-relay peers by 2 seconds, if we have at least 1 wtxid-based peer.  I've just started running a couple nodes with this heuristic so I can measure how well it works, but I'm open to other ideas for minimizing that issue.  In the long run, I think this will be essentially a non-issue, so I don't think it's too big a concern, we just need to bite the bullet and deal with it during upgrade.\r\n\r\nFinally, this proposal would need a simple BIP describing the changes, which I haven't yet drafted.  However, review and testing of this code in the interim would be welcome.\r\n\r\nTo do items:\r\n- [x] Write BIP explaining the spec here (1 new p2p message for negotiating wtxid-based relay, along with a new INV type)\r\n- [ ] Measure and evaluate a heuristic for minimizing how often a node downloads the same transaction twice, when connected to old and new nodes.",

Enables high-level fuzzing of the P2P layer.\r\n\r\nAll code paths reachable from this fuzzer can be assumed to be reachable for an untrusted peer.\r\n\r\nSeeded from thin air (an empty corpus) this fuzzer reaches roughly 20 000 lines of code.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make distclean\r\n$ ./autogen.sh\r\n$ CC=clang CXX=clang++ ./configure --enable-fuzz \\\r\n      --with-sanitizers=address,fuzzer,undefined\r\n$ make\r\n$ src/test/fuzz/process_message\r\n…\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorth noting about this fuzzing harness:\r\n* To achieve a reasonable number of executions per seconds the state of the fuzzer is unfortunately not entirely reset between `test_one_input` calls. The set-up (`FuzzingSetup` ctor) and tear-down (`~FuzzingSetup`) work is simply too costly to be run on every iteration. There is a trade-off to handle here between a.) achieving high executions/second and b.) giving the fuzzer a totally blank slate for each call. Please let me know if you have any suggestion on how to improve this situation while maintaining >1000 executions/second. \r\n* To achieve optimal results when using coverage-guided fuzzing I've chosen to create one specialised fuzzing binary per message type (`process_message_addr`, `process_message_block`, `process_message_blocktxn `, etc.) and one general fuzzing binary (`process_message`) which handles all messages types. The latter general fuzzer can be seeded with inputs generated by the former specialised fuzzers.\r\n\r\nHappy fuzzing friends!",

      "body": "More experiments: now I ran the same 2 nodes for 24 hours, but connected to 16 instead of 8 nodes (yeah, all 16 peers of Erlay node support reconciliation).\r\n\r\nLegacy wtxid-relay node spent 150 megabytes for announcements, while Erlay node spent 24 megabytes. Since these 2 days might have had different activity, it makes sense to compare the growth.. Legacy grew 2.23x (I guess due to more INVs in total), Erlay grew 1.8x. So, as expected, not only it's decent savings comparing to legacy, it also grows slower with connectivity.\r\n\r\nBased on the following facts I also make a guess that there's no point in tweaking Erlay forward for better performance:\r\n- only 0.0016 reconciliation failed (fully or partially) — meaning we don't underestimate much\r\n- only 15% of the announcement bandwidth is sketches — meaning we don't overestimate much\r\n- only 15% of the announcement bandwidth is *outbound* invs (which are much more likely to still be a little wasteful, because those peers are better connected than us and likely don't need those announemens)\r\n\r\nFinally, I measured delay in receiving transactions. I take the earliest time I received a transaction, and take latency from there, comparing to:\r\n- an average receiving time at all legacy nodes: 0.92s \r\n- at the Erlay node: 1.47s\r\n\r\nI think this is expected and fine, as we talk in the paper, but let me know if you think differently.",

          "body": "This PR introduces mempool tracking of unbroadcast transactions and periodic reattempts at initial broadcast. This is a part of the rebroadcast project, and a standalone privacy win. \r\n\r\nThe current rebroadcast logic is terrible for privacy because 1. only the source wallet rebroadcasts transactions and 2. it does so quite frequently. In the current system, if a user submits a transaction that does not immediately get broadcast to the network (eg. they are offline), this \"rebroadcast\" behavior is the safety net that can actually serve as the initial broadcast. So, keeping the attempts frequent is important for initial delivery within a reasonable timespan. \r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve # 2 by reducing the wallet rebroadcast frequency to ~1/day from ~1/15 min. It achieves this by separating the notion of initial broadcast from rebroadcasts. With these changes, the mempool tracks locally submitted transactions & periodically reattempts initial broadcast. Transactions submitted via the wallet or RPC are added to an \"unbroadcast\" set & are removed when a peer sends a `getdata` request, or the transaction is removed from the mempool. Every 10-15 minutes, the node reattempts an initial broadcast. This enables reducing the wallet rebroadcast frequency while ensuring the transactions will be propagated to the network. \r\n\r\nFor privacy improvements around # 1, please see #16698. \r\nThank you to gmaxwell for the idea of how to break out this subset of functionality (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16698#issuecomment-571399346)",

Assuming it ever made it to another peer.\r\n`REORG` | Removed for reorganization | Block races are rare, so reorgs should be rarer. Also the tx will be reaccepted from the `disconnectpool` later on and then relayed (TODO), so this should never be observable in practise.\r\n`BLOCK` | Removed for block | The other peer will eventually receive the (filtered)block with the tx in it.\r\n`CONFLICT` | Removed for conflict with in-block transaction | The peer won't be able to add the tx to the mempool anyway. No need to waste bandwidth.\r\n`REPLACED` | Removed for replacement | Same as above, send them the higher fee tx instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should also improve transaction relay privacy slightly. Previously any peer (even inbounds) could ask for transactions in `mapRelay`, even if they were never announced to them via an `inv` message. After my changes, the peer can only request transactions that were added to the mempool before the last `inv` message was sent to that peer.",

Second patch just dumps some statistics on how successful connections are (successful = connection established, not a VERACK actually received).

          "body": "This PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an `--enable-multiprocess` configure option which builds new `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables with relevant functionality isolated into different processes. See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n",

If `CheckBlock()` or `AcceptBlock()` fails, then PNB returns to net processing without calling the (asynchronous) `BlockChecked` Validation Interface method. net processing can use the invalid `BlockValidationState` returned to punish peers.\r\n\r\n`CheckBlock()` and `AcceptBlock()` represent the DoS checks on a block (ie PoW and malleability). Net processing wants to know about those failed checks immediately and shouldn't have to wait on a callback. Other validation interface clients don't care about net processing submitting bogus malleated blocks to validation, so they don't need to be notified of `BlockChecked`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if PNB returns a valid `BlockValidationState`, we never need to try to process (non-malleated) copies of the block from other peers. That makes it much easier to move the best chain activation logic to a background thread in future work.",

This is the last PR required for BIP 157/158 compatibility.\r\n\r\nIf the node has the block filter index enabled, once the index is in sync, the node will begin signaling the BIP 158 service bit and responding to BIP 157 requests. On invalid requests, the node disconnects the offending peer.\r\n\r\nThis is tested using functional tests. I have also synced an [lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) testnet node using the neutrino backend connected to a Core node running this code.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n- Should there be a separate CLI flag other than `-blockfilterindex` to enable serving of filters from the index?\r\n- Is the mechanism to only signal the service flag once the index is in sync OK?\r\n- Is the use of `boost::shared_lock` around the checkpoint cache acceptable?",

As a result, NOTFOUND is sent and the synchronization never happens. \r\nI haven't been able to dig in deep enough yet to understand the cause, but there still seems to be a bug somewhere. ",

The chainstate manager is primarily needed for the assumeutxo feature, but it can also simplify testing in the future.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this pull is to make the global chainstate manager internal to validation, so that all external code does not depend on globals and that unit or fuzz tests can pass in their (potentially mocked) chainstate manager.\r\n\r\nI suggest reviewing the pull request commit-by-commit. It should be relatively straightforward refactoring that does not change behavior at all.",

It adds an `--enable-multiprocess` autoconf option (off by default and marked experimental), that builds new `bitcoin-node` and `bitcoin-gui` binaries. These currently function the same as existing `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` binaries, but are extended in #10102 with IPC features to execute node, wallet, and gui functions in separate processes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to adding the `--enable-multiprocess` config flag, it also adds a depends package and autoconf rules to build with the [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess) library, and it adds new travis configuration to exercise the build code and run functional tests with the new binaries.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR were originally part of #10102 but were moved into #16367 to be able to develop and review the multiprocess build changes independently of the code changes. #16367 was briefly merged and then reverted in #18588. Only change since #16367 has been dropping the `native_boost.mk` depends package which was pointed out to be no longer necessary in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16367#issuecomment-596484337 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18588#pullrequestreview-391765649",

The node does a best-effort of delivering the transactions to the network via retries every 10-15 minutes until either a `GETDATA` is received or the transaction is removed from the mempool.",

          "title": "wallet: Add sqlite as an alternative wallet database and use it for new descriptor wallets",
          "body": "This PR adds a new class `SQLiteDatabase` which is a subclass of `WalletDatabase`. This provides access to a SQLite database that is used to store the wallet records. To keep compatibility with BDB and to complexity of the change down, we don't make use of many SQLite's features. We use it strictly as a key-value store. We create a table `main` which has two columns, `key` and `value` both with the type `blob`.\r\n\r\nFor new descriptor wallets, we will create a `SQLiteDatabase` instead of a `BerkeleyDatabase`. There is no requirement that all SQLite wallets are descriptor wallets, nor is there a requirement that all descriptor wallets be SQLite wallets. This allows for existing descriptor wallets to work as well as keeping open the option to migrate existing wallets to SQLite.\r\n\r\nWe keep the name `wallet.dat` for SQLite wallets. We are able to determine which database type to use by searching for specific magic bytes in the `wallet.dat` file. SQLite begins it's files with a null terminated string `SQLite format 3`. BDB has `0x00053162` at byte 12 (note that the byte order of this integer depends on the system endianness). So when we see that there is a `wallet.dat` file that we want to open, we check for the magic bytes to determine which database system to use.\r\n\r\nI decided to keep the `wallet.dat` naming to keep things like backup script to continue to function as they won't need to be modified to look for a different file name. It also simplifies a couple of things in the implementation and the tests as `wallet.dat` is something that is specifically being looked for. If we don't want this behavior, then I do have another branch which creates `wallet.sqlite` files instead, but I find that this direction is easier.",

          "body": "Replace current benchmarking framework with nanobench\r\n\r\nThis replaces the current benchmarking framework with nanobench [1], an\r\nMIT licensed single-header benchmarking library, of which I am the\r\nautor. This has in my opinion several advantages, especially on Linux:\r\n\r\n* fast: Running all benchmarks takes ~6 seconds instead of 4m13s on\r\n  an Intel i7-8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz.\r\n\r\n* accurate: I ran e.g. the benchmark for SipHash_32b 10 times and\r\n  calculate standard deviation / mean = coefficient of variation:\r\n\r\n  * 0.57% CV for old benchmarking framework\r\n  * 0.20% CV for nanobench\r\n\r\n  So the benchmark results with nanobench seem to vary less than with\r\n  the old framework.\r\n\r\n* It automatically determines runtime based on clock precision, no need\r\n  to specify number of evaluations.\r\n\r\n* measure instructions, cycles, branches, instructions per cycle,\r\n  branch misses (only Linux, when performance counters are available)\r\n\r\n* output in markdown table format.\r\n\r\n* Warn about unstable environment (frequency scaling, turbo, ...)\r\n\r\n* For better profiling, it is possible to set the environment variable\r\n  NANOBENCH_ENDLESS to force endless running of a particular benchmark\r\n  without the need to recompile. This makes it to e.g. run \"perf top\"\r\n  and look at hotspots.\r\n\r\nHere is an example copy & pasted from the terminal output:\r\n\r\n|             ns/byte |              byte/s |    err% |        ins/byte |        cyc/byte |    IPC |       bra/byte |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|----------------:|-------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|                2.52 |      396,529,415.94 |    0.6% |           25.42 |            8.02 |  3.169 |           0.06 |    0.0% |      0.03 | `bench/crypto_hash.cpp RIPEMD160`\r\n|                1.87 |      535,161,444.83 |    0.3% |           21.36 |            5.95 |  3.589 |           0.06 |    0.0% |      0.02 | `bench/crypto_hash.cpp SHA1`\r\n|                3.22 |      310,344,174.79 |    1.1% |           36.80 |           10.22 |  3.601 |           0.09 |    0.0% |      0.04 | `bench/crypto_hash.cpp SHA256`\r\n|                2.01 |      496,375,796.23 |    0.0% |           18.72 |            6.43 |  2.911 |           0.01 |    1.0% |      0.00 | `bench/crypto_hash.cpp SHA256D64_1024`\r\n|                7.23 |      138,263,519.35 |    0.1% |           82.66 |           23.11 |  3.577 |           1.63 |    0.1% |      0.00 | `bench/crypto_hash.cpp SHA256_32b`\r\n|                3.04 |      328,780,166.40 |    0.3% |           35.82 |            9.69 |  3.696 |           0.03 |    0.0% |      0.03 | `bench/crypto_hash.cpp SHA512`\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/martinus/nanobench",

The tx request logic is updated to use these instead of uint256s, permitting per-announcement distinguishing of txid/wtxid (instead of assuming that everything we want to request from a wtxid peer is wtx). Then the restriction of orphan-parent requesting to non-wtxid peers is lifted.\r\n\r\nAlso document BIP339 in doc/bips.md.",

          "body": "We currently have two structures for per-peer data:\r\n\r\n- `CNode` in net, which should just contain connection layer data (eg socket, send/recv buffers, etc), but currently also contains some application layer data (eg tx/block inventory).\r\n- `CNodeState` in net processing, which contains p2p application layer data, but requires cs_main to be locked for access.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a third struct `Peer`, which is for p2p application layer data, and doesn't require cs_main. Eventually all application layer data from `CNode` should be moved to `Peer`, and any data that doesn't strictly require cs_main should be moved from `CNodeState` to `Peer` (probably all of `CNodeState` eventually).\r\n\r\n`Peer` objects are stored as shared pointers in a net processing global map `g_peer_map`, which is protected by `g_peer_mutex`. To use a `Peer` object, `g_peer_mutex` is locked, a copy of the shared pointer is taken, and the lock is released. Individual members of `Peer` are protected by different mutexes that guard related data. The lifetime of the `Peer` object is managed by the shared_ptr refcount.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `Peer` object and moves the misbehaving data from `CNodeState` to `Peer`. This allows us to immediately remove 15 `LOCK(cs_main)` instances.\r\n\r\nFor more motivation see #19398",

          "body": "**This is part 1 of #19315, which enables the ability to test `outbound` and `block-relay-only` connections from the functional tests.** Please see that PR for more information of overall functionality.\r\n\r\n**This PR simplifies how we manage different connection types.** It introduces an enum with the various types of connections so we can explicitly define the connection type. The existing system relies on a series of independent flags, then has asserts scattered around to ensure that conflicting flags are not enabled at the same time. I find this approach to be both brittle and confusing. While making these changes, I found a small bug due to the silent assumptions. \r\n\r\nThis PR also proposes a rename from `OneShot` to `AddrFetch`. I find the name `OneShot` to be very confusing, especially when we also have `onetry` manual connections. Everyone I've talked to offline has agreed that the name is confusing, so I propose a potential alternative. I think this is a good opportunity for a rename since I'm creating an enum to explicitly define the connection types. \r\n(some context for the unfamiliar: `oneshot` or `addrfetch` connections are short-lived connections created on startup. They connect to the seed peers, send a `getaddr` to solicit addresses, then close the connection.)\r\n\r\nOverview of this PR: \r\n* rename `oneshot` to `addrfetch`\r\n* introduce `ConnectionType` enum \r\n* one by one, add different connection types to the enum \r\n* expose the `conn_type` on CNode, and use this to reduce reliance on flags (& asserts) \r\n* fix the bug in counting different type of connections \r\n* some additional cleanup to simplify logic and make expectations explicit/inclusive rather than implicit/exclusive. \r\n",

To ease review it is split in a few logical changes and submitted as separate, smaller, PRs.\r\n\r\nThe current one for review is: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19954\r\n\r\nPreparation changes\r\n---\r\nCommits:\r\n* [x] `test: add an edge case test for CSubNet` (merged via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19351)\r\n* [x] `net: improve encapsulation of CNetAddr` (merged via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19360)\r\n* [x] `net: document enum Network` (merged via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19534)\r\n* [x] `net: save the network type explicitly in CNetAddr` (merged via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19534)\r\n\r\nChange `CNetAddr::ip` to have flexible size\r\n---\r\nCommits:\r\n* [x] `net: change CNetAddr::ip to have flexible size` (merged via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19628)\r\n\r\nImplement `addrv2` (un)serializing\r\n---\r\nAdd support to serialize `CNetAddr` and `CAddress` in [ADDRv2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki#specification) format. Invoke that from `CAddrMan` serialization methods. Commits:\r\n* [x] `net: move HasPrefix() so it can be reused` (merged via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19845)\r\n* [x] `test: move HasReason() so it can be reused` (merged via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19845)\r\n* [x] `net: CNetAddr: add support to (un)serialize as ADDRv2` (merged via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19845)\r\n* [x] `net: recognize TORv3/I2P/CJDNS networks` (merged via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19845)\r\n* [x] `net: CAddress & CAddrMan: (un)serialize as ADDRv2` (merged via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19954)\r\n\r\nAdvertise support\r\n---\r\nAdvertise `ADDRv2` support to peers, handle incoming `ADDRv2` messages and send to peers in that format if they have advertised support. Commits:\r\n* [x] `net: advertise support for ADDRv2 via new message` (merged via https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19954)\r\n\r\nAll the steps to get Tor v3 support are outlined in [issue#18884 Tor v3 support](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18884), this PR is one of them.",

This also avoids issues where it was accidentally not included in the version number.\r\n\r\nThe CLIENT_VERSION remains the same format as previous as previously, as the Major version was 0 so it never actually got included in it.\r\n\r\nThe user agent string formatter is updated to follow this new versioning.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHonestly I'm just tired of all of the people asking for \"1.0\" that maybe this'll shut them up. Skip the whole 1.0 thing and go straight to version 22.0!\r\n\r\nAlso, this means that the terminology we commonly use lines up with how the variables are named.

We get clearer visibility into what currently lies in consensus codepaths **and** what depends on our consensus engine\r\n> 1. We can coalesce duplicate consensus initialization codepaths, mitigating against bugs that arise out of test/non-test initialization inconsistencies\r\n\r\n### De-globalizing `g_chainman`\r\n\r\nExcerpt from #20049\r\n> In order to modularize our consensus engine, we need to first de-globalize the global `ChainstateManager` -- namely `g_chainman` -- as it and its dependencies are what makes up the bulk of our consensus engine. A few direct references to `g_chainman` have already been removed in #19927, however, its indirect uses (mainly via `::Chain(state|)Active()`) are numerous in our codebase and often used to ~~cheat~~ avoid obtaining a `ChainstateManager` reference.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis changeset moves the global `ChainstateManger` to `NodeContext` and removes `::Chain{state,}Active()` as a first step towards better modularization of our consensus engine. \r\n\r\nThe commits are ordered as such:\r\n1. Fixes to our existing codebase crucial to subsequent changes in this changeset\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...dongcarl:2020-10-chainman-fixes\r\n1.

They are removed in 2236237070a45fe570cd0113f0025b0a46ac89be.\r\n",

We no longer need the 2 workarounds described above. (They are\r\n       dropped in later commits)\r\n    1. By default and without any overrides, whatever $PATH is at\r\n       configure-time, is whatever $PATH is at make-time.\r\n    2. When configuring with depends' CONFIG_SITE, the\r\n       $depends_prefix/native/bin prepend to $PATH stays there unless\r\n       overridden manually by a ./configure PATH=... or make PATH=...\r\n\r\n    I believe that this makes using our depends system and our build system\r\n    much more consistent, and still allows overrides to be easily made by\r\n    those who need it.",

This limits our ability to add integration tests for our networking code, which often executes different code paths for different connection types. \r\n\r\n**This PR enables creating `outbound` & `block-relay-only` P2P connections in the functional tests.** This allows us to increase our p2p test coverage, since we can now verify expectations around these connection types.\r\n\r\nThis builds out the [prototype](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14210#issuecomment-527421978) proposed by ajtowns in #14210. 🙌🏽\r\n\r\nAn overview of this branch:\r\n- introduces a new test-only RPC function `addconnection` which initiates opening an `outbound` or `block-relay-only` connection. (conceptually similar to `addnode` but for different connection types & restricted to regtest)\r\n- adds `test_framework` support so a mininode can open an `outbound`/`block-relay-only` connection to a `P2PInterface`/`P2PConnection`.\r\n- updates `p2p_blocksonly` tests to create a `block-relay-only` connection & verify expectations around transaction relay. \r\n- introduces `p2p_add_connections` test that checks the behaviors of the newly introduced `add_outbound_p2p_connection` test framework function. \r\n\r\nWith these changes, there are many more behaviors that we can add integration tests for. The blocksonly updates is just one example. \r\n\r\nHuge props to ajtowns for conceiving the approach & providing me feedback as I've built out this branch. Also thank you to jnewbery for lots of thoughtful input along the way. ",

      "body": "Me and @sipa decided to switch to \"extension sketches\": instead of requesting a bisection, someone who failed to decode the difference from the initial sketch, may ask for an extension of the initial sketch.\r\nA responder then have to send syndromes of higher order only.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation is it seems like bisection adds a lot of complexity (see b5c92a41e4cc0599504cf838d20212f1a403e573).\r\nExtensions have all the same properties after all, but they're more CPU-costly. We think it's fine for sketches of small capacity (what we expect to have here) to ignore this disadvantage.\r\n\r\nSo, for now, please review up to a30e861c9cada8fbc400d07255516839480d9e9d (but also feel free to review further if you're curious).\r\n\r\nI will replace bisection with extensions and update the BIP soon.",

This caused a problem because `$(BOOST_CPPFLAGS)` contained `-I/usr/local/include` and the include paths are searched by the compiler in order from left to right, so in the end `$(BITCOIN_INCLUDES)` contained `-I/usr/local/include` before `-I$(srcdir)/secp256k1/include` which caused the compiler to find  `secp256k1.h` under `/usr/local/include`.\r\n\r\nLooking at git blame i am wondering how this has not happened to anyone else in several years: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blame/cb89e18845852c005ba8ab94acc6544d7c876a42/src/Makefile.am#L25\r\n\r\nI am on macOS 10.15.",

In the \"log-and-abort\" mode the\r\n       invocation of an unexpected syscall results in a debug handler\r\n       being invoked which will log the incident and terminate the\r\n       program (without executing the unexpected syscall).

Should it attempt any other system calls, the kernel will terminate the process with SIGKILL or SIGSYS. In this sense, it does not virtualize the system's resources but isolates the process from them entirely.\r\n>\r\n> […]\r\n> \r\n> seccomp-bpf is an extension to seccomp that allows filtering of system calls using a configurable policy implemented using Berkeley Packet Filter rules. It is used by OpenSSH and vsftpd as well as the Google Chrome/Chromium web browsers on Chrome OS and Linux. (In this regard seccomp-bpf achieves similar functionality, but with more flexibility and higher performance, to the older systrace—which seems to be no longer supported for Linux.)",

If BIP 330 implies BIP 339, it could be better to remove references to transaction ID or at least when it's ambiguous\r\n3) You mentioned switching to extension sketch and mentioned the updated BIP was ready for review, I think you need to update the \"intented protocol flow\" schema, remove `reqbisec` and update Rationale ?\r\n4) You might swap the \"Local State\" section before messages, it could be easier to explain q-coefficient before using them in New messages\r\n",

          "body": "This small patch updates the ignore list for the spelling linter script (which uses `codespell`), both removing false-positives that are not relevant anymore and adding new ones. As [suggested by jonatack](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20762#issuecomment-750889701)~~, whose last name is now also part of the list :)~~. Also changed the linter script to not check the gitian keys file, as [suggested by hebasto](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20817#discussion_r550763409). The codespell version used is bumped to most recent version 2.0.0, which is more aware of some terms that were previously needed in the ignorelist for v1.17.1, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20817#issuecomment-753428669.\r\n\r\nRunning spelling linter on master branch (repeated findings in the same file are removed to keep the output short):\r\n```\r\n$ ./test/lint/lint-spelling.sh\r\ncontrib/gitian-keys/keys.txt:16: Atack ==> Attack\r\ndoc/developer-notes.md:1284: inout ==> input, in out\r\ndoc/psbt.md:122: Asend ==> Ascend, as end\r\nsrc/bench/verify_script.cpp:27: Keypair ==> Key pair\r\nsrc/blockencodings.h:30: Unser ==> Under, unset, unsure, user\r\nsrc/compressor.h:65: Unser ==> Under, unset, unsure, user\r\nsrc/core_read.cpp:131: presense ==> presence\r\nsrc/index/disktxpos.h:21: blockIn ==> blocking\r\nsrc/net_processing.h:67: anounce ==> announce\r\nsrc/netaddress.h:486: compatiblity ==> compatibility\r\nsrc/primitives/transaction.h:35: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/qt/bitcoinunits.cpp:101: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/rpc/blockchain.cpp:2150: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/rpc/misc.cpp:198: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/script/bitcoinconsensus.cpp:81: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/script/bitcoinconsensus.h:63: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/script/interpreter.cpp:1279: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/script/interpreter.h:222: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/script/sign.cpp:17: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/script/sign.h:39: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/serialize.h:181: Unser ==> Under, unset, unsure, user\r\nsrc/signet.cpp:142: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/test/base32_tests.cpp:17: fo ==> of, for\r\nsrc/test/base64_tests.cpp:17: fo ==> of, for\r\nsrc/test/script_tests.cpp:1509: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/test/sighash_tests.cpp:27: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/test/validation_tests.cpp:78: excercise ==> exercise\r\nsrc/undo.h:36: Unser ==> Under, unset, unsure, user\r\nsrc/validation.cpp:1403: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/validation.h:255: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/wallet/wallet.cpp:1532: nIn ==> inn, min, bin, nine\r\nsrc/wallet/walletdb.cpp:429: Crypted ==> Encrypted\r\ntest/functional/feature_nulldummy.py:63: unnecssary ==> unnecessary\r\ntest/functional/wallet_encryption.py:81: crypted ==> encrypted\r\ntest/functional/wallet_upgradewallet.py:36: fpr ==> for, far, fps\r\n^ Warning: codespell identified likely spelling errors.

          "body": "Compact blocks are used for efficient relay of blocks, either through High Bandwidth or Low Bandwidth mode. See [BIP 152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki) for full details.\r\n\r\nFor compact block relay to work, the receiver must have a mempool containing transactions which are likely to be included in the block. The receiver uses these transactions to reconstruct the block from the short transaction ids included in the `cmpctblock` message. Compact blocks are therefore only useful for relaying blocks at or near the tip of the block chain. For older blocks, the recipient won't have the transactions in their mempool and so would need to request them using a `getblocktxn` message. In such cases, just requesting the full block is more efficient.\r\n\r\nBIP 152 supports two versions: version 1 (without witnesses) and version 2 (with witnesses). Version 2 is required to reconstruct segwit blocks. Segwit was activated in August 2017, and providing non-witness blocks to peers is no longer useful. Since the witnesses are not included, the peer would not be able to fully validate all the consensus rules on the provided block.\r\n\r\nTherefore, stop supporting version 1 compact blocks. Ignore `sendcmpct` messages with version=1, and don't advertise support by sending `sendcmpct` with version=1. Only send `sendcmpct` to peers with `NODE_WITNESS`. Respond to all requests for compact blocks or blocktxns with witness-serialized blocks and transactions.",

I agree with the comment here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#discussion_r541049259 that we should aim to separate this from the rest of net_processing. This PR currently has about 850 LOC change in net_processing.{cpp|h}, out of a total of around 5700 lines. That means ~15% of net_processing is erlay code after this PR (and over half of net_processing.h is erlay specific). Would it be possible to split the erlay logic into its own subcomponent? One immediate benefit for you is that there would be far fewer disruptive rebases if you did that.\r\n2. Could the minisketch code and tests be split into their own PR? It seems like there is pretty wide support for incorporating erlay. Reviewing and merging minisketch first would make this PR a lot smaller and more focused on just the p2p changes.",

The Erlay logic in this PR is spread across many functions in net_processing.cpp and reconcilliation.h, which means that it's impossible to test that logic in isolation. I suppose that's why there aren't any unit tests included in this PR.\r\n\r\nI think it would be much cleaner to have a fully separate module, similar to how txrequest was separated from the rest of net_processing. That module maintains its own private state and exposes a limited number of interface methods to net_processing. That means that it's possible to very thoroughly unit test and fuzz test that module in isolation.",

That means that `PeerManager` truly is net_processing's minimal interface to expose to the rest of the program.\r\n- If a test needs to directly manipulate `Peer` objects, it can do so, since they're exposed in peerman_impl header.

[p2p: Erlay support signaling](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23443) — done\r\n2. [Follow-up](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26359) — done\r\n3. [p2p: Fill reconciliation sets and request reconciliation (Erlay)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26283) — pending\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nPlease use this discussion for high-level topics and keep the nitpics for the sub-PRs. The state of this branch might be not the cleanest and the freshest, although last time I rebased in on 2022/05/12 to be in sync {with master, with the latest child PR} and pass CI (modulo one race condition issue).\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of  [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) , using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec  [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki) ). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670) .\r\n\r\nThis PR supersedes the previous [one](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261), because that one got too much review comments (I tried to resolve all of them for this version), and also it was much refactored since then.\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I’ll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n* save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n* increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n* improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\n### How to review\r\n\r\nI suggest doing `make clean && autogen.sh && configure` before you try building it locally.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nI created 2 discussion boards, please discuss not-code-related topics there:\r\n1. [Understanding bandwidth savings](https://github.com/naumenkogs/txrelaysim/issues/7)\r\n2. [Joining mainnet testing](https://github.com/naumenkogs/txrelaysim/issues/8)",

Since we reduce the poisson timer for peers we think we're reconciling with, this could be a way to game a quicker INV time to be a better spy node.\r\n  * this doesn't seem to actually work because they'd have to wait for 2 poisson timers to go off before getting the prior batch of announcements, which is approximately the same (other than integer division) as the same inv timer that inbound peers normally get. Though perhaps this would get them their own poisson timer, rather than having to use the bucket that all inbounds share?  That seems not great -- an adversary could use multiple inbound connections this way to effectively get a small poisson timer (on average).\r\n\r\n- Countervailing idea is that if the peer is just held up for some reason, the older transactions are more likely to reconcile successfully than the newest ones, so it's probably bandwidth minimizing in the honest case to hang on to the older ones in the reconciliation set.",

Should we add some sort of acknowledgement message so that both sides know whether reconciliation is enabled on the link?\r\n\r\nOur own logic seems to change based on whether we *think* we're reconciling with a peer; if some other implementation turns on both sending and responding (for instance) and then we silently ignore all their reconciliation requests, that seems suboptimal for everyone.  Likewise, if we think we've enabled reconciliation with a peer but it has a different policy, it would be better for our software to know that reconciliation isn't going to actually happen.",

If the other party announced recon protocol 2, things will just default to protocol 1 without problems (which means forcing any client that supports protocol 2 to also support protocol 1). If a change would be made that is so incompatible that we don't expect clients to support the old one anymore, a different negotiation message would be used, or 0 could be sent.\r\n\r\nIn commit \"Handle reconciliation support announcement\":\r\n\r\nThe code would be something like this to accomodate that:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n/* must match announcement logic */\r\nstatic constexpr uint32_t RECON_VERSION = 1;\r\nbool us_sender = !IsInBound(), us_responder = IsInBound(); \r\n\r\nbool they_sender, they_responder;\r\nvRecv >> they_sender >> they_responder >> recon_version >> remote_salt;\r\nrecon_version = std::min(recon_version, RECON_VERSION);\r\nif (recon_version < 1) return;\r\nbool recon_sender = us_sender && they_responder, recon_responder = us_responder && they_sender;\r\n// If we ever announce us_sender && us_responder, this will need tie-breaking (picking the outbound side as sender)\r\nassert(!(recon_sender && recon_responder));\r\n```\r\n",

That can be the same with reconciliation, we don't allocate sketch resources for low-fee transactions. \r\n\r\nThat said, I feel it should be part of a wider conversation about how we price better network resources while still flowing through the network what is \"near confirmation\".",

Ideally the module would abstract this nuanced erlay specific logic away from net processing, even if its per-peer. The txrequest module is a good example for this, eg. `PeerInfo` struct and how its applied within the module to make choices, and the decisions are surfaced to `net_processing`. ",

Even if reconciliation roles are decided in function of our peer selection, they should be clearly dissociated as orthogonal.\r\n\r\nACK, although I think \"inbound\" is not initiated, but it's accepted.",
