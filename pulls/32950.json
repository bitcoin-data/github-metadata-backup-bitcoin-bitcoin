    "body": "Fixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32173\r\n\r\neven though we have a distinction between `BLOCK_FAILED_VALID` and `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` in the codebase,\r\nwe don't use it for anything. Whenever we check for BlockStatus, we use `BLOCK_FAILED_MASK` which encompasses both of them.\r\n\r\nSince there is no functional difference between `BLOCK_FAILED_VALID` and `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` and it's added\r\ncode complexity to correctly categorise them (ex: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31405#discussion_r1914366243, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16856#issuecomment-565506585), we could just remove it.\r\n\r\nLooking for conceptual feedback on whether it's better to improve handling of `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` in the codebase or remove `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD`.\r\n\r\nOf less relevance, but it would also fix a `reconsiderblock` crash that could happen in the situation mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32173#issuecomment-2767030982\r\n\r\nSimilar attempt in the past in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16856#issuecomment-568073859",

Do we have strong guarantees that it's impossible that:\r\n\r\n> A is marked BLOCK_FAILED_VALID\r\n> B is marked BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD\r\n> C is not marked invalid\r\n\r\nI don't think this would happen naturally. If we receive a block header which is based on top of an invalid block header in our block index, `AcceptBlockHeader` would mark it as invalid.\r\n\r\nMaybe some rare scenario where devs were playing with `invalidateblock` RPC?\r\n- and `invalidateblock` RPC got interrupted before it could finish marking all descendant blocks as invalid\r\n- and they happened to be restarting their node with this commit haha\r\n\r\nStill not an issue since we update the invalidity flags during restart in `LoadBlockIndex`.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps useful to write a test around this?\r\n\r\nmakes sense to test this migration behaviour. done in cfadc80.",
