    "body": "This is work from Jeremy Rubin integrated into our buildsystem. It allows for rust code to be used directly inside of Bitcoin Core. In its current form, it demonstrates calling a single hello_world function from rust code.\r\n\r\nThis is not intended to be merged as-is, but instead to serve as a reference for anyone who might be interested in trying out some rust code inside of Bitcoin Core. I have no idea what works. I have lots of questions about debugging, threading, etc. But instead of trying to hack and document how things work, we thought it'd be fun for everyone to be able to poke at it and scratch our heads together :). If something interesting comes out of it, a discussion about merging can happen then.\r\n\r\nIt is surprisingly functional. The rust tools are impeccable. I would've thought this would be a project that would take months/years, but the rust devs have done such a good job that mostly everything already just works. The gitian descriptors have been modified to actually incorporate working rust code. All of our currently supported platforms seem to already work (even macOS cross!) with the exception of 32bit windows and ancient linux distros. The specific issues are documented in the gitian descriptors. For now, Gitian needs net access and a larger disk volume, but those are both very temporary issues\r\n\r\nWhy rust? I don't know. Maybe not. But I think it's a fair assumption to say that Rust code will eventually end up in Bitcoin Core as the result of adding a new dependency. Adoption is happing quickly. So, I think it prudent to look ahead and not only be prepared, but actively help usher it in. Already I have a few things that I would like to work on and upstream to rust-lang to make our integration nicer, and I assume that more will be uncovered as it actually gets used.\r\n\r\nAnybody have any fun ideas?",

      "body": "@MarcoFalke As noted in the summary, for now, gitian requires net access to download the dependencies. That will be fixed before merge.\r\n\r\nAlso, It requires a toolchain tarball that hasn't been trimmed, so it's very large. That means that the size of the gitian disk needs to be increased:\r\n```bash\r\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=base-bionic-amd64 bs=1k seek=20480k count=1\r\n```\r\nAfaik that won't affect builds in any other way, but be sure to make a backup to be safe.\r\n\r\nThe toolchain package can be created by running this script: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15798/files#diff-8acecf4a86a4f206bddfcf142d451a05",

          "body": "This is based on #15798.\r\n\r\nI'm increasingly worried about censorship and other attacks in the P2P network (see, eg, https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1160620919775211520). While obviously making the net_processing p2p implementation more robust should be the focus (eg #15759), adding more redundancy in every way is also key. To avoid needless review burden on such systems, I think rust is an ideal candidate: it is wholly optional so we don't just right to requiring Rust for Bitcoin Core, but building with it still provides real benefit, plus we can use compile-time checks to catch any overflows and memory corruption bugs to reduce review burden.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a simple API for Rust code to fetch headers and blocks and then implements a sample client that can sync the chain using a REST endpoint. As a demo, I provide a rest endpoint over cloudflare at http://cloudflare.deanonymizingseed.com/rest/ so you should be able to fully sync the chain (albeit very slowly) with bitcoind -blockfetchrest=http://cloudflare.deanonymizingseed.com/rest/ -connect=0\r\n\r\nThere's a few things to do before this is mergable, but I'd like feedback on the idea, and would like to also have a fully parallel, in rust, P2P net layer that is similarly simple and provides a nice redundant implementation in the future.",

          "body": "Moving the discussion from #15798 here, as it makes more sense to have it in an issue instead of a PR. #15798 no longer reflects the current proposed Rust changes, and Rust related work is now happening across multiple others.\r\n\r\n[Corys](https://github.com/theuni/) thoughts / introduction from #15798:\r\n\r\n> This is not intended to be merged as-is, but instead to serve as a reference for anyone who might be interested in trying out some rust code inside of Bitcoin Core. I have no idea what works. I have lots of questions about debugging, threading, etc. But instead of trying to hack and document how things work, we thought it'd be fun for everyone to be able to poke at it and scratch our heads together :). If something interesting comes out of it, a discussion about merging can happen then.\r\n\r\n> It is surprisingly functional. The rust tools are impeccable. I would've thought this would be a project that would take months/years, but the rust devs have done such a good job that mostly everything already just works. The gitian descriptors have been modified to actually incorporate working rust code. All of our currently supported platforms seem to already work (even macOS cross!) with the exception of 32bit windows and ancient linux distros. The specific issues are documented in the gitian descriptors. For now, Gitian needs net access and a larger disk volume, but those are both very temporary issues\r\n\r\n> Why rust? I don't know. Maybe not. But I think it's a fair assumption to say that Rust code will eventually end up in Bitcoin Core as the result of adding a new dependency. Adoption is happing quickly. So, I think it prudent to look ahead and not only be prepared, but actively help usher it in. Already I have a few things that I would like to work on and upstream to rust-lang to make our integration nicer, and I assume that more will be uncovered as it actually gets used.\r\n\r\n> Anybody have any fun ideas?\r\n\r\nThere's still discussion to be had / documentation to be added around various Rust related decisions, such as:\r\n* Whether to use/require the `2015` or `2018` Editions.\r\n* A minimum required version of the language.\r\n* How failures in the Rust code are (expected to be) handled by the c++ code.\r\n\r\nAs well as higher level discussions around how far we might take the Rust integration/re-writing of certain parts of the code, and the complexities that could introduce in regards which contributors can/can't write/review Rust, or have more/less experience with the language compared to `C++` etc.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd like to think that we'll have some off-by-default Rust as part of the Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 release; and I think something like #16834 might be a good first approach. Regardless of approach, the idea of using Rust inside Bitcoin Core seems to resonate with some of the (still limited set) of other contributors I've discussed it with.\r\n\r\n#### Using `rustc` directly instead of Cargo\r\nThe initial Rust [integration PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15798) used [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo) for managing compiling, dependencies etc. Since then, the Rust changes have been refactored to remove the `cbindgen` dependency and drop any usage of Cargo altogether, in favour of using [`rustc` directly](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16834/files#diff-480477e89f9b6ddafb30c4383dcdd705R371).\r\n\r\nSee also the recent [Security advisory for Cargo](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/09/30/Security-advisory-for-cargo.html).\r\n\r\n#### Related PRs\r\n[Fetch Headers over DNS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16834)\r\n[Rust-based Backup over-REST block downloader](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16762)\r\n[Add Parallel P2P Client in Rust](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17376)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Related Reading\r\n[Bootstrapping Rust using Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2018/bootstrapping-rust/)",
