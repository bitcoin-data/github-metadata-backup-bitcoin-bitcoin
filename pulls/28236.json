    "body": "This PR adds fuzz coverage for `wallet/spend`.\r\n\r\nMotivation: Issue [27272](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27272#issue-1628327906)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Fuzz coverage to the whole concept of Creating a New Transaction as well as other sections of the Spend file.  Because `CreateTransaction` is one of the most frequently used functions in the wallet codebase, merging this PR will significantly improve the wallet codebase's Fuzz testing!\r\n\r\nI also used the `Singleton Class` concept for creating Wallet instances because it assures that only one instance of it is created during all Fuzz runs, which significantly boosts the file's `exec/sec`.\r\n",

It provides read only access to a BDB file, and can therefore be used as a read only database backend for wallets. This will be used for dumping legacy wallet records and migrating legacy wallets without the need for BDB itself.\r\n\r\nWallettool's `dump` command is changed to use `BerkeleyRODatabase` instead of `BerkeleyDatabase` (and `CWallet` itself) to demonstrate that this parser works and to test it against the existing wallettool functional tests.",

          "body": "Currently migrating to descriptor wallets requires having BDB available. In order to remove BDB from the project, we need to be able to do these migrations without BDB. This PR adds `BerkeleyRODatabase` which is an independent implementation of a BDB file parser. It can be used to read uncorrupted BDB files and extract all of their records. This is used for both the wallettool's `dump` command, and `migratewallet`.\r\n\r\nBased on #26606 ",

In the recent push, I've addressed most of your reviews.\r\n\r\n- `clang-format` to fix the lint's issue.\r\n- Changed `PickValueFromArray` to the `PickValue` approach.\r\n- Fixed one grammar mistake.\r\n\r\nThis [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28236#discussion_r1286425941) is really interesting, but I'm not sure whether the `non-determinism` in this case might pose a significant issue or not.\r\nSo, I'll wait for more people to give their thoughts on this and we can write a new `CreateSyncedWallet` specific for Fuzzing purposes if felt necessary.\r\n",

Migration of legacy wallets uses the independent BDB parser and a minimal `LegacyDataSPKM` that allows the legacy data to be loaded so that the migration can be completed.\r\n\r\nAll tests which tested legacy wallet behavior have been removed. The `--descriptors` and `--legacy-wallet` options are removed from the functional tests.\r\n\r\nBDB has been removed as a dependency and documentation have been updated to reflect that.\r\n\r\nDepends on #26596",

Are you suggesting that I reconsider what I want to increase coverage of in this file?\r\n\r\nAlso, I have a question about the blue lines in the coverage reports. Do they represent the line coverage of the code during fuzzing? For instance, if these functions are encountered in the process of running any fuzz file, the fuzz coverage will display them in blue. If I'm understanding this correctly, wouldn't it still make sense to have a separate fuzz file for `Creating Transaction` so that we can explore more test cases and code flows? These might not be tested if the coverage is coming from another fuzz file designed for a different purpose or codebase.\r\n\r\n https://maflcko.github.io/b-c-cov/fuzz.coverage/src/wallet/spend.cpp.gcov.html",

The goal of this issue is to actively track current work and work that needs to be done to improve fuzz coverage for the wallet.\r\n\r\n## Open PRs / Ready to review\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29694\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28236\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28074\r\n\r\n## Current wallet targets\r\n\r\nWe currently have 6 specific targets for wallet, which cover:\r\n\r\n- Fees (`wallet/fees.cpp`)\r\n- Coin selection\r\n- ScriptPubKeyManager (descriptor)\r\n- Coin control (`CCoinControl`)\r\n- Notifications\r\n- ISO8601 parser\r\n\r\n## Nice to have\r\n\r\n- [ ] Feebumper target\r\n- [ ] More coverage for `CWallet` stuff\r\n- [ ] Wallet transaction target\r\n- [ ] Wallet receive target\r\n\r\n## Won't/Can't cover\r\n\r\n### Legacy wallet removal\r\n\r\nThe goal is to remove legacy wallets and migrate them to descriptor ones. There is an open issue with a proposed timeline for Legacy Wallet and BDB removal (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20160). For this reason, we do not aim to increase fuzz coverage for legacy stuff. See that the `scriptpubkeyman` target only uses descriptor ones.\r\n\r\n### External signer\r\n\r\nI do believe we can't have fuzz coverage for external signer code.\r\n\r\n## Performance and determinism\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some aspects of the wallet may affect the fuzzing performance.  E.g.:\r\n\r\n- `SetupDescriptorScriptPubKeyMans` (it might also be non-deterministic due to key generation)\r\n- Wallet encryption\r\n- Wallet migration (there is a PR improving it - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28574)\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nAny ideas about it or PRs to add let me know.",
