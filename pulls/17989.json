    "body": "Add fuzzing harness for `ProcessMessage(...)`. Enables high-level fuzzing of the P2P layer.\r\n\r\nAll code paths reachable from this fuzzer can be assumed to be reachable for an untrusted peer.\r\n\r\nSeeded from thin air (an empty corpus) this fuzzer reaches roughly 20 000 lines of code.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make distclean\r\n$ ./autogen.sh\r\n$ CC=clang CXX=clang++ ./configure --enable-fuzz \\\r\n      --with-sanitizers=address,fuzzer,undefined\r\n$ make\r\n$ src/test/fuzz/process_message\r\n…\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorth noting about this fuzzing harness:\r\n* To achieve a reasonable number of executions per seconds the state of the fuzzer is unfortunately not entirely reset between `test_one_input` calls. The set-up (`FuzzingSetup` ctor) and tear-down (`~FuzzingSetup`) work is simply too costly to be run on every iteration. There is a trade-off to handle here between a.) achieving high executions/second and b.) giving the fuzzer a totally blank slate for each call. Please let me know if you have any suggestion on how to improve this situation while maintaining >1000 executions/second. \r\n* To achieve optimal results when using coverage-guided fuzzing I've chosen to create one specialised fuzzing binary per message type (`process_message_addr`, `process_message_block`, `process_message_blocktxn `, etc.) and one general fuzzing binary (`process_message`) which handles all messages types. The latter general fuzzer can be seeded with inputs generated by the former specialised fuzzers.\r\n\r\nHappy fuzzing friends!",

      "body": "> Concept ACK. Is there a reason to both allow all message types and then add some fuzzers that only allow one message type?\r\n\r\nYes there is :)\r\n\r\n1. The reason to allow all message types in one of the fuzzers: this allows auto-detection and thus fuzzing of newly introduced messages types without updating the fuzzer. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-596803815 for a real-world example of that :)\r\n\r\n2. The reason to have also have per-message-type fuzzers is largely for the same reason that we have one fuzzing binary per deserialization: to make it relatively easier for coverage guided fuzzers to reach deep. See sipa's rationale [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11045#issuecomment-323108021) and kcc's confirmation [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11045#issuecomment-323198955).

Assuming 60 processes or so, 32 bits of randomness should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nOh, true. I experimented with having the fuzzing setup non-global to start with (one setup per `test_one_input`). That's probably when `FastRandomContext().rand64()` was thought to be needed IIRC.\r\n\r\nI'll try your patch: if we can get it working with `RegTestingSetup` then that's great :)",
