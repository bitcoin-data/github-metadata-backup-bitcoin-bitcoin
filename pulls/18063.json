    "body": "This PR contains two refactors to the UpdateForDescendants method that could be stand alone, but I think are easiest to review together. This is follow up work from #17925 and a related to the work laid out in #17268.\r\n\r\nThe first change refactors UpdateForDescendants to use Epochs instead of sets to de-duplicate traversal, and replaces the cache entries with a vector instead of a set. This is a straightforward win. The algorithm is a bit clever so as not to require two separate vectors for txiters that need expanding and txiters that have already been processed, but I think it's relatively easy to reason about.\r\n\r\nThe second change removes the cache altogether, as it is not needed.\r\n\r\nThe cache was an optimization to limit re-traversal in UpdateForDescendants. But because we know that descendants limit limits the total number of descendants, this actually doesn't help that much. There are some common cases where having a CacheMap *might* be faster, but an adversary can trivially construct a worst-case example that causes equal behavior with or without a cachemap. For example, a transaction with N/2 children which each have N/2 outputs that get spent by N/2 grandchildren will cause the parent to iterate over N^2 entries with or without CacheMap. Post Epochs, UpdateForDescendants is sufficiently cheap such that the cachemap is just extra memory overhead.\r\n\r\nThis extra memory overhead isn't free, and my expectation is that getting rid of it should be faster in general. In an average case, we might expect not to have very deep long chains so we're allocating memory for little benefit.\r\n\r\nIt could be the case that the first commit causes a larger speed-up, because the upgraded cache vectors are much more efficient to build and iterate over. Then by removing them, we need to now go back to a traversal of std::sets for the MemPool children (before the first commit these cache lines were std::sets which are slow to iterate). However, we also eliminate the cache entry lookups, which are also slow, and get rid of a bunch of allocation. My guess is that it \"comes out in the wash\", and the new algorithm after both patches is superior to both the previous algorithm and the algorithm after only the first patch. The descendants limit comes into play helping feel comfortable with this: we know that the `vecEntries stage` can be no larger than the desendants limit (25), so we can bound how much traversals we'd do at 25*24.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a future work, the stage can become a cached epoch member (since we know we have the lock), so that this function does not need to allocate on each call, but this seemed like a minor improvement and invites some more discussion on if pre-allocating these scratchpads is a good idea.",

      "body": "> The cache was an optimization to limit re-traversal in UpdateForDescendants. But because we know that descendants limit limits the total number of descendants, this actually doesn't help that much. There are some common cases where having a CacheMap might be faster, but an adversary can trivially construct a worst-case example that causes equal behavior with or without a cachemap. For example, a transaction with N/2 children which each have N/2 outputs that get spent by N/2 grandchildren will cause the parent to iterate over N^2 entries with or without CacheMap. Post Epochs, UpdateForDescendants is sufficiently cheap such that the cachemap is just extra memory overhead.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about this again, trying to remember the motivation here.  I think the concern is that when you're adding back transactions from a block, you have no guarantees for what kinds of chains could exist in that block.  For instance, maybe you have a block with 4000 transactions that consist of each transaction being a child of the one preceding it?  In that situation, it seems like caching the results as you go could be faster than rewalking each time.\r\n\r\nI can try to come up with some adversarial examples and benchmark them.  It's not totally obvious what to be optimizing for; I imagine that in the common case having no cache is best, but limiting worst-case behavior might be the better metric here (so that a reorg-capable-attacker isn't sidelining honest hashpower through tricks like this).",

      "body": "So I think what's confusing about it is that it does \"hinder\" one attacker, but opens up a different attacker. I think what's worse is that with this redress, we have gone from a small processing time issue (which is sad) to a memory attack (which can cause nodes to OOM). Therefore IMO it's not worthwhile.\r\n\r\nIt's also unclear who is getting walked in this case to me -- are we walking things that are still in the MemPool or things that came from the block?\r\n\r\nIn either case, the argument is roughly the same:\r\n\r\nSuppose I have N/2 direct children with N/2 outputs and N/2 grandchildren with N/2 inputs.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/886523/74191765-0c1f0e80-4c09-11ea-849d-ee709f0bb8d3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the traversal is equal or better for every node except node -1. However, if we use a node 17 instead of node -1:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/886523/74191796-150fe000-4c09-11ea-88c9-4d587483de31.png)\r\n\r\nWhat this shows us is the cache working to keep the runtimes consistent on this pattern, but that uncached isn't *substantially* worse. If you look at these in Big-O, they come out to the same polynomial, so it's really about the constants.\r\n\r\nLet's look at another example.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/886523/74192668-cf541700-4c0a-11ea-8d9a-37714ae3bbdd.png)\r\n\r\nSo by doing a simple linear chain, our cache can now use O(N^2) memory. Here the caching is worthless, except if it is faster to traverse the cache data structure than the MempoolChildren. For context if the smallest transaction is 61 bytes...\r\n\r\n(1mb / 61 bytes)**2 * 8 bytes = 2 GB.\r\n\r\nThis sort of attack is more concerning than the fan out one above, because the fan in/out inputs and outputs are somewhat  \"self limiting\", e.g.:\r\n\r\nmaximize n*m subject to (61 + n*9) + (61 + n * 41 + m * 9) + (61 + m * 41) < 1e6\r\n\r\nm, n = 10000, 10000\r\n\r\nThen we have n caches of size m, or 800 MB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worst case complexity for non-cached is probably combo-ing a one in one out with a fanned out anchor. Suppose we have N/2 for a chain, and then N/2 for fan out. With or without caching, you end up with something that is N^3 (with caching: N/2 iterations over a N^2 cache, without caching: N/2 iterations over a N^2 subtree).",

      "message": "Remove CacheMap from mempool UpdateForDescendants. CacheMap was an optimization to limit re-traversal in UpdateForDescendants. But because we know that descendants limit limits the total number of descendants, this actually doesn't help that much. There are some common cases where having a CacheMap might be faster, but an adversary can trivially construct a worst-case example that causes equal behavior with or without a cachemap. For example, a transaction with N/2 children which each have N/2 outputs that get spent by N/2 grandchildren will cause the parent to iterate over N^2 entries with or without CacheMap. Post Epochs, UpdateForDescendants is sufficiently cheap such that the cachemap is just extra memory overhead.",

The algorithm is a bit clever so as not to require two separate vectors for txiters that need expanding and txiters that have already been processed, but I think it's relatively easy to reason about.\r\n\r\nextracted from #18063 as a standalone because it turns out the DoS issues with this code perhaps merit more extensive review http://gnusha.org/bitcoin-core-dev/2020-02-11.log.

This patch set is an attempt to switch to using weight units in place of virtual bytes internally for a more accurate feerate computation, while leaving intact the vbyte interface.\r\n\r\nThere is, I think, a big cleanup needed (for example renaming feerate constants as `xx_FEERATE` would really improve readability) but I wanted to keep changes as minimal as possible.\r\n\r\n Fixes #13283.",

The overall change here should be easier to review as well.\r\n\r\nRefactors UpdateForDescendants to use Epochs instead of sets to de-duplicate traversal, and replaces the cache entries with a vector instead of a set. This is a straightforward win. The algorithm is a bit clever so as not to require two separate vectors for txiters that need expanding and txiters that have already been processed, but I think it's relatively easy to reason about.\r\n\r\nThis is extracted from #18063 as a standalone because it turns out the DoS issues with this code perhaps merit more extensive review http://gnusha.org/bitcoin-core-dev/2020-02-11.log. That PR will stay open for review, but this PR is designed as an \"obviously better\" win that can be merged now to keep progress up on the mempool project.\r\n\r\nsdaftuar can you re-run your bench from #18120?",
