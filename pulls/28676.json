    "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [x] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [x] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts. Is this a problem?",

      "body": "I was wondering if we can drop RBF rule 5 (in a followup), but I'm guessing not really. My initial thinking was the cluster limit could be used instead. But `CalculateMiningScoreOfReplacementTx` only checks that the _new_ cluster doesn't get too big.\r\n\r\nBut does the new cluster system make it less of a burden to have large numbers of transactions appear and disappear from the mempool?\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nI'm also trying to understand if dropping the [CPFP carveout](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp-carve-out/) is fine. The original scenario described on the [mailistlist](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-November/016518.html):\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nTX_important\r\n  * output Alice <- child_a_1 <- child_a_2 <- … -< child_a_25\r\n                   (^ intentionally low fees so it doesn't confirm before timeout)\r\n  * output Bob: child_b_1\r\n                ^ high fee\r\n```\r\n  \r\nThe carveout rule allows Bob's `child_b_1`, despite Alice having used up the 25 ancestor limit for TX_important. And alice can't use the carveout to just add child_a_26, because child_26 has more than one unconfirmed ancestor.\r\n\r\nSo what happens in the cluster world?\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, let's set `-limitclustercount` to 26 (the default is 100 in this PR). Without the CPFP carveout, can Bob still insert `child_b_1`?\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that he can't, because `ClusterSizeChecks` will fail.\r\n\r\nInstead of failing, can we check if it's possible to evict the lowest value chunk? Though it introduces an implicit RBF-like mechanism… If it were possible, then `child_a_25` would be evicted from the cluster as long as it has a longer fee rate than `child_b_1`.\r\n\r\nAlice might make sure that the fee rates of `child_a_1` … `child_a_25` increase such that there's only one chunk. That just requires Bob to use a higher fee rate.",

      "body": "In the context of Stratum v2 #29432 I'm looking for a more efficient way to decide when to generate a new block template.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation looks at the mempool's `GetTransactionsUpdated()` every `-sv2interval` seconds. If there was any update, it calls `CreateNewBlock()` on `BlockAssembler`. It then checks if fees increased by at least `-sv2feedelta` since the last template and if so, pushes it to connected clients.\r\n\r\n`GetTransactionsUpdated()` changes all the time, especially with a big mempool, so not that useful of a filter. I'd like something like `GetFeeEstimateAtTop(size vbytes=4000000)`. Would it be easy to keep track of that (approximate) number every time something is added or removed from the mempool?\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd like to change the meaning of `-sv2interval` from \"check every n seconds and push update if needed\" to \"push better templates immediately, but wait least n seconds between them\".",

Without knowing exactly what was happening here: in the current draft of the PR, the number of iterations in an optimal sort is related to the number of topologically valid orderings of the cluster (since we look at all topologically valid subsets each time we try to find the best candidate), so if there are clusters with similar topologies, you might expect to see the same number of iterations needed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the current draft, successful RBF candidates cause us to relinearize things twice: once to construct the feerate diagram, and once again when the new transaction is added to the mempool.  The intention is to eliminate the  linearizations upon acceptance to the mempool from taking place if they were already done as part of the RBF calculation (the design of the TxGraph was done with this in mind), but that is not yet implemented.  (In the example you pasted, I noticed there are 4 linearizations happening at the same millisecond, so I wonder if RBF may also be involved.)",

      "body": "Thanks @glozow for the test improvements.  I've also made a change to an RBF limit that I think is worth mentioning.  Rather than limit the number of direct conflicts that a transaction can have, I've now implemented the limit to be on the number of distinct clusters that the conflicts of a transaction belong to.\r\n\r\nThe idea is still to create some bound on the amount of CPU we might spend linearizing clusters and doing feerate diagram checks when processing a single transaction.  Limiting the number of conflicting clusters (at 100 for now) should be sufficient to achieve that.  I want to point out that we might linearize more than 100 clusters as a result of a replacement (because removing conflicts might cause clusters to split), but since linearizing small clusters is generally much less work than linearizing big clusters, I don't think this distinction materially affects the way we understand the implied CPU bound.",

However, all the bench sanity checks are run in a single process, so this is likely unrelated to this pull request. Discussion can be done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32770.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the timeout can be ignored. If you want to temporarily raise it, you can use:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/ci/test/00_setup_env.sh\r\n+++ b/ci/test/00_setup_env.sh\r\n-export TEST_RUNNER_TIMEOUT_FACTOR=${TEST_RUNNER_TIMEOUT_FACTOR:-40}\r\n+export TEST_RUNNER_TIMEOUT_FACTOR=${TEST_RUNNER_TIMEOUT_FACTOR:-80}\r\n```\r\n\r\nas a separate commit, so that it can be reverted in the future, once https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32770 is fixed.",

      "body": "Approach ACK \r\n\r\nI ran this branch for a while on mainnet and have not noticed any issue, importing of mempool saved before cluster succeeded in multiple runs.\r\n\r\n> Would it be a good idea to split this PR into a main PR with Cluster Implementation + Cleanups + Docs and Tests, then a followups PR with Optimizations and more cleanups? Goal is to get everything in v31, but this might help with reducing the size of the main PR and make it easier to punt cleanup-related comments to later.\r\n\r\nI've spent some time trying to understand the approach and changes in this PR, the changes in this PR can be categorized into\r\n\r\n**Main Changes**\r\n\r\n* Changes to CTxMemPoolEntry to be a derived class of txgraph::ref.\r\n* Changes to the mempool to be a wrapper around tx graph, making changeset create staging and commit or discard it depending on whether the mempool fee rate diagram is improved,  update the txgraph  for all addition, removals and accessing etc.\r\n* Updates to RBF to use the fee rate diagram.\r\n* Changes to validation ( replacement check is updated to fee rate diagram, carveouts are pruned, enforcing cluster size limits instead of ancestor or descendant size limits).\r\n* Addition of cluster size limits as a startup option.\r\n* Updating interfacess to use to check cluster limits instead of ancestor limt and updates to use new mempool methods.\r\n* Updating the blockassembler to use the new block builder for selection to block template\r\n* TRUC policy is updated use the new mempool interface.\r\n* Benchmarking changes.\r\n*  Unit Test changes\r\n*  RBF carveout tests deletion.\r\n*  Package one-more functional test is pruned.\r\n*  Package RBF updates to use cluster size as max conflicts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**RPC changes**\r\n* Mempool RPC: addition of cluster description, limits, and chunk data to mempool RPCs and a new the fee rate diagram RPC.\r\n\r\n**Unit Test Improvements**\r\n*lots of tests were touched because AddToMempool was changed to `TryAddToMempool`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Functional tests**\r\n* Addition of mempool cluster tests for testing limits and accessors.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese changes can all be in separate PR's but not really necessary , I think it logically flow well and can be reviewed as a single PR as well.\r\n",

For each three numbers were computed:\r\n* (a) the fees gathered by the `getblocktemplate` template itself.\r\n* (b) the fees found using the same mempool, using a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal template restricted to just cluster prefixes at chunk boundaries.\r\n* (c) a conservative overestimate, computed by eagerly filling the block with chunks until one does no longer fit, and then counting the remaining space at the feerate of that non-fitting chunk\r\n\r\nThe blue line below gives the histogram of the difference between (b) and (c), the green line gives the difference between (a) and (b), and purple is the difference between (a) and (c).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1280\" height=\"800\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00a7575c-bf28-48d1-81a0-c95fbd4297fa\" />\r\n",

This\n  means that the test is not performed at all in AcceptMultipleTransactions(),\n  but in package acceptance we already disallow RBF in situations where a\n  package transaction has in-mempool parents.\n\nAlso to ensure that all RBF validation logic is applied in both the single\ntransaction and multiple transaction cases, remove the optimization that skips\nthe PackageMempoolChecks() in the case of a single transaction being validated\nin AcceptMultipleTransactions().",

I think the requirement is a bound on the number of clusters that would have to be re-sorted in order to accept the new transaction.  We can approximate that as the number of clusters that would be non-empty as a result of removing all the conflicting transactions from the mempool, and only process replacements for which that is below some target.  \r\n\r\nThat would be a more complex logic though, so before implementing it I wanted to have some sense of whether we need to.  Has the historical 100-transaction-conflict limit been problematic for use cases in the past?  Note also that in the new code, we are calculating the number of conflicts exactly (the old code used an approximation, which could be gamed by an adversary).",

Adding a `CFeeRate::GetFeePerVSize()` should be sufficient.",

However, if there are conflicts for removal, then cluster size limits are checked within `ReplacementChecks()` anyway, so there's not really an issue, except that this slightly confusing and perhaps this relationship could be overlooked in the future if the behavior of `ReplacementChecks()` were modified.\r\n\r\nI think what I'll do is just move the ephemeral spends check down below this block of code.

As I was working on this, I was thinking about your comment above about reworking the TRUC checks to just grab the clusters it needs directly from txgraph.  The issue with that in the way our code works right now is that we can't fully realize our staging clusters until we've added all the transactions, applied dependencies, and staged all the RBF removals.\r\n\r\nIf we went ahead and imposed a topology requirement on transaction packages so that we know they're staged for addition in a topologically valid order, then we could do a bit better by applying dependencies as we go, so that we could try to look at staging clusters as we go as well.  However I think that is also confusing (in the same way that our existing validation logic is a bit confusing), compared with if we were able to stage all additions and removals up front, and then work on the resulting staging clusters.  Doing that would require a bigger overhaul of the logic in validation.cpp, which I didn't want to tackle just yet.  \r\n\r\nBut if anyone sees a clean way to do things that is better than what I'm proposing so far, please let me know.",
