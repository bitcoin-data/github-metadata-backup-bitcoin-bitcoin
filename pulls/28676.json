    "body": "This is a draft implementation of the cluster mempool design described in #27677.  I'm opening this as a draft PR now to share the branch I'm working on with others, so that we can start to think about in-progress projects (like package relay, package validation, and package rbf) in the context of this design.  Also, I can use some help from others for parts of this work, including the interaction between the mempool and the wallet, and also reworking some of our existing test cases to fit a cluster-mempool world.\r\n\r\nNote that the design of this implementation is subject to change as I continue to iterate on the code (to make the code more hygienic and robust, in particular). At this point though I think the performance is pretty reasonable and I'm not currently aware of any bugs.  There are some microbenchmarks added here, and some improved fuzz tests; it would be great if others ran both of those on their own hardware as well and reported back on any findings.\r\n\r\nThis branch implements the following observable behavior changes:\r\n\r\n- Maintains a partitioning of the mempool into connected clusters\r\n- Each cluster is sorted (\"linearized\") either using an optimal sort, or an ancestor-feerate-based one, depending on the size of the cluster (thanks to @sipa for this logic)\r\n- Transaction selection for mining is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- Mempool eviction is updated to use the cluster linearizations\r\n- The RBF rules are updated to drop the requirement that no new inputs are introduced, and to change the feerate requirement to instead check that the mining score of a replacement transaction exceed the mining score of the conflicted transactions\r\n- The CPFP carveout rule is eliminated (it doesn't make sense in a cluster-limited mempool)\r\n- The ancestor and descendant limits are no longer enforced.\r\n- New cluster count/cluster vsize limits are now enforced instead.\r\n\r\nSome less observable behavior changes:\r\n- The cached ancestor and descendant data are dropped from the mempool, along with the multi_index indices that were maintained to sort the mempool by ancestor and descendant feerates. For compatibility (eg with wallet behavior or RPCs exposing this), this information is now calculated dynamically instead.\r\n- The ancestor and descendant walking algorithms are now implemented using `epoch`s (resulting in a significant performance improvement, according to the benchmarks I've looked at)\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] More comparisons between this branch and master on historical data to compare validation speed (accepting loose transactions, processing RBF transactions, validating a block/postprocessing, updating the mempool for a reorg).\r\n- [x] More historical data analysis to try to evaluate the likely impact of setting the cluster size limits to varying values (to motivate what values we should ultimately pick). [DONE, see [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-into-the-effects-of-a-cluster-size-limited-mempool-in-2023/794/1)]\r\n- [ ] Updating wallet code to be cluster-aware (including mini_miner and coin selection)\r\n- [ ] Rework many of our functional tests to be cluster-aware\r\n- [ ] Figure out what package validation and package RBF rules should be in this design\r\n- [ ] Rework the `partially_downloaded_block` fuzz target to not add duplicate transactions to the mempool (#29990).\r\n- [ ] Update RBF logic to ensure that replacements always strictly improve the mempool.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we want to document our RBF policy (preserve historical references to BIP 125 or previous Bitcoin Core behaviors vs clean slate documentation?)\r\n\r\nFor discussion/feedback:\r\n\r\n - How significant is it to be dropping the CPFP carveout rule?  Does that affect how we will ultimately want to stage new mempool deployment?\r\n - How well do the proposed RBF rules meet everyone's use cases?\r\n - What design improvements can we make to the cluster tracking implementation?\r\n - The ZMQ callbacks that occur when a block is found will happen in a slightly different order, because we now will fully remove all transactions occurring in a block from the mempool before removing any conflicts.

      "body": "I was wondering if we can drop RBF rule 5 (in a followup), but I'm guessing not really. My initial thinking was the cluster limit could be used instead. But `CalculateMiningScoreOfReplacementTx` only checks that the _new_ cluster doesn't get too big.\r\n\r\nBut does the new cluster system make it less of a burden to have large numbers of transactions appear and disappear from the mempool?\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nI'm also trying to understand if dropping the [CPFP carveout](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp-carve-out/) is fine. The original scenario described on the [mailistlist](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-November/016518.html):\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nTX_important\r\n  * output Alice <- child_a_1 <- child_a_2 <- … -< child_a_25\r\n                   (^ intentionally low fees so it doesn't confirm before timeout)\r\n  * output Bob: child_b_1\r\n                ^ high fee\r\n```\r\n  \r\nThe carveout rule allows Bob's `child_b_1`, despite Alice having used up the 25 ancestor limit for TX_important. And alice can't use the carveout to just add child_a_26, because child_26 has more than one unconfirmed ancestor.\r\n\r\nSo what happens in the cluster world?\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, let's set `-limitclustercount` to 26 (the default is 100 in this PR). Without the CPFP carveout, can Bob still insert `child_b_1`?\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that he can't, because `ClusterSizeChecks` will fail.\r\n\r\nInstead of failing, can we check if it's possible to evict the lowest value chunk? Though it introduces an implicit RBF-like mechanism… If it were possible, then `child_a_25` would be evicted from the cluster as long as it has a longer fee rate than `child_b_1`.\r\n\r\nAlice might make sure that the fee rates of `child_a_1` … `child_a_25` increase such that there's only one chunk. That just requires Bob to use a higher fee rate.",

      "body": "In the context of Stratum v2 #29432 I'm looking for a more efficient way to decide when to generate a new block template.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation looks at the mempool's `GetTransactionsUpdated()` every `-sv2interval` seconds. If there was any update, it calls `CreateNewBlock()` on `BlockAssembler`. It then checks if fees increased by at least `-sv2feedelta` since the last template and if so, pushes it to connected clients.\r\n\r\n`GetTransactionsUpdated()` changes all the time, especially with a big mempool, so not that useful of a filter. I'd like something like `GetFeeEstimateAtTop(size vbytes=4000000)`. Would it be easy to keep track of that (approximate) number every time something is added or removed from the mempool?\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd like to change the meaning of `-sv2interval` from \"check every n seconds and push update if needed\" to \"push better templates immediately, but wait least n seconds between them\".",

I think the requirement is a bound on the number of clusters that would have to be re-sorted in order to accept the new transaction.  We can approximate that as the number of clusters that would be non-empty as a result of removing all the conflicting transactions from the mempool, and only process replacements for which that is below some target.  \r\n\r\nThat would be a more complex logic though, so before implementing it I wanted to have some sense of whether we need to.  Has the historical 100-transaction-conflict limit been problematic for use cases in the past?  Note also that in the new code, we are calculating the number of conflicts exactly (the old code used an approximation, which could be gamed by an adversary).",

The replacement transaction's feerate is greater than the feerates of all directly conflicting\n+5. The replacement transaction's mining score is greater than the mining score of all directly conflicting\n    transactions.\n \n-   *Rationale*: This rule was originally intended to ensure that the replacement transaction is\n-   preferable for block-inclusion, compared to what would be removed from the mempool. This rule\n-   predates ancestor feerate-based transaction selection.\n+   *Rationale*: Ensure that the new transaction is more appealing to mine than those being evicted.\n \n This set of rules is similar but distinct from BIP125.\n ",
