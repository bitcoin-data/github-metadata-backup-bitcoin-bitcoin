(although there will be a pull request coming shortly providing a command line flag should peer information for all txs be desired).\n\nAlso, free transactions are identifies in the output. Not particularly useful, but these may become a rare thing in the not too distant future.. maybe, maybe not.\n\nApologies for the txnode variable. The only other way was to change all the functions to allow it to be passed. I think this is the neatest and least intrusive way, and can't see any harm in it, but please correct me if I'm wrong here.\n",

I don't see a strong argument for filling debug.log with more bytes than needed to communicate what is happening. In fact, there's an argument that it doesn't need to be human readable at all, but then that would require additional tools to translate it into something human readable. This patch was an attempt at a convenient in-between between excess data, but keeping it human readable/understandable, and including information that's useful (e.g. the hash, rather than superfluous static bytes).\n",
