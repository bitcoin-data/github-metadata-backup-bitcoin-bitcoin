This has a nice side effect, namely that a more recent version of shellcheck can be used. The runtime of the lint step is not affected to much by it (it's still around 1 minute as it was before).\r\n\r\nThe newer shellcheck also comes with more lint rules of which I disabled some as I did not want to touch too much stuff in this single pull request, which is primarily about a reorganization of the travis build.",
