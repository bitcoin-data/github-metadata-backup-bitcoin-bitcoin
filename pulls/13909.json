In no other project ever I had to defend the notion that generally globals should be avoided when possible. It is disappointing to see that not only people don't want the pseudo-global Params() to disappear but people also embrace it and undo previous changes towards making it disappear. It seems the same love exists at least for global gArgs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
