    "body": "This PR cleans up the wallet upgrade mechanism a bit, fixes some probably bugs, and adds more test cases.\r\n\r\nThe `nWalletMaxVersion` member variable has been removed as it made `CanSupportFeature` unintuitive and was causing a couple of bugs. The reason this was introduced originally was to allow a wallet upgrade to only occur when the new feature is first used. While this makes sense for the old `-upgradewallet` option, for an RPC, this does not quite make sense. It's more intuitive for an upgrade to occur if possible if the `upgradewallet` RPC is used as that's an explicit request to upgrade a particular wallet to a newer version. `nWalletMaxVersion` was only relevant for upgrades to `FEATURE_WALLETCRYPT` and `FEATURE_COMPRPUBKEY` both of which are incredibly old features. So for such wallets, the behavior of `upgradewallet` will be that the feature is enabled immediately without the wallet needing to be encrypted at that time (note that `FEATURE_WALLETCRYPT` indicates support for encryption, not that the wallet is encrypted) or for a new key to be generated.\r\n\r\n`CanSupportFeature` would previously indicate whether we could upgrade to `nWalletMaxVersion` not just whether the current wallet version supported a feature. While this property was being used to determine whether we should upgrade to HD and HD chain split, it was also causing a few bugs. Determining whether we should upgrade to HD or HD chain split is resolved by passing into `ScriptPubKeyMan::Upgrade` the version we are upgrading to and checking against that. By removing `nWalletMaxVersion` we also fix a bug where you could upgrade to HD chain split without the pre-split keypool.\r\n\r\n`nWalletMaxVersion` was also the version that was being reported by `getwalletinfo` which meant that the version reported was not always consistent across restarts as it depended on whether `upgradewallet` was used. Additionally to make the wallet versions consistent with actually supported versions, instead of just setting the wallet version to whatever is given to `upgradewallet`, we normalize the version number to the closest supported version number. For example, if given 150000, we would store and report 139900.\r\n\r\nAnother bug where CHDChain was not being upgraded to the version supporting HD chain split is also fixed by this PR.\r\n\r\nLastly several more tests have been added. Some refactoring to the test was made to make these tests easier. These tests check specific upgrading scenarios, such as from non-HD (version 60000) to HD to pre-split keypool. Although not specifically related to `upgradewallet`, `UpgradeKeyMetadata` is now being tested too.\r\n\r\nPart of the new tests is checking that the wallet files are identical before and after failed upgrades. To facilitate this, a utility function `sha256sum_file` has been added. Another part of the tests is to examine the wallet file itself to ensure that the records in the wallet.dat file have been correctly modified. So a new `bdb.py` module has been added to deserialize the BDB db of the wallet.dat file. This format isn't explicitly documented anywhere, but the code and comments in BDB's source code in file `dbinc/db_page.h` describe it. This module just dumps all of the fields into a dict.",

          "title": "wallet: Refactor the classes in wallet/db.{cpp/h}",
          "body": "The data storage layer of the wallet is fairly complicated and not well encapsulated or modularized. This makes it difficult for us to introduce new data storage methods. So this PR refactors it such that there is a clear way to introduce other storage options. This is also intended to clean up the logic of the database layer so that it is easier to follow and reason about.\r\n\r\nIn the database, there are 3 classes: `BerkeleyBatch`, `BerkeleyDatabase`, and `BerkeleyEnvironment`. `BerkeleyDatabase` is typenamed to `WalletDatabase`. The goal is to introduce two abstract classes: `WalletDatabase` and `DatabaseBatch`. These will be implemented by `BerkeleyDatabase` and `BerkeleyBatch`. This abstract classes can be inherited by other storage methods. All of the database specific things should be hidden in those classes.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we move the database handling things in `BerkeleyBatch` and turn it purely into a data accessor for the `BerkeleyDatabase`. Particularly, various static functions that operated on a `BerkeleyDatabase` are changed to be member functions of `BerkeleyDatabase`. `Read`, `Write`, `Erase`, and `Exists` are refactored to have separate functions that can be overridden by other classes. Instead of `GetCursor` returning a BDB specific `Dbc` object, new `CreateCursor` and `CloseCursor` functions are added and the cursor is handled internally within the `BerkeleyBatch`. We are then able to introduce the `DatabaseBatch` abstract class.\r\n\r\nFunctionality is further moved out of `BerkeleyBatch` into `BerkeleyDatabase`. Notably the `Db` handle creation is moved from `BerkeleyBatch`'s constructor and to a new `Open` function in `BerkeleyDatabase`. `BerkeleyDatabase` will also handle closing with a new `Close` function instead of having this be part of `Flush`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the existence of `BerkeleyEnvironment` is hidden inside of `BerkeleyDatabase`. `mapFileUseCount` is removed. Instead `WalletDatabase` will track it's use count with `m_refcount`. This is incremented by newly introduced `AddRef` and `RemoveRef` functions. `m_refcount` is used to ensure that the database and environment are not closed while the database may still be in use.\r\n\r\nInstead of each `BerkeleyEnvironment` tracking the fileids of the databases in that environment, a global map `g_fileids` is used. Since we were already going through every open fileid for the uniqeness check, it doesn't matter what `BerkeleyEnvironment` has a database with a particular fileid. All we care about is that there is a database in any of the environments that has the same fileid of the database that is currently being opened.\r\n\r\nLastly, `BerkeleyBatch, `BerkeleyDatabase`, and `BerkeleyEnvironment` are moved into new files `wallet/bdb.{cpp/h}`. `WalletDatabase` and `DatabaseBatch` are in `wallet/db.{cpp/h}`. This just gives better organization of the code so they aren't all mixed together.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI've started breaking this down into separate PRs. Some of the simpler stuff is moved up to the front so they can be merged first.\r\n\r\n* [x] Mostly simple moveonly things: #19290\r\n  * walletdb: Make SpliWalletFilePath non-static\r\n  * walletdb: Add IsBDBWalletLoaded to look for BDB wallets specifically\r\n  * walletdb: move IsWalletLoaded to walletdb.cpp\r\n  * walletdb: moveonly: Move BerkeleyBatch Cursor and Txn funcs to cpp\r\n  * walletdb: Move BDB specific things into bdb.{cpp/h}\r\n\r\nThese PRs are independent of each other and can be merged out of order after #19290 is merged\r\n* [x] Refactor Read, Write, Erase, Exists: #19292\r\n  * walletdb: refactor Read, Write, Erase, and Exists into non-template func\r\n* [x] Handle cursor internally: #19308\r\n  * walletdb: Handle cursor internally\r\n* [x] Make Create, CreateMock, and CreateDummy standalone: #19310\r\n  * Add Create*WalletDatabase functions\r\n  * scripted-diff: Replace WalletDatabase::Create* with CreateWalletDatabase\r\n  * Remove WalletDatabase::Create, CreateMock, and CreateDummy\r\n* [x] Move BerkeleyBatch static functions: #19324\r\n  * walletdb: Combine VerifyDatabaseFile and VerifyEnvironment\r\n  * walletdb: Move PeriodicFlush into WalletDatabase\r\n  * walletdb: Move Rewrite into BerkeleyDatabase\r\n\r\nThese PRs require the previous listed to be merged first and need to be merged in order\r\n* [x] Introduce `DatabaseBatch`: #19325\r\n  * walletdb: Refactor DatabaseBatch abstract class from BerkeleyBatch\r\n  * walletdb: Add MakeBatch function to BerkeleyDatabase and use it\r\n* [x] Introduce `WalletDatabase`: #19334\r\n  * walletdb: Move BerkeleyDatabase::Flush(true) to Close()\r\n  * walletdb: Introduce AddRef and RemoveRef functions\r\n  * walletdb: Add BerkeleyDatabase::Open dummy function\r\n  * walletdb: Introduce WalletDatabase abstract class\r\n* [ ] Cleanup the separation: #19335\r\n  * walletdb: track database file use as m_refcount within BerkeleyDatabase\r\n  * walletdb: Move Db->open to BerkeleyDatabase::Open\r\n  * walletdb: Use a global g_fileids instead of m_fileids for each env\r\n  * walletdb: Remove BerkeleyBatch friend class from BerkeleyDatabase\r\n\r\nI will continue to break this down as things get merged.",

This RPC does almost the same thing that the startup command did in that it removes all of the transactions from the target wallet. A blockchain rescan can optionally be triggered, as well as a mempool rescan. The default is to rescan the blockchain but not the mempool.\r\n\r\nHowever a large difference is that `-zapwallettxes` would prevent the mempool from being loaded (#10330) but the RPC does not clear the mempool. However this does mean that the usefulness of this is questionable as the unconfirmed transactions that are being removed from the wallet would still appear in the mempool. The original behavior can be replicated by doing `zapwallettxes` and restarting with `-persistmempool=0`.\r\n\r\nAlso tests are updated to use the new RPC.",

          "body": "This PR adds a new class `SQLiteDatabase` which is a subclass of `WalletDatabase`. This provides access to a SQLite database that is used to store the wallet records. To keep compatibility with BDB and to complexity of the change down, we don't make use of many SQLite's features. We use it strictly as a key-value store. We create a table `main` which has two columns, `key` and `value` both with the type `blob`.\r\n\r\nFor new descriptor wallets, we will create a `SQLiteDatabase` instead of a `BerkeleyDatabase`. There is no requirement that all SQLite wallets are descriptor wallets, nor is there a requirement that all descriptor wallets be SQLite wallets. This allows for existing descriptor wallets to work as well as keeping open the option to migrate existing wallets to SQLite.\r\n\r\nWe keep the name `wallet.dat` for SQLite wallets. We are able to determine which database type to use by searching for specific magic bytes in the `wallet.dat` file. SQLite begins it's files with a null terminated string `SQLite format 3`. BDB has `0x00053162` at byte 12 (note that the byte order of this integer depends on the system endianness). So when we see that there is a `wallet.dat` file that we want to open, we check for the magic bytes to determine which database system to use.\r\n\r\nI decided to keep the `wallet.dat` naming to keep things like backup script to continue to function as they won't need to be modified to look for a different file name. It also simplifies a couple of things in the implementation and the tests as `wallet.dat` is something that is specifically being looked for. If we don't want this behavior, then I do have another branch which creates `wallet.sqlite` files instead, but I find that this direction is easier.",

          "body": "This is a quick patch that fixes #19912 . This change prevents a -Wlogical-op warning that occurs because we're treating a const int value as a boolean. There's no sense checking if a non-zero constant has a value, so I've removed the check.\r\n\r\n#18836 also addresses the same warning, but has a larger scope and will require more review. This pull request will act as a patch to prevent this compile warning until 18836 is merged.",

      "body": "> Are any of your Twitch streams focused on the writing of this PR\r\n\r\nUnfortunately no.\r\n\r\n> or any particular guidance on review?\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make explicitly clear as to when an upgrade is occurring for a particular version. There are two main components to this, although both boil down to the same fix.\r\n\r\n1. `CanSupportFeature` doesn't just check whether the current wallet version (the version written to the wallet) is able to support a particular version, it also checks the `nWalletMaxVersion` memory only variable. This makes some components in `UpgradeWallet` not work or behave unintuitively because we assume `CanSupportFeature` only does the obvious thing of checking the actual wallet version.\r\n2. Because of `nWalletMaxVersion`, for some features, the actual wallet version doesn't change until that feature is used. However for other features, `UpgradeWallet` immediately changes the version number and activates the new feature. This behavior is also unintuitive and could result in the user expecting an upgrade to have occurred when one did not.\r\n\r\nThe solution to these issues is to remove `nWalletMaxVersion`. This makes `CanSupportFeature` intuitive and easy to reason about. This removes the delayed upgrade behavior so `UpgradeWallet` behaves as we would expect it to and the behavior of upgrading is unified for all features.",

It just makes non-SQLite and non-BDB builds more similar to the normal build. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- It makes wallet directory lists always include all wallets so wallets don't appear missing depending on the build.\r\n\r\n- It now triggers specific \"Build does not support SQLite database format\" and \"Build does not support Berkeley DB database format\" errors if a wallet can't be loaded instead of the more ambiguous and scary \"Data is not in recognized format\" error.\r\n\r\nBoth changes are implemented in the last commit. The previous commits are just refactoring cleanups that make the last commit possible and consolidate and reduce code.",

          "body": "The most frequent failure in functional tests are intermittent races. Fixing such bugs is cumbersome because it involves:\r\n* Noticing the failure\r\n* Fetching and reading the log to determine the test case that failed\r\n* Adding a `self.sync_all()` where it was forgotten\r\n* Spamming out a pr and waiting for review, which is already sparse\r\n\r\nAlso, writing a linter to catch those is not possible, nor is review effective in finding these bugs prior to merge.\r\n\r\nFix all future intermittent races caused by a missing sync_block call by calling `sync_all` implicitly after each `generate*`, unless opted out. This ensures that the code is race-free (with regards to blocks) when the tests pass once, instead of our current approach where the code can never be guaranteed to be race-free.",

It's also not clear if there are behavior changes in other commits like 0bd995aa19be65b0dd23df1df571c71428c2bc32 or if these are just refactorings.\r\n\r\nIf there are behavior changes, the best thing would be a followup PR adding some release notes. It seems like `upgradewallet` will now **immediately** make a wallet incompatible with previous versions instead of only allowing new features which **might** make it incompatible in the future. But it would be helpful to know any if there are specific features or versions that are relevant, or if there are other user-visible changes, or if maybe I'm incorrect and the `upgradewallet` RPC always made wallets incompatible before this PR.\r\n",
