    "body": "This pull request updates the wallet synchronization warning text to provide a clearer and more concise message to users. The original text was somewhat clumsy and suffered from grammatical issues, which could lead to confusion. The changes made are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Replace the original warning text with a more concise and grammatically correct version.\r\n- Clarify that transactions using bitcoin from unseen transactions due to ongoing synchronization will be rejected by the network.\r\n\r\nThese changes aim to improve user experience by providing clearer information about potential issues related to wallet synchronization.\r\n\r\nOld text:\r\n\"Recent transactions may not yet be visible, and therefore your wallet's balance might be incorrect. This information will be correct once your wallet has finished synchronizing with the bitcoin network, as detailed below.\r\nAttempting to spend bitcoins that are affected by not-yet-displayed transactions will not be accepted by the network.\"\r\n\r\nNew text:\r\n\"Wallet balance may be inaccurate during synchronization, as recent transactions may still be loading (details below).\r\nCaution: Transactions using bitcoin from unseen transactions (due to ongoing synchronization) will be rejected by the network.\"\r\n",
