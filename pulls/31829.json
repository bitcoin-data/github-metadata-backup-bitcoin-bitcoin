    "body": "This PR is part of the orphan resolution project, see #27463.\r\n\r\nWe want to limit the CPU work and memory used by `TxOrphanage` to avoid denial of service attacks. On master, this is achieved by limiting the number of transactions in this data structure to 100, and the weight of each transaction to 400KWu (the largest standard tx) [0]. We always allow new orphans, but if the addition causes us to exceed 100, we evict one randomly. This is dead simple, but has problems:\r\n- It makes the orphanage trivially churnable: any one peer can render it useless by spamming us with lots of orphans.\r\n- Effectively, opportunistic 1p1c is useless in the presence of adversaries: it is *opportunistic* and pairs a low feerate tx with a child that happens to be in the orphanage.\r\n- This number is also often insufficient for the volume of orphans we handle: historical data show that overflows are pretty common, and there are times where \"it seems like [the node] forgot about the orphans and re-requested them multiple times.\" [1] \r\n \r\nJust jacking up the `-maxorphantxs` number is not a good enough solution, because it doesn't solve the churnability problem, and the effective resource bounds scale poorly.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces numbers for {global, per-peer} {memory usage, announcements}, representing resource limits:\r\n- The (constant) **global announcement limit** is the number of unique (wtxid, peer) pairs in the orphanage [2]. This represents a cap on CPU, and does not change with the number of peers we have. Evictions must happen whenever this limit is reached.\r\n- The (variable) **per-peer announcement limit** is the global announcement limit divided by the number of peers. Peers are allowed to exceed this limit provided the global announcement limit has not been reached. The per-peer announcement limit decreases with more peers.\r\n- The (constant) **per-peer memory usage reservation** is the amount of orphan weight [3] reserved per peer [4]. Reservation means that peers are effectively guaranteed this amount of space. It is not a limit; peers are allowed to exceed this limit provided the global usage limit is not reached.\r\n- The (variable) **global memory usage limit** is the number of peers multiplied by the per-peer reservation [5]. As such, the global memory usage limit scales up with the number of peers we have. Evictions must happen whenever this limit is reached.\r\n- We introduce a \"Peer DoS Score\" which is the maximum between its \"CPU Score\" and \"Memory Score.\" The CPU score is the ratio between the number of orphans announced by this peer / peer announcement limit. The memory score is the total usage of all orphans announced by this peer / peer usage reservation.\r\n\r\nEviction changes in a few ways:\r\n- It is triggered if any of these 3 conditions are true: (1) `-maxorphantxs` is exceeded (2) the global announcement limit is exceeded (3) the global memory usage limit is exceeded.\r\n- Instead of evicting orphans randomly, it does this in a loop until all 3 conditions are no longer true:\r\n  - Sort the peers by their DoS score\r\n  - Select the \"DoSiest peer\" with the highest DoS score.\r\n  - Select a random orphan from the DoSiest peer. Remove this peer as an announcer, or delete the orphan if it only has 1 announcer.\r\n\r\nThis PR also:\r\n- Bounds the number of transactions that can be in a peer's work set within `AddChildrenToWorkset`. It also attempts to use this set more effectively if it fills up: Since work sets can contain orphans that have already been deleted, once per AddChildrenToWorkset call, iterate through the work set and delete the ones that don't correspond to a tx in `m_orphans`.\r\n- Changes the default `-maxorphantxs` to the global announcement limit.\r\n\r\nThis means we can receive 1p1c packages in the presence of spammy peers. It also makes the orphanage more useful and increases our download capacity without drastically increasing orphanage resource usage.\r\n\r\n[0]: This means the effective memory limit in orphan weight is 100 * 400KWu = 40MWu\r\n[1]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stats-on-orphanage-overflows/1421\r\n[2]: Limit is 3000, which is equivalent to one max size ancestor package (24 transactions can be missing inputs) for each peer (default max connections is 125).\r\n[3]: Orphan weight is used in place of actual memory usage because something like \"one maximally sized standard tx\" is easier to reason about than \"considering the bytes allocated for vin and vout vectors, it needs to be within N bytes...\" etc. We can also consider a different formula to encapsulate more the memory overhead but still have an interface that is easy to reason about.\r\n[4]: The limit is 404KWu, which is the maximum size of an ancestor package.\r\n[5]: With 125 peers, this is 50.5MWu, which is a small increase from the existing limit of 40MWu. While the actual memory usage limit is higher (this number does not include the other memory used by `TxOrphanage` to store the outpoints map, etc.), this is within the same ballpark as the old limit.",
