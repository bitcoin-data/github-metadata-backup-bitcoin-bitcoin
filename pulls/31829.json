    "body": "This PR is part of the orphan resolution project, see #27463.\r\n\r\nWe want to limit the CPU work and memory used by `TxOrphanage` to avoid denial of service attacks. On master, this is achieved by limiting the number of transactions in this data structure to 100, and the weight of each transaction to 400KWu (the largest standard tx) [0]. We always allow new orphans, but if the addition causes us to exceed 100, we evict one randomly. This is dead simple, but has problems:\r\n- It makes the orphanage trivially churnable: any one peer can render it useless by spamming us with lots of orphans. It's possible this is happening: \"Looking at data from node alice on 2024-09-14 shows that we’re sometimes removing more than 100k orphans per minute. This feels like someone flooding us with orphans.\" [1]\r\n- Effectively, opportunistic 1p1c is useless in the presence of adversaries: it is *opportunistic* and pairs a low feerate tx with a child that happens to be in the orphanage. So if nothing is able to stay in orphanages, we can't expect 1p1cs to propagate.\r\n- This number is also often insufficient for the volume of orphans we handle: historical data show that overflows are pretty common, and there are times where \"it seems like [the node] forgot about the orphans and re-requested them multiple times.\" [1] \r\n \r\nJust jacking up the `-maxorphantxs` number is not a good enough solution, because it doesn't solve the churnability problem, and the effective resource bounds scale poorly.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces numbers for {global, per-peer} {memory usage, announcements}, representing resource limits:\r\n- The (constant) **global announcement limit** is the number of unique (wtxid, peer) pairs in the orphanage [2]. This represents a cap on CPU, and does not change with the number of peers we have. Evictions must happen whenever this limit is reached.\r\n- The (variable) **per-peer announcement limit** is the global announcement limit divided by the number of peers. Peers are allowed to exceed this limit provided the global announcement limit has not been reached. The per-peer announcement limit decreases with more peers.\r\n- The (constant) **per-peer memory usage reservation** is the amount of orphan weight [3] reserved per peer [4]. Reservation means that peers are effectively guaranteed this amount of space. It is not a limit; peers are allowed to exceed this limit provided the global usage limit is not reached.\r\n- The (variable) **global memory usage limit** is the number of peers multiplied by the per-peer reservation [5]. As such, the global memory usage limit scales up with the number of peers we have. Evictions must happen whenever this limit is reached.\r\n- We introduce a \"Peer DoS Score\" which is the maximum between its \"CPU Score\" and \"Memory Score.\" The CPU score is the ratio between the number of orphans announced by this peer / peer announcement limit. The memory score is the total usage of all orphans announced by this peer / peer usage reservation.\r\n\r\nEviction changes in a few ways:\r\n- It is triggered if any of these 3 conditions are true: (1) `-maxorphantxs` is exceeded (2) the global announcement limit is exceeded (3) the global memory usage limit is exceeded.\r\n- On each iteration of the loop, instead of selecting a random orphan, select a peer and delete 1 of its items. Specifically, select the \"DoSiest peer\" i.e. the one with the highest DoS score. This is the maximum between its CPU DoS score (based on announcements) and Memory DoS score (based on tx weight). After the peer has been selected, we evict a random orphan.\r\n- Instead of evicting orphans, we evict announcements, i.e., we don't erase the orphan unless this peer is its only announcer. Of course, over the course of several iteration loops, we may erase all announcers and then the orphan itself. The purpose of this change is to prevent a peer from being able to churn another peer's announcers.\r\n\r\nThis PR also:\r\n- Bounds the number of transactions that can be in a peer's work set by ensuring it is a subset of the peer's announcements.\r\n- Halts processing at 100 transactions within `EraseForBlock`. Theoretically, it's possible that every transaction in the orphanage spends inputs that are in the block, and we don't want `EraseForBlock` to run for too long.\r\n- Changes the default `-maxorphantxs` to the global announcement limit.\r\n\r\nThis means we can receive 1p1c packages in the presence of spammy peers. It also makes the orphanage more useful and increases our download capacity without drastically increasing orphanage resource usage.\r\n\r\n[0]: This means the effective memory limit in orphan weight is 100 * 400KWu = 40MWu\r\n[1]: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stats-on-orphanage-overflows/1421\r\n[2]: Limit is 3000, which is equivalent to one max size ancestor package (24 transactions can be missing inputs) for each peer (default max connections is 125).\r\n[3]: Orphan weight is used in place of actual memory usage because something like \"one maximally sized standard tx\" is easier to reason about than \"considering the bytes allocated for vin and vout vectors, it needs to be within N bytes...\" etc. We can also consider a different formula to encapsulate more the memory overhead but still have an interface that is easy to reason about.\r\n[4]: The limit is 404KWu, which is the maximum size of an ancestor package.\r\n[5]: With 125 peers, this is 50.5MWu, which is a small increase from the existing limit of 40MWu. While the actual memory usage limit is higher (this number does not include the other memory used by `TxOrphanage` to store the outpoints map, etc.), this is within the same ballpark as the old limit.",

Since we only assign the tx to one peer's workset after 7426afbe62414fa575f91b4f8d3ea63bcc653e8b, more announcers for the same number of orphans doesn't really mean any additional work.",

      "body": "> My understanding is that m_total_orphan_usage exists to limit memory usage, and m_total_announcements to limit CPU usage - but why the number of announcements instead of number of orphans?\r\n\r\nYep, to limit CPU usage. The complexity of eviction for example is bounded by the total number of announcements: in the worst case, each orphan has many announcers and the `MaybeTrimOrphans` loop first removes announcements until each orphan just has 1 left, and then finally can remove transactions. See comment above declaration, \"The loop can run a maximum of m_max_global_announcement times\"\r\n\r\n> Why would it make the situation any less DoSy if we remove an announcer but keep the orphan?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should have stated this in the OP more explicitly, but a major motivation for this eviction strategy is to prevent any peer from being to evict any announcements of another peer, hence the per-peer limits. If we changed the eviction code to remove orphans wholesale instead of just announcements, we'd have a similar situation to today's: an attacker can cause churn of an honest orphan by announcing it along with a lot of other orphans.\r\n\r\nSo evicting announcements instead of orphans isn't less DoSy, but it does make the orphanage less churnable.",

A few ideas:\r\n- Change these to batches of 200 * 10 + 101 * 10 and just do the `wait_until` once to make the test faster. \r\n- Use `-maxorphantxs` to reduce the limit.\r\n- Wait after each orphan is sent. This makes the overall test a lot longer, but makes it less likely we'll hit the timeout.\r\n- Keep a lower count of txns and settle for a test that fails on master but not on this PR.",

      "body": "In commit \"[txorphanage] add per-peer iterator list and announcements accounting\"\r\n\r\nThe cost of this `std::distance` may be *O(num_orphans_per_peer)*, and the `peer : it->second.announcers` loop around can run up to *O(num_announcers_per_tx)*. However, since the sum of all `orphan_list` lengths is equal to the total number of announcements, the overall cost of `EraseTx` is bounded by *O(total_announcements)*. In both `MaybeExpireOrphan` and `EraseForBlock`, the function `EraseTx` may be invoked once per orphan, so I think this may actually mean *O(total_orphans * total_announcements)*, which may be millions, which could mean a concerning amount of time. Something similar may apply to the call in `MaybeTrimOrphans`, but it's a bit more complicated to analyse. Does that sound right?\r\n\r\nOne possibility to reduce this may be to batch the removals. Replace `EraseTx` with a function that takes a `set` of wtxids to remove, and just loops over all peers' `orphan_list`s once, removing anything that's in the set. That would reduce the cost to just *O(total_announcements)*. However, it would mean *always* iterating over all announcements whenever an orphan is erased.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the `iter_list`s could be replaced with sets for faster removal, but that would increase the cost of random evictions in it from *O(1)* to *O(n)*. That might not actually be an improvement for `MaybeTrimOrphans`.\r\n\r\nI think the proper solution is replacing the data structures that together encode the announcement sets (`announcers`, `m_iter_list`, and optionally also `m_work_set`) with a single global boost::multiindex, with hashed by-wtxid index, and a ranked by-(peer,wtxid) index (which allows for fast random access).\r\n\r\n",
