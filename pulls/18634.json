I don’t have an ETA for you unfortunately, but if you’d like to try out the new platform, please let me know your email and I’ll send you an email when we’re letting users try it out\r\n\r\n> Ah yes, you’re looking to run the bitcoin fuzzers, I’m assuming? I believe those should be working - but I think Practicalswift has the account and will need to invite you to the org. Let me double check\r\n\r\nDid he mean that I should be invited by @practicalswift to the org on https://app.fuzzbuzz.io?",
