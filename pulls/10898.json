That is appreciated.\r\n\r\nHere are pointers to some of the open source tools that I use regularly:\r\n* clang's Thread Safety Analysis - see PR #11226 (**please review!**) + #10866 (**please review!**)\r\n* `libFuzzer` - see PR #10440 (**please review!**)\r\n* `afl-fuzz` - see PR #10415 and #10409\r\n* `valgrind` - see PR #11035 (**please review!**)\r\n* `clang-tidy` - see PR #10735\r\n* `clang-format` - see PR #10602\r\n* `pycodestyle` - see PR #9508\r\n* clang's `AddressSanitizer` (ASan: `-fsanitize=address`) \r\n* clang's `LeakSanitizer` (LSan: `-fsanitize=leak`)\r\n* clang's `MemorySanitizer` (MSan: `-fsanitize=memory`)\r\n* clang's `ThreadSanitizer` (TSan: `-fsanitize=thread`)\r\n* clang's `UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer` (UBSan: `-fsanitize=undefined`)\r\n* `flintpp`\r\n* `oclint`\r\n* `cppcheck`\r\n\r\nThe list is not at all exhaustive - I try to use as many tools as possible to increase diversity in the classes of issues covered. In addition to the above I use some custom/proprietary analysis tools/scripts, but they are not that interesting or general.\r\n\r\nIf you want to help, please review the open PR:s mentioned above to increase the chance of them getting merged :-)\r\n\r\n",
