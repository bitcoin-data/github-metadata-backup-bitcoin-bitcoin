    "body": "This makes sure the initial address self-announcement a node sends to a peer happends in a separate P2P message. This has benefits for both inbound and outbound connections:\r\n\r\nFor inbound connections from a peer to us, previously, we might send the self-announcement along with our response to a GETADDR request. However, the self-announcement might replace an address from the GETADDR response. This isn't clean.\r\n\r\nFor outbound connections from us to a peer, previously, it could have happend that we send the self-announcement along with other addresses. Since shortly after connection open, the peer might only have one rate-limiting token for us, and the addresses are shuffeld on arrival, it's possible that the self-announcement gets rate-limited. However, note that these rate-limitings seem to be rare in practice.\r\n\r\nThis is inspired by and based on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33699#issuecomment-3462287763. The discussion there should be helpful for reviewers. ",

This has benefits for both\ninbound and outbound connections:\n\nFor inbound connections from a peer to us, previously, we might send\nthe self-announcement along with our response to a GETADDR request.\nHowever, the self-announcement might replace an address from the\nGETADDR response. This isn't clean.\n\nFor outbound connections from us to a peer, previously, it could have\nhappend that we send the self-announcement along with other addresses.\nSince shortly after connection open, the peer might only have one\nrate-limiting token for us, and the addresses are shuffeld on arrival,\nit's possible that the self-announcement gets rate-limited. However,\nnote that these rate-limitings seem to be rare in practice.\n\nThis is inspired by and based on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33699#issuecomment-3462287763\n\nCo-Authored-By: Anthony Towns <aj@erisian.com.au>",

This is probably not a big issue in practice, since most onion/i2p peers should support addrv2.\r\n\r\nThe third skipped check from `PushAddress` (`peer.m_addr_known->contains(addr.GetKey())`) is not needed because we empty  `m_addr_known` right before self-advertising.",

This is based on the following facts: \r\n- `m_addr_token_bucket` is initialized to 1 and then incremented by `MAX_ADDR_TO_SEND` before the `GETADDR` message is sent.\r\n- `m_getaddr_sent` is set to `false` after the first reception of an `ADDR/ADDRV2` message.\r\n- The receiver of an  `ADDR/ADDRV2`  message will relay an address if `vAddr.size() <= 10`, and `m_getaddr_sent` is `false`.\r\n- Always guarantee that there will still be 1 token left for self-advertisement.",
