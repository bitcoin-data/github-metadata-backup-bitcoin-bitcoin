    "body": "This makes sure the initial address self-announcement a node sends to a peer happends in a separate P2P message. This has benefits for both inbound and outbound connections:\r\n\r\nFor inbound connections from a peer to us, previously, we might send the self-announcement along with our response to a GETADDR request. However, the self-announcement might replace an address from the GETADDR response. This isn't clean.\r\n\r\nFor outbound connections from us to a peer, previously, it could have happend that we send the self-announcement along with other addresses. Since shortly after connection open, the peer might only have one rate-limiting token for us, and the addresses are shuffeld on arrival, it's possible that the self-announcement gets rate-limited. However, note that these rate-limitings seem to be rare in practice.\r\n\r\nThis is inspired by and based on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33699#issuecomment-3462287763. The discussion there should be helpful for reviewers. ",
