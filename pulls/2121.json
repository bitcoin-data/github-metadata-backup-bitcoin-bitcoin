    "body": "# \n\nA major issue many have faced in using bitcoind to build applications is the lack of RPC support for tracking transactions and balances without having to know and keep associated private keys in the wallet. Oftentimes one might want to watch other people's transactions or to keep signing nodes behind tighter security while using separate relay nodes to service all nonsigning, non-key-generating application functionality such as sending payment and confirmation alerts.\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives, I have had to build a bunch of custom software - much of which duplicates functionality that is already present in the Satoshi Client. This pull request is an attempt at addressing some of these concerns without having to fundamentally restructure the client architecture. (Thanks, sipa!)\n\nThe proposal is to add another kind of object to the wallet database - a bitcoin address sans private key - which the client treats as if it were any other wallet adddress except for when it comes to signing and privkey export operations. This means RPC calls such as getreceivedbyaddress and listtransactions can be used on arbitrary bitcoin addresses.\n\nI've added an RPC call:\n\n```\nimportaddress <bitcoinaddress> [label] [rescan=true]\n```\n\nThe address is added as a new type of serialized object in wallet.dat and loads into the key maps of the CKeyStore instances with the key set to the CKeyID and the secret set to an empty vector.\n\nPlease test it out and let me know what you think.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Eric Lombrozo\n",

          "body": "bitcoind now supports loading more than one wallet at once.\n\nA singleton object of type CWalletManager now exists. It handles dynamic loading/unloading and synchronization of wallets and allows different parts of the application to access wallets by name.\n\nA new CWallet\\* parameter has been added to the RPC functions. Functions which do not use a wallet simply ignore it. In addition, a new field has been added to CRPCCommand that tells us whether or not the function can be called on a wallet.\n\nWallet-specific information has been removed from RPC method getinfo. Instead, getinfo just reports how many\nwallets are currently loaded. Detailed wallet info is now available via the listwallets method.\n\nFour new RPC methods have been added:\n- listwallets\n  Returns an array containing wallet information.\n- usewallet <walletname> <method> [params] \n  Allows you to apply existing RPC commands to different wallets.\n  A default wallet named the empty string is always loaded and is used if calls are made without usewallet.\n  Example: bitcoind usewallet foo listreceivedbyaddress 0 true\n  (thanks, gmaxwell, for the idea)\n- loadwallet <walletname> [rescan=false] [upgradewallet=false] [maxversion=(latest)]\n  Dynamically loads an existing wallet file wallet-<walletname>.dat.\n  If no wallet file exists a new wallet is created. The default wallet file is always called wallet.dat.\n- unloadwallet <walletname>\n\nTo specify additional wallets at startup, use option -usewallet=foo -usewallet=bar etc...as detailed here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2124#issuecomment-11653964 and https://github.com/CodeShark/bitcoin/commit/9d201cfaf9f54042ec0ff8265cd2201545568b6d\n\nTODO:\n- Clean up I/O in CWalletManager::LoadWallet - debug, error, and UI output functions.\n- Check synchronization code.\n- Test mining functionality. Allow RPC mining on arbitrary wallets.\n- Integrate with Qt.\n",

      "message": "Separating Transaction Signing From Transaction Processing\n==========================================================\n\nA major issue many have faced in using bitcoind to build applications is the lack of RPC support for tracking transactions and balances without having to know and keep associated private keys in the wallet. Oftentimes I want to watch other people's transactions or to keep my signing nodes behind tighter security while using separate relay nodes to service all nonsigning, non-key-generating application functionality such as sending payment and confirmation alerts.\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives, I have had to build a bunch of custom software - much of which duplicates functionality that is already present in the Satoshi Client. This fork is an attempt at addressing some of these concerns without having to fundamentally restructure the client architecture. (Thanks, sipa!)\n\nThe proposal is to add another kind of object to the wallet database - a bitcoin address sans private key - which the client treats as if it were any other wallet adddress except for when it comes to signing and privkey export operations. This means RPC calls such as getreceivedbyaddress and listtransactions can be used on arbitrary bitcoin addresses.\n\nI've added an RPC call:\n\n\timportaddress <bitcoinaddress> [label] [rescan=true]\n\nThe address is added as a new type of serialized object in wallet.dat and loads into the key maps of the CKeyStore instances with the key set to the CKeyID and the secret set to an empty vector.\n\nPlease test it out and let me know what you think.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Eric Lombrozo",

I'm going to be using this functionality for an upcoming new version of [Coinpunk](http://coinpunk.org), to support client-side encryption for private keys, so that `bitcoind` becomes a listener, and cannot spend any of the user's money. This is a huge linchpin in my new version, and it enables this capability for people developing web services and offline clients that use a central `bitcoind` instance to keep up with the blockchain while they are offline. And of course cold storage wallets that generate the private keys on their own end.\n\nI won't be able to release the new Coinpunk until this is released, so it would be amazing if this commit could get into the next release. I don't think it's too dangerous, just because I believe it's not handling anything that could potentially lose bitcoins, but I could be mistaken. But it would be awesome.\n\nLet me know if I can help in any way. Thanks, you guys are awesome. :-)\n",

Since bitcoind is not going to access the keys anyway while they're encrypted, it shouldn't matter that they're actually zeros. So that will effectively produce watch-only addresses. However, it still wouldn't be possible to add new watch-only addresses via rpc, which this patch can do.\n\nBy the way, could a slightly cleaner implementation of this be to store watch-only addresses as normal keys (except where the encrypted private key is cleared) instead of adding the new \"address\" data type in the walletdb?\n",

      "body": "I compiled and tested this code, and it seems to work fine. Does it collide with HD wallets? If not, I would really like to advocate for getting this in. I strongly believe that this code solves a critically urgent security problem.\n\nWithout this code, I'm concerned that we may get more services that put private keys on servers simply because they have no choice, which could lead to more major thefts, which could contribute to undermining the soundness of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The last thing Bitcoin needs right now is another high profile wallet theft fiasco.\n\nThis is a very important and very significant security upgrade, that I believe will dramatically lead to the improvement of security across the board, for many different types of applications. To provide analogies, this could be as important to bitcoind security as ProPolice was to buffer overflow prevention, or PBKDF2 was to password hashing.\n\nPlease consider including this in the next release of bitcoind. Do it for the people that have lost a lot of money to server wallet thefts. _Do it for the children._\n\n:wink: \n",

Which makes me excited about its potential to improve bitcoin security, but also terrified because they are using it with unstable bitcoind. It would be really great if someone was able to look at this, I really doubt it would take more than a few hours for a seasoned member of the glorious, highly talented bitcoin development team to resolve the merge conflicts on it (@sipa? @jgarzik?).\n",

This is used in SelectCoins (CreateTransaction would fail to sign them anyway).\n- Different storage format in database, which supports P2SH too.\n",
