    "body": "Changes a CI task that runs test the previously not run `test/functional/interface_usdt_*.py` functional tests (added in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24358). \r\n\r\nThis task is run as CirussCI `compute_engine_instance` VM as hooking into the tracepoints is not possible in CirrusCI docker containers (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296#issuecomment-1024920845). We use an unoffical PPA and untrusted  `bpfcc-tools` package in the CI as the Ubuntu jammy and Debian bullseye packages are outdated. We hope use an official package when new Ubuntu/Debian releases are available for the use with Google Compute Engine.\r\n\r\nWe make sure to hook into `bitcoind` binaries in USDT interface tests via their PID, instead of their path. This makes sure multiple functional tests running in parallel don't interfere with each other.\r\n\r\nThe utxocache USDT interface tests is adopted to a change of the functional test framework that wasn't detected as the tests weren't run in the CI. As the tracepoints expose internals, it can happen that we need to adopt the interface test when internals change. This is a bit awkward, and if it happens to frequently, we should consider generalizing the tests a bit more. For now it's fine, I think.\r\n\r\nSee the individual commit messages for more details on the changes.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24782\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear from reviewers:\r\n- Are we OK with using the [`hadret/bpfcc`](https://launchpad.net/~hadret/+archive/ubuntu/bpfcc) PPA for now? There is a clear plan when to drop it and as is currently, it could only impact the newly added VM task. \r\n- ~~Adding a new task increases CI runtime and costs. Should an existing `container` CI task be ported to a VM and reused instead?~~ Yes, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25528#issuecomment-1179509525 ",

This\nmeans, the USDT interface tests somewhat awardly depend on these\ninternals. If internals change, the tests have to adopt to that change.\nPreviously, the USDT interface tests weren't run in the CI so changes\ncould break the USDT interface tests without being noticed (e.g.\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25486).\n\nIn fa13375aa3fcb4fd5b9e0d4c69ac31cf66c3209a a 'self.rescan_utxos()' call\nwas added in the 'generate()' function of the test framework.\n'rescan_utxos()' causes the UTXO cache to be flushed. In the USDT\ninterface tests for the 'utxocache:flush' trancepoint, 'generate()' is\nused. As the utxo cache is now flushed more often, the number of flushes\nthe tests expectes need to be adopted. Also, the utxo cache has now a\ndifferent size when being flushed.\n\nThe utxocache tracepoint is tested by shutting the node down and\npruning blocks, to test the 'for_prune' argument.\n\nChanges:\n- A list 'expected_flushes' is now used which contains 'mode',\n  'for_prune', and 'size' for each expected flush.\n- When a flush happens, the expected-flush is removed from the list.\n  This list is checked to be empty (unchanged).\n- Previously, shutting down caused these two flushes:\n    UTXOCacheFlush(duration=*, mode=ALWAYS, size=104, memory=*, for_prune=False)\n    UTXOCacheFlush(duration=*, mode=ALWAYS, size=0, memory=*, for_prune=False)\n  now it causes these flushes:\n    UTXOCacheFlush(duration=*, mode=ALWAYS, size=2, memory=*, for_prune=False)\n    UTXOCacheFlush(duration=*, mode=ALWAYS, size=0, memory=*, for_prune=False)\n  The 104 UTXOs flushed previously were mainly coinbase UTXOs generated\n  in previous tests and the test setup. These are now already flushed.\n- In the 'for_prune' test we previously hooked into the tracepoint\n  before mining blocks. This changed to only get notified about the\n  tracepoint being triggered for the prune. Here, the utxo cache is\n  empty already as it has just been flushed in 'generate()'.\n  old:\n    UTXOCacheFlush(duration=*, mode=NONE, size=350, memory=*, for_prune=True)\n  new:\n    UTXOCacheFlush(duration=*, mode=NONE, size=0, memory=*, for_prune=True)\n",

This seems to be unrelated to the tests. More the tracepoint macros in general. Probably a problem with the Systemtap package (`systemtap-sdt-dev`) in bookworm? Per https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/systemtap-sdt-dev it's version 4.7, which is also what we use in depends since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25360. Does a depends build on bookworm fail too?\r\n\r\nI'll also do some poking.\r\n\r\nedit: the variadic marco arg was indeed not present in 4.5 (which we used previously): https://sourceware.org/git/?p=systemtap.git;a=commitdiff;h=ecab2afea46099b4e7dfd551462689224afdbe3a. I think it also has something to do with clang, `-pedantic` and C++20. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67912343/how-to-resolve-must-specify-at-least-one-argument-for-parameter-of-variad",

That doesn't seem to be worth the effort.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to using a private ppa would be to bump the OS version in `/etc/apt/sources.list` before installing the package (See for example https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/commit/0da6949a7bc3586cbf160738e8f09b209ea97a06 ), though that'd just seem too brittle.\r\n\r\nTo preserve CI resources, I am thinking about combining this with another task. Since a wallet would be good to also cover the coinselection traces, and a recent-ish OS is required, we could re-use one of the sanitizer builds or the i686 build?",

These containers have\nlimited capabilities - especially CAP_SYS_ADMIN is missing. See\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296#issuecomment-1024920845\n\nWe need elevated privileges to hook into the USDT tracepoints. We use a\nCirrusCI \"compute_engine_instance\" (a VM, not a container) where we have\nthe required privileges. The ubunut-mininmal-2204-lts was choosen with\ndebian-11 being an alternative. Both pack an outdated 'bpfcc-tools'\npackage (v0.18.0) from 2020. This version prints warnings to stderr\nduring BPF bytecode compilation, which causes our functional test runner\nto fail. This is fixed in newer verison.\n\nUntil debian-12 or a newer Ubuntu release is avaliable as image in GCE\n(https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details), we use a\nthird-party and untrusted PPA that releases up-to-date versions of the\npackage.\n\nThe official iovisor (authors of BCC) PPA is outdated too. An\nalternative would be to compile BCC from source in the CI.\n\nCo-authored-by: MacroFake <falke.marco@gmail.com>\n",

      "message": "ci: run USDT interface test in a VM\n\nOur CI tasks are run by CirrusCI in Docker containers in a Google\nCompute Engine based Kubernetes environment. These containers have\nlimited capabilities - especially CAP_SYS_ADMIN is missing. See\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23296#issuecomment-1024920845\n\nWe need elevated privileges to hook into the USDT tracepoints. We use a\nCirrusCI \"compute_engine_instance\" (a VM, not a container) where we have\nthe required privileges. The ubunut-mininmal-2204-lts was choosen with\ndebian-11 being an alternative. Both pack an outdated 'bpfcc-tools'\npackage (v0.18.0) from 2020. This version prints warnings to stderr\nduring BPF bytecode compilation, which causes our functional test runner\nto fail. This is fixed in newer verison.\n\nUntil debian-12 or a newer Ubuntu release is avaliable as image in GCE\n(https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details), we use a\nthird-party and untrusted PPA that releases up-to-date versions of the\npackage.\n\nThe official iovisor (authors of BCC) PPA is outdated too. An\nalternative would be to compile BCC from source in the CI.\n\nCo-authored-by: MacroFake <falke.marco@gmail.com>",
