    "body": "Because #30647 reduced the timewarp attack threshold from 7200s to 600s, our miner code will fail to propose a block template (on testnet4) if the last block of the previous period has a timestamp two hours in the future. This PR fixes that and also adds a test.\r\n\r\nThe non-test changes in the last commit should be in v28, otherwise miners have to patch it themselves. If necessary I can split that out into a separate PR, but I prefer to get the tests in as well.\r\n\r\nIn order to add the test, we activate BIP94 on regtest.\r\n\r\nIn order for the test to run faster, we reduce its difficulty retarget period to 144, the same number that's already used for softfork activation logic. Regtest does not actually adjust its difficulty, so this change has no effect (except for `getnetworkhashps`, see commit).\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach would be to run this test on testnet4, by hardcoding its first 2015 in the test suite. But since the timewarp mitigation is a serious candidate for a future mainnet softfork, it seems better to just deploy it on regtest.\r\n\r\nThe next commits add a test and fix the miner code.\r\n\r\nThe `MAX_TIMEWARP` constant is moved to `consensus.h` so both validation and miner code have access to it.",

      "body": "Hate to be that guy, but this form of the time-warp mitigation closes off the possibility of using something like forward blocks for scaling bitcoin on-chain in the future. That was my voiced objection to the \"create consensus clean-up\" on the mailing list. Of course it only applies to testnet4, but in practice this ends up throwing up a hurdle to later deployment of something like forward blocks, as it can no longer be tested on the primary testnet. Has there been consideration given to limiting the *relative* amount of time-warp compared to the last time-warp, instead of an absolute requirement that total timewarp be less than a certain %age?",
