    "body": "This change drops `shutdown.h` and `shutdown.cpp` files, replacing them with a `NodeContext::shutdown` member which is used to trigger shutdowns directly. This gets rid of an unnecessary layer of indirection, and allows getting rid of the `kernel::g_context` global.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR tries to improve error handling of `SignalInterrupt` code by marking relevant methods `[[nodiscard]]` to avoid the possibility of uncaught exceptions mentioned https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27861#discussion_r1255496707.\r\n\r\nBehavior is changing In a few cases which are noted in individual commit messages. Particularly: GUI code more consistently interrupts RPCs when it is shutting down, shutdown state no longer persists between unit tests, the stop RPC now returns an RPC error if requesting shutdown fails instead of aborting, and other failed shutdown calls now log errors instead of aborting.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a net reduction in lines of code, but in some cases the explicit error handling and lack of global shutdown functions do make it more verbose. The verbosity can be seen as good thing if it discourages more code from directly triggering shutdowns, and instead encourages code to return errors or send notifications that could be translated into shutdowns. Probably a number of existing shutdown calls could just be replaced by better error handling.",

As a standalone library the libbitcoinkernel should not have to rely on code that accesses shutdown state through a global. Instead, replace it with an interrupt class that is owned by the kernel context. Additionally this moves the remaining usages of the `uiInterface` out of the kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken here uses the notification interface to externalize the existing shutdown code from the kernel library. The `SignalInterrupt` kernel context member is passed by reference to the `ChainstateManager` to allow for the termination of long-running kernel functions and sending interrupt signals.\r\n",

This PR also drops the last reference to the `uiInterface` global in kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThis pull request contains a subset of patches originally proposed in #27711. It will be part of a series of changes required to make handling of interrupts (or in other words the current shutdown procedure) in the kernel library more transparent and less reliable on global mutable state. The set of patches contained here was originally proposed by @ryanofsky [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711#issuecomment-1580779869). ",

          "body": "This PR lets indexing code mostly run outside of the node process. It also improves indexing sync logic, which is moved out of indexing code to a new [`node::SyncChain()`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/8d8cdcb37005030f646ba3c45f7f54f556efb8bf/src/node/chain.h#L24-L39) function.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the commits in this PR are small refactoring changes that move code from `src/index/` to `src/node/`, or replace references to node types like `CBlockIndex`, `CChain`, `CChainState` in index code. There are only two commits affecting indexing sync logic which make complicated or substantive changes:\r\n\r\n- [`8746b35301c5` indexes: Rewrite chain sync logic, remove racy init](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/8746b35301c5f65ff3200555fb2b82417fd2c758)\r\n- [`ad88f50ddd12` indexes: Initialize indexes without holding cs_main](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24230/commits/ad88f50ddd129dddd974bbf9fd7d86ec86b65508)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commit messages have more details about these and other changes. Followups to this PR will reuse indexing sync code for wallets (#15719, #11756) and let indexes run in separate processes (#10102)",

          "body": "This is a (rough draft) clean rewrite of BIP300 (Drivechain) consensus-level code.\r\n\r\nInstead of a separate sidechain database (which may be prone to hard-to-review/test consistency issues), instead the unusable 8 MSB of the UTXO index are reserved for non-UTXO database entries, and the existing UTXO db and caching layer is shared. This can be refactored in the future, but I think it is the cleanest and most reviewable approach initially - open to other ideas, though. There's also some ugliness in the undo data to handle restoring the new data, but it's abstracted and shouldn't be too hard to reason about.\r\n\r\nUsing these new primitives, Drivechains can be reimplemented with a UTXO-like model. Note that there is zero activation logic in the current PR: the protocol changes are *always* active. Therefore, this will *not* work (at least not safely) on Bitcoin today, and cannot be deployed without significant additional changes to handle an activation.\r\n\r\nA new `SERIALIZE_TRANSACTION_FOR_WEIGHT` serialization flag is also added, that is meant only for weight counting. This allows for adjusting weight (upward) to fit additional resource requirements by new functionality. In this case, several Drivechain \"messages\" are expected to have a larger burden than their `OP_RETURN` encoding would otherwise weigh. However, the specific adjustments are not implemented in this draft.\r\n\r\nAs a consensus change, this can only be implemented with community support. Many people seem to have opinions, but please keep them to other forums. Despite providing and continuing this implementation, I myself do not thereby endorse or otherwise comment on the proposal itself.\r\n\r\nTherefore, not looking for concept ACKs/NACKs (ie, about Drivechains), just *Approach* ACKs / constructive criticism (ie, about *how* I'm implementing it).",

          "body": "Currently the *.dat files in the blocksdir store the data received from remote peers as-is. This may be problematic when a program other than Bitcoin Core tries to interpret them by accident. For example, an anti-virus program or other program may scan them and move them into quarantine, or delete them, or corrupt them. This may cause Bitcoin Core to fail a reorg, or fail to reply to block requests (via P2P, RPC, REST, ...).\r\n\r\nFix this, similar to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6650, by rolling a random XOR pattern over the dat files when writing or reading them.\r\n\r\nObviously this can only protect against programs that accidentally and unintentionally are trying to mess with the dat files. Any program that intentionally wants to mess with the dat files can still trivially do so.\r\n\r\nThe XOR pattern is only applied when the blocksdir is freshly created, and there is an option to disable it (on creation), so that people can disable it, if needed.",

Destroying the workers pool once the\r\ninitial sync completes.\r\nNote: by default, the parallelized sync process is not enabled.\r\n\r\nNow the juicy part:\r\nIn my computer, with the node in debug mode and on IBD, with `-indexworkers=4`, the\r\nblock filter index generation took less than an hour. While, in master, the sync took more than 7 hours.\r\n\r\nImportant Note:\r\nAs the access to the block data on disk is protected by `cs_main`, this new feature runs substantially\r\nfaster when the node is not in IBD.\r\n\r\nFootnote:\r\nThis is part of a larger project :).",

Currently, that requires figuring out where the test's working directory is since it changes on every test run. Tests can be run with `-printtoconsole=1` to show debug logging to the terminal, but it's nice to keep `debug.log` continuously open in an editor, for example.\r\n\r\nEven if not using a debugger, it's sometimes helpful to see `debug.log` and other artifacts after the test completes.\r\n\r\nSimilar functionality is already possible with the functional tests using the `--tmpdir=` and `--nocleanup` arguments.",

          "body": "Add `util::Result` support for returning more error information and make use of it in [LoadChainstate method](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665/commits/93af79a1aae9ad483e8ee38ad63f0256464e7153) as an initial application. Followup PR [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) uses it more broadly to return errors and warnings from wallet loading functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis change adds two major features to the result class:\r\n\r\n- For better error handling, adds the ability to return a value on failure, not just a value on success. This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations.\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives & design notes\r\n\r\nThe main goal for the `util::Result` class is to provide a standard way for functions to report error and warnings strings. The interface tries to make it easy to provide detailed error feedback to end users, without cluttering code or making it harder to return other result information. There have been multiple iterations of the design using different internal representations and providing different capabilities:\r\n\r\n|   | Representation (approximate)                   | Notes |\r\n|---|------------------------------------------------|-------|\r\n| _1_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Original #25218 implementation in da98fd2efc1a6b9c6e876cf3e227a8c2e9a10827. Good capabilities, but larger type size. Supports error standardized error reporting and customized error handling with failure values. |\r\n| _2_ | `variant<T,bilingual_str>`                | Final #25218 implementation in 7a45c33d1f8a758850cf8e7bd6ad508939ba5c0d. No support for returning failure values so not useful in many cases.\r\n| _3_ | `variant<monostate,T,F>`                 | Pending #25601 implementation that allows choosing whether to use standardized error reporting or return custom failure values, but doesn't support having both at the same time, like approaches _(1)_, _(4)_, _(5)_, _(6)_ do. |\r\n | _4_ | `tuple<variant<T,F>,bilingual_str>`      | Original #25608 implementation in c29d3008de9314dd463ed08e8bff39fe55324498. Basically the same as _(1)_ except it uses separate success and failure types instead of the same type. Using separate success and failure types makes the result class a little less flexible but can help avoid some ambiguity and inconsistent result states. |\r\n| _5_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Final #25608 implementation in dd91f294206ac87b213d23bb76656a0a5f0f4781. Essentially the same as original implementation _(1)_ except has some usability improvements. |\r\n| _6_ | `tuple<T,unique_ptr<tuple<F,bilingual_str>>` | Pending #25665 implementation (this PR). Supports returning failure values, uses separate success and failure types to avoid ambiguity, uses `unique_ptr` to reduce result type size, and avoids heap allocation in the happy path. |\r\n\r\n### Prior discussions & history\r\n\r\n- _furszy_ introduced a `BResult` class providing a standard error reporting mechanism in [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218). It was renamed to `util::Result` in [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) but kept the same representation and capabilities.\r\n\r\n- _MarcoFalke_ suggested using `BResult` for the `LoadChainstate` function in [#25308 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25308#issuecomment-1181674645). Inability to use `BResult` there due to lack of support for failure values led to initial work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _w0xlt_ wrote a `StructuredResult` class in [#25308](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25601) adding the ability to return failure values but sacrificing standard error reporting, which led to more work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _martinus_ suggested a space optimization in [#25608 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608#discussion_r921049409) that also made it easier to support distinct failure & success types, leading to [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) as a replacement for [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).",

      "body": "> Does tsan pass locally, if you run the fun tests with it?\r\n\r\nTsan seems to output warnings so the test runner fails. I was able to reproduce the CI error from https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5608405029617664 locally by running\r\n\r\n ```bash\r\ncd /ci_container_base/ci/scratch/build/bitcoin-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\r\ntest/functional/test_runner.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am a little confused though because even though testrunner fails on the create_cache step, running it manually with \r\n\r\n```bash\r\ntest/functional/create_cache.py --cachedir=test/cache --tmpdir=/tmp/cache\r\n```\r\n\r\nseems to succeed.\r\n\r\nI also found that if I ran `src/bitcoind -regtest` and `src/bitcoin-cli -regtest stop`, shutdown would work, but with the tsan warnings, which I'll try to debug:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nWARNING: ThreadSanitizer: data race

See [doc/design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/design/multiprocess.md) for usage details and future plans.\r\n\r\nThe change is implemented by adding a new [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that spawns new wallet and node subprocesses that can be controlled over a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) by calling [`Node`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/node.h), [`Wallet`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/wallet.h), and [`ChainClient`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/chain.h) methods. When running with split processes, you can see the IPC messages going back and forth in `-debug=1` output. Followup PR's #19460 and #19461 add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/ipc/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing this change are available on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).\r\n",

          "body": "#26742 significantly increased the http server shutdown speed, but also introduced a bug (#27722 - see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27722#issuecomment-1559453982 for steps to reproduce on master) that causes http server shutdown to halt in case of a remote client disconnection. This happens because `evhttp_request_set_on_complete_cb` is never called and thus the request is never removed from `g_requests`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that bug, and improves robustness of the code by encapsulating the request tracking logic. Earlier approaches (#27909, #27245, #19434) attempted to resolve this but [imo are fundamentally unsafe](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27909#discussion_r1265614783) because of differences in lifetime between an `evhttp_request` and `evhttp_connection`.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to keep track of open requests or connections, we just [need to ensure](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19420#issue-648067169) that there are no active requests on server shutdown. Because a connection can have multiple requests, and a request can be completed in various ways (the request actually being handled, or the client performing a remote disconnect), keeping a counter per connection seems like the approach with the least overhead to me.\r\n\r\nFixes #27722\r\n\r\n",

Not locking cs_main while validating assumeutxo snapshots, so the node is responsive when the background chainstate download finishes.\r\n2. Deleting the background chainstate right away when it is no longer needed, instead of waiting until the next restart, which takes up extra disk space and slows down the next startup.",

It's a fairly extensive PR to review, and the changes don't always help with verbosity (e.g. `(!(*Assert(Assert(m_context)->shutdown))())` instead of `StartShutdown`), but it seems like the right direction to go regardless.\r\n\r\nI've gone through the code multiple times now and it looks good, so I don't think I'll come up with (m)any more comments, but I'm not fully comfortable yet with all the implications of the changes so I'll have to spend some more time on it before signing off. Will try to do that in the next few days.",

          "body": "Looking for conceptual feedback!\r\n\r\nThis is one of two options for how we may embed ASMap files into Bitcoin Core releases. This approach here uses a binary dump of the file which is then committed to the source code as a header file. The alternative approach is not having the data in the source code but only adding it during the build phase of a release. I initially favored the second approach but it seems harder to achieve than I originally expected and I have also started to see the downsides of this approach as well. For example, we would not have the asmap data available in dev builds, meaning those who want to use asmap with dev builds would always need to provide a file as input. Also, opening a PR for new ASMap data before the first RC allows for earlier testing of the data and the PR itself is the natural place where reviewers can give feedback. If the asmap data is only included during the build phase potential problems can only be discovered while testing RC1 and a separate issue would need to be opened to coordinate a fix. I had also not realized that the binary dump header file approach here is very similar to the embedding of the seeds.\r\n\r\nI am still planning to demo how the embedding would work during the build phase, but since I have started to like the approach shown here a lot more lately, I thought I would demo it and hear people's opinions on it.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the binary dump header file could simply be generated using `xxd -i path/to/ip_asn.map init/ip_asn.h`. But I would also be open to adding an equivalent to `makeseeds.py` to make the process more convenient if people would prefer that. ",

This could be useful in the future for using or testing these classes without having to instantiate any form of signal handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).

(followup?)\r\n- [ ] pick a good default for `default_coinbase_tx_additional_output_size` (see `getblocktemplate` RPC)\r\n\r\n### Noise\r\n\r\n- [ ] use EllSwift https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/pull/66, implemented in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/28\r\n- [ ] certificate signing issue: https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/717, fix in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/29\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- [ ] add `-sv2bind` and `-sv2allowip`\r\n- [x] persist static key (needs #29229)\r\n- [ ] optional `-sv2cert`\r\n- [x] create `Sv2Transport` subclass similar to `V2Transport`: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/27\r\n- [ ] drop `Sv2TemplateProvider::SendBuf`, reuse p2p socket handling if possible\r\n- [ ] limit number of connected clients\r\n- [ ] maybe limit (number of) `coinbase_output_max_additional_size`\r\n- [ ] TMP / TODO comments at the top of `sv2_messages.h`\r\n- [ ] adjust base58 encoding of authority public key https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/721\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] expand sv2_template_provider_tests\r\n- [ ] add transport fuzzer\r\n- [ ] add template provider fuzzer\r\n\r\n### Template generation and updating\r\n\r\n- [x] hold on to templates a bit after a block is found https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/709 (in case of race to prevent downstream crashes, though we still wouldn't relay it without additional changes)\r\n- [ ] hold on to template transactions even if the mempool drops them (for some time)\r\n- [ ] group templates with the same `coinbase_tx_additional_output_size`\r\n- [ ] don't generate templates when no client is connected\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\n- [ ] move / refactor `GetMerklePathForCoinbase` helper (see Future Work in original PR, and https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/567)\r\n- [ ] truncate long trace messages\r\n\r\n## Potential followups\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement Noise protocol and mock client in Python, add functional tests (based on `test/sv2_template_provider_tests.cpp`)\r\n- [ ] use process separation, e.g. a `bitcoin-tp` binary, see [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md?plain=1)\r\n- [ ] make template updates push based, on top of Cluster Mempool, see [docs/stratum-v2.md](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/blob/2023/11/sv2-poll/doc/stratum-v2.md) (for new blocks it's already push based)\r\n- [ ] push empty template for the next block (downstream can ignore or use, https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues/715)\r\n  - send prevhash for this template as soon as any new block arrives\r\n- [ ] push optimistic template for the next block\r\n  - send prevhash if and only if our template won (i.e. we got a `SubmitSolution` message)",

How about adding a try-catch block in the various `MakeNodeInit` that populates the correct `exit_status` and returns a `nullptr`?\r\n\r\nThis is not a good place to handle exceptions, because this function is intended to be called by `interfaces::Init` constructors, and in constructors exceptions are a more natural error handling mechanism than return codes. The best thing to do here is let any exception bubble up, and the best place to catch exceptions would be around the `interfaces::MakeNodeInit` and `interfaces::MakeGuiInit` functions (which can already throw `bad_alloc`) which call this.\r\n\r\nExceptions are not currently caught around the `interfaces::MakeNodeInit` and `interfaces::MakeGuiInit` calls and I do not think it would make sense to change that now. These calls are the very first calls that get made in the `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` `main()` functions before anything else happens: before any threads are created, before any libraries are initialized, even before any command line arguments are parsed. So it should be impossible for these functions to fail unless the operating environment is unusable, and if they do fail there is no cleanup or logging that could be done, and it would be doubtful if even printing would work. So there would only by drawbacks trying to intercept the failure there as well. \r\n\r\nBasically this is a long way of saying if core dumps are enabled by the OS, it would be safe and appropriate to core dump here.",

This may be possible to trigger when running the GUI before the kernel context is initialized with `app.baseInitialize()`. We could just move it to after `baseInitialize` (see my [patch here](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commit/2df7a669a07be01ef2cce0d22891617bc19060d7)), but I am not sure if that would be correct either. Maybe `app.baseInitialize()` can be moved up a bit instead?\r\n\r\nThis bug was resolved by moving the signalinterrupt object from the kernel context to the node context and initializing it earlier. Also by abstracting this code and having it call interfaces::Node::startShutdown()\r\n",

But perhaps that would be overly relying on the implementation of `SignalInterrupt`.\r\n\r\nYes, that is the reasoning. There is an interface for sending the signal that returns success or failure, and I want this code to just call the interface without making assumptions about how the signal is sent. The way the signal is sent could change in the future if #10102 progresses and code running in separate processes. If this log print is a problem I can replace it with an Assert. But I think just making the call and logging an error when the call fails is the most straightforward approach.",

It's verbose and quite difficult to parse. These shutdown failures aren't really related to the callsite, and it looks like mostly we just log and then ignore them anyway.\r\n\r\nThis is intentional. The problem is that we have low-level code scattered in the codebase that is able to send shutdown signals, and this is not a good design. Lower level code should just be returning errors and notifications, and high level code should be using that information to decide whether to shut down, not reacting to shutdowns that could be triggered anywhere. The fact that bad code sending shutdown signals is more verbose now does not seem a problem, since code like this shoudl be discouraged and cleaned up anyway. This PR takes a step in that direction by removing the global `StartShutdown` function and discouraging more code like this from being written in the future.\r\n\r\nAnother thing this PR is trying to do is add appropriate error handling when sending shutdown signals fails, instead of crashing or ignoring the failures. The right way to handle these errors depends on where the errors happen. If an error happens in the `stop` RPC, an error should be returned to the RPC caller. If the error happens in a windows ctrl-c handler, the handler should log the failure and return false. If the error happens in a unix signal handler, the only thing that can be done without triggering undefined behavior is to ignore it. The problem with the suggested `use-cbs` branch is that it doesn't treat different errors differently. I think also it complicates control flow without a good justification. It is true that `[[nodiscard]] bool` error handling is a little verbose, but it's also more straightforward than `std::function` callbacks. And the verbosity can go away if more code changed to send status information instead of shutdown signals, which is something that should happen anyway.",

The name `shutdown` describes the purpose of the signal. But in lower level code _receiving_ the signal the signal is just called `interrupt` because the only thing this code needs to do is stop processing and return when the signal is received. It should not know why the signal is being sent.\r\n\r\nFor example in indexing code right now the interrupt signal is only sent when the node is shut down, but in the future indexes could be enabled, interrupted, and disabled at runtime by RPC or GUI commands without requiring a shutdown. In validation code, the interrupt signal is currently sent when the node is shuttting down, but in the future, the signal could be sent when there is no node at all and the signal is just being sent by a user of the libbitcoinkernel library to stop an operation.\r\n\r\nSo the variable used to request shutdowns is called `shutdown` and the variables used to receive interruptions are called `interrupt` because the variables are being used for different things. The variables could actually have different types, but since `SignalInterrupt` is modeled off of `CThreadInterrupt` just one type is used.",

This should be fixed now by passing a shutdown callback and delaying the call to app.node(). I didn't want to move the createNode call, because the interfaces::Node object is intentionally created after the splash screen, so the splash screen can show up without a delay. The delay wouldn't be significant now, but with #10102 creating the node requires an IPC round trip, so might be noticeable.\r\n\r\nAlso agree with you it's a shame this part of the Qt codebase doesn't have CI test coverage. Your suggestion to add a CI step starting and stopping bitcoin-qt on windows (and probably all platforms bitcoin-qt is built for) would be a nice thing to implement. I think it would be most easily implemented as a python test.\r\n\r\nOther ways to get more test coverage for this code might be to change one of the existing CI jobs to run existing python tests with `bitcoin-qt` instead of `bitcoind`. Or to refactor the GuiMain function and write unit tests for it. But unlike your suggestion, these approaches would be unlikely to trigger this particular bug since it is windows-specific.",

Why not keep the abort?\r\n\r\nIn general, I don't think dumping core is a good way to handle errors. I think it can be a reasonable thing to do if inconsistent internal state is detected or if a precondition is violated, and halting right away will provide better debug information. Or it could make sense if it's likely that data corruption or other bad outcomes will happen if execution doesn't stop as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nBut in this case when an ordinary system call that is not saving data returns an error code, I think it it is better to log the failure and move on than to crash the entire process abruptly when we don't know what other threads are running, what wallets might be loaded, what data might be lost, etc, as a result of an abort().",

Logically init.h and init.cpp belong in node subdirectory and should use the node namespace, so I didn't want to make this one function stand out. The function also does need to be located in this file because it is accesses a static variable. So just keeping the Init functions in the same namespace seemed like the most straightforward approach for now.",
