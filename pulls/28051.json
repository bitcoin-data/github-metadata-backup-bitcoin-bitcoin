    "body": "This change drops `shutdown.h` and `shutdown.cpp` files, replacing them with a `NodeContext::shutdown` member which is used to trigger shutdowns directly. This gets rid of an unnecessary layer of indirection, and allows getting rid of the `kernel::g_context` global.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR tries to improve error handling of `SignalInterrupt` code by marking relevant methods `[[nodiscard]]` to avoid the possibility of uncaught exceptions mentioned https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27861#discussion_r1255496707.\r\n\r\nBehavior is changing In a few cases which are noted in individual commit messages. Particularly: GUI code more consistently interrupts RPCs when it is shutting down, shutdown state no longer persists between unit tests, the stop RPC now returns an RPC error if requesting shutdown fails instead of aborting, and other failed shutdown calls now log errors instead of aborting.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a net reduction in lines of code, but in some cases the explicit error handling and lack of global shutdown functions do make it more verbose. The verbosity can be seen as good thing if it discourages more code from directly triggering shutdowns, and instead encourages code to return errors or send notifications that could be translated into shutdowns. Probably a number of existing shutdown calls could just be replaced by better error handling.",

step, running it manually with \r\n\r\n```bash\r\ntest/functional/create_cache.py --cachedir=test/cache --tmpdir=/tmp/cache\r\n```\r\n\r\nseems to succeed.\r\n\r\nI also found that if I ran `src/bitcoind -regtest` and `src/bitcoin-cli -regtest stop`, shutdown would work, but with the tsan warnings, which I'll try to debug:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nWARNING: ThreadSanitizer: data race

It's a fairly extensive PR to review, and the changes don't always help with verbosity (e.g. `(!(*Assert(Assert(m_context)->shutdown))())` instead of `StartShutdown`), but it seems like the right direction to go regardless.\r\n\r\nI've gone through the code multiple times now and it looks good, so I don't think I'll come up with (m)any more comments, but I'm not fully comfortable yet with all the implications of the changes so I'll have to spend some more time on it before signing off. Will try to do that in the next few days.",

How about adding a try-catch block in the various `MakeNodeInit` that populates the correct `exit_status` and returns a `nullptr`?\r\n\r\nThis is not a good place to handle exceptions, because this function is intended to be called by `interfaces::Init` constructors, and in constructors exceptions are a more natural error handling mechanism than return codes. The best thing to do here is let any exception bubble up, and the best place to catch exceptions would be around the `interfaces::MakeNodeInit` and `interfaces::MakeGuiInit` functions (which can already throw `bad_alloc`) which call this.\r\n\r\nExceptions are not currently caught around the `interfaces::MakeNodeInit` and `interfaces::MakeGuiInit` calls and I do not think it would make sense to change that now. These calls are the very first calls that get made in the `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` `main()` functions before anything else happens: before any threads are created, before any libraries are initialized, even before any command line arguments are parsed. So it should be impossible for these functions to fail unless the operating environment is unusable, and if they do fail there is no cleanup or logging that could be done, and it would be doubtful if even printing would work. So there would only by drawbacks trying to intercept the failure there as well. \r\n\r\nBasically this is a long way of saying if core dumps are enabled by the OS, it would be safe and appropriate to core dump here.",

This may be possible to trigger when running the GUI before the kernel context is initialized with `app.baseInitialize()`. We could just move it to after `baseInitialize` (see my [patch here](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commit/2df7a669a07be01ef2cce0d22891617bc19060d7)), but I am not sure if that would be correct either. Maybe `app.baseInitialize()` can be moved up a bit instead?\r\n\r\nThis bug was resolved by moving the signalinterrupt object from the kernel context to the node context and initializing it earlier. Also by abstracting this code and having it call interfaces::Node::startShutdown()\r\n",

These handlers are registered in `AppInitBasicSetup`. But if you look in bitcoind.cpp, the kernel context is created after `AppInitBasicSetup` is called.\r\n\r\nYes this is now fixed by having ctrl-c and signal handler use a g_shutdown global instead of using the kernel context.\r\n",

RPC calls should be interrupted whenever the GUI is shut down, regardless of how it is shut down. Calls to `StartShutdown` in GUI code were replaced with calls to `interfaces::Node::startShutdown` a long time ago, and I think this call was just missed because the replacement was done by searching for gui->node link symbol dependencies in a non-windows build, and this file is windows-only.",

There is an interface for sending the signal that returns success or failure, and I want this code to just call the interface without making assumptions about how the signal is sent. The way the signal is sent could change in the future if #10102 progresses and code running in separate processes. If this log print is a problem I can replace it with an Assert. But I think just making the call and logging an error when the call fails is the most straightforward approach.",

It's verbose and quite difficult to parse. These shutdown failures aren't really related to the callsite, and it looks like mostly we just log and then ignore them anyway.\r\n\r\nThis is intentional. The problem is that we have low-level code scattered in the codebase that is able to send shutdown signals, and this is not a good design. Lower level code should just be returning errors and notifications, and high level code should be using that information to decide whether to shut down, not reacting to shutdowns that could be triggered anywhere. The fact that bad code sending shutdown signals is more verbose now does not seem a problem, since code like this shoudl be discouraged and cleaned up anyway. This PR takes a step in that direction by removing the global `StartShutdown` function and discouraging more code like this from being written in the future.\r\n\r\nAnother thing this PR is trying to do is add appropriate error handling when sending shutdown signals fails, instead of crashing or ignoring the failures. The right way to handle these errors depends on where the errors happen. If an error happens in the `stop` RPC, an error should be returned to the RPC caller. If the error happens in a windows ctrl-c handler, the handler should log the failure and return false. If the error happens in a unix signal handler, the only thing that can be done without triggering undefined behavior is to ignore it. The problem with the suggested `use-cbs` branch is that it doesn't treat different errors differently. I think also it complicates control flow without a good justification. It is true that `[[nodiscard]] bool` error handling is a little verbose, but it's also more straightforward than `std::function` callbacks. And the verbosity can go away if more code changed to send status information instead of shutdown signals, which is something that should happen anyway.",

The name `shutdown` describes the purpose of the signal. But in lower level code _receiving_ the signal the signal is just called `interrupt` because the only thing this code needs to do is stop processing and return when the signal is received. It should not know why the signal is being sent.\r\n\r\nFor example in indexing code right now the interrupt signal is only sent when the node is shut down, but in the future indexes could be enabled, interrupted, and disabled at runtime by RPC or GUI commands without requiring a shutdown. In validation code, the interrupt signal is currently sent when the node is shuttting down, but in the future, the signal could be sent when there is no node at all and the signal is just being sent by a user of the libbitcoinkernel library to stop an operation.\r\n\r\nSo the variable used to request shutdowns is called `shutdown` and the variables used to receive interruptions are called `interrupt` because the variables are being used for different things. The variables could actually have different types, but since `SignalInterrupt` is modeled off of `CThreadInterrupt` just one type is used.",

This should be fixed now by passing a shutdown callback and delaying the call to app.node(). I didn't want to move the createNode call, because the interfaces::Node object is intentionally created after the splash screen, so the splash screen can show up without a delay. The delay wouldn't be significant now, but with #10102 creating the node requires an IPC round trip, so might be noticeable.\r\n\r\nAlso agree with you it's a shame this part of the Qt codebase doesn't have CI test coverage. Your suggestion to add a CI step starting and stopping bitcoin-qt on windows (and probably all platforms bitcoin-qt is built for) would be a nice thing to implement. I think it would be most easily implemented as a python test.\r\n\r\nOther ways to get more test coverage for this code might be to change one of the existing CI jobs to run existing python tests with `bitcoin-qt` instead of `bitcoind`. Or to refactor the GuiMain function and write unit tests for it. But unlike your suggestion, these approaches would be unlikely to trigger this particular bug since it is windows-specific.",

It also makes the shutdown monitor class more future-proof so it the WM_QUERYENDSESSION / WM_ENDSESSION code shouldn't need to change when there are changes to the node interface.",

Why not keep the abort?\r\n\r\nIn general, I don't think dumping core is a good way to handle errors. I think it can be a reasonable thing to do if inconsistent internal state is detected or if a precondition is violated, and halting right away will provide better debug information. Or it could make sense if it's likely that data corruption or other bad outcomes will happen if execution doesn't stop as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nBut in this case when an ordinary system call that is not saving data returns an error code, I think it it is better to log the failure and move on than to crash the entire process abruptly when we don't know what other threads are running, what wallets might be loaded, what data might be lost, etc, as a result of an abort().",

Otherwise it will have to be touched again when it is moved into the node namespace later?\r\n\r\nThis is true, but it is not different from other init.h methods. Logically init.h and init.cpp belong in node subdirectory and should use the node namespace, so I didn't want to make this one function stand out. The function also does need to be located in this file because it is accesses a static variable. So just keeping the Init functions in the same namespace seemed like the most straightforward approach for now.",
