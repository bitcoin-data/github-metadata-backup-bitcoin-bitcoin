Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nIf I'm not, seems like better behaviour might be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n     if (m_reopen_file) {\r\n          m_reopen_file = false;\r\n          FILE* new_fileout = fopen(m_file_path, \"a\");\r\n          if (!new_fileout) {\r\n               // release m_file_mutex first\r\n               LogPrintf(\"Failed to reopen log file %s\\n\", m_file_path);\r\n          } else {\r\n               fflush(m_fileout);\r\n               fclose(m_fileout);\r\n               m_fileout = new_fileout;\r\n          }\r\n     }\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Would it make sense to do StartShutdown() if logging stops working?)",
