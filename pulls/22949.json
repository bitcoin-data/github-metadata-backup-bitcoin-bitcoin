    "body": "When calculating the fee for a feerate, it is possible that the final calculation will have fractional satoshis. Currently those are ignored via truncation which results in the absolute fee being rounded down. Rounding down is problematic because it results in a feerate that is slightly lower than the feerate represented by the `CFeeRate` object. A slightly lower feerate particularly causes issues for coin selection as it can trigger an assertion error. To avoid potentially underpaying the feerate (and the assertion), always round up the calculated fee.\r\n\r\nA test is added for the assertion, along with a comment explaining what happens.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that a user can trigger this as it requires a very specific set of rounding errors to occur as well as the transaction not needing any change and being right on the lower bound of the exact match window. However I was able to trigger the assertion while running coin selection simulations, albeit after thousands of transactions and with some weird feerates.",

      "body": "> I don't think it's true in all cases. Take clawback tx A with fee such as it would be rounded up after this PR, not before. The application wants to replace it with clawback tx B with fee equal to `A's fee + incremental relay fee` such as it would not be rounded up.\r\n> Before this PR tx B would be accepted, after it would be refused.\r\n\r\nHow so? Can you provide a example? I can't think of how that would happen. `CFeeRate::GetFee` is never called on the original feerate in validation, and the calculation of a feerate for a transaction is not changed by this PR.\r\n\r\nConsider the example I give in the test: tx A is a 1-in-1-out 110 vbyte tx that pays a feerate of 1.85 sat/vbyte for an absolute fee if 203.5 sats. With rounding down, A will pay 203 sats. We replace this with tx B where the only thing different is the output, but it is of the same type so the size remains the same. Paying the incremental relay fee should be enough for B to replace A. The incremental feerate is 1 sat/vbyte, so regardless of rounding, it is always 110 sats. So B pays 313 sats.\r\n\r\nWhen validating whether B is allowed to replace A, it needs to pass two fee related checks: [`PaysMoreThanConflicts`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/policy/rbf.cpp#L124) (called [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L785)) and [`PaysForRBF`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/policy/rbf.cpp#L150) (called [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L806)). `PaysMoreThanConflicts` computes the feerates for A and B and just checks that B's feerate is greater than A's. The rounding of computing the feerate given the fee paid and size **did not change**, so both before and after this PR, the calculation for A is `203 * 1000 / 110 = 1845`. The calculation for B is `313 * 1000 / 110 = 2845`. B's feerate is greater than A's, so this check passes, both before and after this PR. `PaysForRBF` checks that the fees for B is greater than A. Then it checks that the difference is not less than the incremental relay fee. Because the incremental relay fee is an integer, the calculation before and after this PR is the same - 110 sats.\r\n\r\nAt no point in this checking process is the original feerate of 1.85 sats/vbyte used because validation does not know that was the original targeted feerate. The only times where validation calls `CFeeRate::GetFee` is to calculate the fee at the minimum relay feerate and the incremental relay feerate, both of which have integers as their default, so their calculations do not change. So I don't see how this change would have any effect on whether transactions are accepted.",

Currently, it's rounded down to 203 sats. After this PR, it will be rounded up to 204 sats.\r\n\r\nNote, I think `GetFee` is called in few subsystems beyond mempool acceptance and wallet. Such as for block construction (`addPackageTxs`) or transaction announcement selection (L4802, in `src/net_processing`). As the pair of transactions is equally affected, I don't think the comparison is altered. I.e if transaction A was 203.5 sats and transaction B was 204.5 sats, respectivelly rounded down to 203 sats and 204 sats, now they will be rounded up to 204 sats and 205 sats ? The comparison should hold. AFAICT, the proposed change doesn't have positive or negative impacts on transaction propagation or block building.\r\n\r\n(Though if it's change the displayed absolute fee at the interface-level, I think a release note would be appropriate, a user could consume the now-rounded up result and do a comparison with a still-rounded down result from another software than Core in a way which is obscure to us ?)",

Most of them would be terrible due to huge excess and hence waste, so another solution would be chosen. But in some cases excess higher than upper bound would be\r\neconomically optimal based on waste metric.\r\n\r\nThis change also makes transaction building and waste calculation consistent. Specifically it eliminates two sources of discrepancy: \r\n\r\n1. for knapsack we used to always calculate waste as if they produce change (that's not always true)\r\n2. change could be dropped to fees during tx building after waste is calculated \r\n\r\nAs a result we should see more changeless solutions which is good for: privacy, utxo set, total fees paid.

However, the other failures reported there cannot be explained by this, so this is just a partial fix.",

Fees are discrete values, so a fixed precision decimal representation makes sense for absolute fees. Feerates are continuous values (ratio of the discrete values, rational numbers) so any floating or fractional representation makes sense and while error feedback about being out of range would be useful, error feedback about being too precise would be strange.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is just a drive-by review comment so feel free to ignore, but the math here converting between `'0.00000001'` string literals and `1e8` floating point literals, and decimal objects, long integer objects plus use of a `satoshi_round` function that is rounding down when you are trying to round up seems overcomplicated even if it is correct. If I were trying to write this in the most readable way I would probably do all the math with python long integers and a [`ceildiv`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14822184/is-there-a-ceiling-equivalent-of-operator-in-python) helper, and just return a Decimal object at the end.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef ceildiv(a, b):\r\n    return -(-a // b)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA `ceildiv` function would probably also simplify the c++ code, though the implementation in c++ would be different (something like `(a + b - 1) / b`)\r\n",

This function is only used by `assert_fee_amount` which is should be convenient for developers and make tests readable. I don't know if it's make tests more readable to be able to write fees as `feerate_btc_kvb` and have this automatic conversion, or to write fees as `feerate_sat_kvb` and avoid the need for this conversion. I just don't think it's a bug for the conversion to accept fractional feerates since they do make sense conceptually and since this line isn't really trying to emulate anything in bitcoin core.",
