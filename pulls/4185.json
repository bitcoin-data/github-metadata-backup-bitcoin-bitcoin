    "body": "This is a set of descriptors for building an OSX DMG without the need for OSX. The descriptors are quite large and unruly, but this seemed like the most reasonable first step towards releasing builds created this way.\n\nThese have been ported to monolithic descriptors from the work done in my repo here:\nhttps://github.com/theuni/osx-cross-depends/\n\nI've included a Readme that attempts to cover the most obvious questions. After some major changes in the last week, the process is actually rather clean now and contains very few nasty hacks. The exception to that is cctools, which is... gross. See the readme for details.\n\nUnfortunately my macbook completely died yesterday (new one is on the way), so I'm unable to help with testing until next week. Though I've made no major functional changes since then (worked fine as of yesterday), so I'm confident that the resulting installer is in good shape. Much testing is needed, of course.\n\nThere are still plenty of warts in the process, and I have plans for addressing them. As discussed with @laanwj, this is intended to be only the first step.\n",

If its contents were packaged into the resulting builds, that would mean that every output tarball would end up tainted. Instead, I chose to add it as an input requirement for each step so that there's no risk of output contamination.\n\nWith the understanding that it's needed for each dependency (except for dmg/genisoimage i suppose), do you have a way in mind to wall it off further?\n",

Following exactly, you'd get `gitian-builder/inputs/inputs/`.\n- The actual mac build part is missing from release-process.md.\n- How come this uses tarballs for the intermediate inputs (deps) and not zips like the rest of them? I mean, I assume it doesn't matter in theory, but a) consistency is nice, and b) it gives an easy way to distinguish at a glance between sources (tarballs) and built deps (zips).\n- How come protobuf and boost aren't their own descriptors like they are for Windows?\n- It would probably be preferable to name the descriptors and intermediate files similar to the current ones: deps-osx.yml, qt-osx.yml, bitcoin-deps-*, etc.\n  - Maybe using \"osx32\" in the file names to match linux/win?\n",

I've asked him to create a separate PR for bumping the win32 version to match.\n\n@Michagogo I addressed some of your comments, but have left some alone in the interest of saving time. It's going to take a release process to get the real instructions nailed down, so I'd rather not focus on that just yet. It'd be great if you could PR any fixups you think are necessary after the bulk of these changes go in.\n\nThe determinism issues that warren pointed out in #4189 were related to mixing osx/win32/linux environments, which is beyond this scope of this PR. These descriptors work and supplements to address that can come later.\n\nThe configure loop is caused by a rare race, and it can be fixed as @laanwj suggested by moving the faketime to a more narrow scope. I'm aware of the issue and will address it soon. It doesn't affect the end-result though, so I don't think it's necessary to hold on the fix.\n\nThe last piece in the puzzle is codesigning. We discussed a few possibilities at the conference and I'm working on that now.\n",
