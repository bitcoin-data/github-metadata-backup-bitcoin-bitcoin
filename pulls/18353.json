It could look better if the ScrollArea used the same style as its surroundings instead of the tan background, but I'm not sure how to do that.\r\n\r\nPartial #15747: Makes small missed changes to #14957 (VM_Staged). Also, I can make analagous changes for the dash specific Get*Balance functions if that sounds like a good addition.",
