          "body": "This is the third part of Qt/Gui related PRs being backported from Bitcoin to Dash.\r\n\r\nI tried to stick with modal overlay related PRs, but also included some PRs which contain changes later touched by the overlay related PRs.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes parts of the network activity toggle I mentioned [here](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/pull/1615#issuecomment-328062535). I added a commit on top of that PR to revert the functionality of the network status icon, so that it keeps opening the peers list instead of toggling network state. This means, that for now it's only possible to toggle network status with the new RPC call setnetworkactive. Later we may add a context menu to the status icon which gives an option to toggle network status. At that point we should probably also replace the network disabled icon to something that fits to the style of the Dash network status.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9218 also introduced the ClickableLabel which was then used for the network toggle and the sync spinner icon. While reverting the changes to the network status icon, I decided to also use the ClickableLabel for the status icon (removes the QPushButton flat button + style handling, making future backporting easier).\r\n\r\nWith this backport PR merged, we have all the functionality of the modal overlay from Bitcoin 0.14. The remaining backports that I'll do are not related to the overlay, and thus can be postponed to later (after the next releast).\r\n",
