I propose that for future use, \"cmpctblock\" be restricted to the actual debug's relating to creation/etc of compact blocks, but for the transmission and download that block{,2} etc be used (since \"block\", \"tx\" are subsets of \"net\"). Sound ok?\n\nRegarding rule of thumb, happy to do this (perhaps in a future pull) - best put into init.cpp or into a readme file somewhere?\n",
