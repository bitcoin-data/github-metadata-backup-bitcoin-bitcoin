    "body": "Since the release of 0.10.0, we've seen several reports of failed sanity tests due to failing to catch basic exceptions. At the moment, Debian Wheezy fails to run the official Linux binary, and FreeBSD fails to run when compiled natively. I assume that there are several other broken setups as well.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the brokenness is always due to type_info visibility. Building with -fvisibility=hidden can cause problems with old/busted stdlibs. See [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19664) for some background.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to tell (without blacklisting std libs like we already do with boost) if libstdc++ is going to play nice with --enable-reduce-exports. Rather than trying, just disable it by default. Packagers can re-enable if it's known to be safe.\n\nFor Linux, when compiling against a new libstdc++ but using an older one at runtime, exceptions can again be missed. Rather than take any chances, use -static-libstdc++. This means we don't have to worry about trying to maintain a compat wrapper.\n\nBinaries become slightly bigger (about 1M each), but not enough to worry about imo. The final compressed sizes:\n\n```\nbefore:\n17416   built/linux/bitcoin-0.10.0-linux32.tar.gz\n17196   built/linux/bitcoin-0.10.0-linux64.tar.gz\n```\n\n```\nafter:\n18920   build/out/bitcoin-0.10.99-linux32.tar.gz\n18804   build/out/bitcoin-0.10.99-linux64.tar.gz\n```\n\nDebian Wheezy is verified fixed. @koobs has verified that building without reduced exports fixes freebsd.\n",

So eventually this won't be much of a problem (or it will be replaced with newer problems...).\n\nBut more to your point, I suppose I've explained the changes here poorly. For our official releases, we still build with hidden symbols as before, we just also link libstdc++ statically. The change here in that regard is that --disable-reduced-exports becomes the default in our configure... builders can re-enable if they'd like (as we do). So it should be effectively a no-op as far as official release symbol visibility goes.\n",

As an initial data point, it appears to run fine on Debian Wheezy (where it was broken before).\n\nThinking through it a bit...\nbitcoin-qt's own throw/catch usage should be fine because the exception types are defined internally. Qt's throw/catch usage should be fine because their types are dynamically loaded, and we don't export them.\n\nI think the worrisome case would be if qt throws us a std::exception. In that case, I'm really not sure what definition is used. Though from a quick grep, it looks like that never happens.\n\nThat's all conjecture though. I'd like to have hard evidence. Beyond expanding our sanity checks to other std exceptions, can you think of other tests we could add here?\n",

      "body": "@theuni Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. I'm not only worried about exceptions, but as I see it this will result in Qt and bitcoin-qt using different versions of libstdc++. The two versions of libstdc++ may have slightly different interpretations of types. When stdc++ types are passed across the dynamic library barrier (for example for QString::fromStdStding) this could cause potential issues. Another potential cause of issues are global data structures in libstdc++.\n\nI know this is a common issue on Windows, at least. Maybe there is some magic workaround, but it seems brittle to me. A way to invite unknown unknowns. Hence I'm not so much convinced by 'it happens to work on X'.\n\nThe recommendation when statically linking libstdc++ statically is to also link all c++ libraries statically. See e.g. http://www.trilithium.com/johan/2005/06/static-libstdc . Dynamic linking of C libraries is fine.\n\n> For Linux, when compiling against a new libstdc++ but using an older one at runtime\n- The caveman solution that comes to mind is: build against an old libstdc++.\n- Or should we bite the bullet and link Qt statically. More and more that sounds like the only robust solution (remember the OpenSSL interop issues). Static qt5 sucks on Ubuntu, but that is cosmetic and preferable to these kinds of issues.\n",
