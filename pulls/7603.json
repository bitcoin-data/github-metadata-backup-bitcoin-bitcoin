InstallDir wasn't replaced because the current text has an uppercase B, and I'm not sure of a good way to capitalize the result of PACKAGE_TARNAME.\n3. A comment in the Main Installer section wasn't replaced because comments don't ever face the end user.\n4. The registry value \"URL:Bitcoin\" wasn't replaced for the same reason as InstallDir.\n5. Startup shortcut wasn't replaced for the same reason as InstallDir.\n\nAll other appearances of \"bitcoin\" in the NSIS script were replaced.\n",

      "body": "@laanwj Yes, agreed that flexibility is important here.  However, is there a loss in flexibility if a forked project has to change \"$PACKAGE_TARNAME\" to something else in the four binary name variables, rather than changing \"bitcoin\" to something else in the same variables?  I'm definitely not arguing that those four variables should be removed, I just think it makes sense for their default values to be dependent on PACKAGE_TARNAME since that seems to be a common configuration.  Any forked project that wants the binary filename prefixes to be something other than PACKAGE_TARNAME can change them just as easily as changing them away from being \"bitcoin\".  So I don't see a loss of flexibility -- am I missing something?\n",

InstallDir wasn't replaced because the current text has an uppercase B, and I'm not sure of a good way to capitalize the result of PACKAGE_TARNAME.\n3. A comment in the Main Installer section wasn't replaced because comments don't ever face the end user.\n4. The registry value \"URL:Bitcoin\" wasn't replaced for the same reason as InstallDir.\n5. Startup shortcut wasn't replaced for the same reason as InstallDir.\n\nAll other appearances of \"bitcoin\" were replaced with PACKAGE_TARNAME, except for the bin names, which were instead replaced with the new bin name autoconf variables.",
