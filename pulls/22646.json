    "body": "This PR more tightly integrates building Univalue into our build system. This follows the same approach we use for [LevelDB](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb/), ([`Makefile.leveldb.include`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/Makefile.leveldb.include)), and [CRC32C](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/crc32c) ([`Makefile.crc32c.include`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/Makefile.crc32c.include)), and will be the same approach we use for [minisketch](https://github.com/sipa/minisketch); see #23114.\r\n\r\nThis approach yields a number of benefits, including:\r\n* Faster configuration due to one less subconfigure being run during `./configure` i.e 22s with this PR vs 26s\r\n* Faster autoconf i.e 13s with this PR vs 17s\r\n* Improved caching\r\n* No more issues with compiler flags i.e https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12467\r\n* More direct control means we can build exactly the objects we want\r\n\r\nThere might be one argument against making this change, which is that builders should have the option to use \"proper shared/system libraries\". However, I think that falls down for a few reasons. The first being that we already don't support building with a number of system libraries (secp256k1, leveldb, crc32c); some for good reason. Univalue is really the odd one out at the moment. \r\n\r\nNote that the only fork of Core I'm aware of, that actively patches in support for using system libs, also explicitly marks them as [\"DANGEROUS\"](https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin/blob/a886811721ce66eb586871706b3f5dd27518ac3e/configure.ac#L1430) and [\"NOT SUPPORTED\"](https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin/blob/a886811721ce66eb586871706b3f5dd27518ac3e/configure.ac#L1312). So it would seem they exist more to satisfy a distro requirement, as opposed to something that anyone should, or would actually use in practice.\r\n\r\nPRs like #22412 highlight the \"issue\" with us operating with our own Univalue fork, where we actively fix bugs, and make improvements, when upstream (https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue) may not be taking those improvements, and by all accounts, is not currently actively maintained. Bitcoin Core should not be hamstrung into not being able to fix bugs in a library, and/or have to litter our source with \"workarounds\", i.e #22412, for bugs we've already fixed, based on the fact that an upstream project is not actively being maintained. Allowing builders to use system libs is really only exacerbating this problem, with little benefit to our project. Bitcoin Core is not quite like your average piece of distro packaged software.\r\n\r\nThere is the potential for us to give the same treatment to libsecp256k1, however it seems doing that is currently less straightforward.",

Being able to build with a system univalue library really doesn't provide any benefit to users, but results in issues like #22412 which suck up reviewer and maintainer time. Maintaining support for different versions of univalue also expands the matrix of different build/configuration combinations which we really should (but don't) test if we claim support.",

      "body": "I know that the forking process already began before this PR, and I think that forking in open source can be very good. But I also think that when you fork, it is better practically and ethically to _rename the fork_. In the case of a library, this doesn't need to involve renaming functions and classes in the library, but the forked library should at least have different library filenames (`libunivalue.a`) and include filenames (in this case just `univalue.h`) so it is not a nightmare if downstream projects have code requiring both libraries as dependencies. Also it would be good to rename the source directory [`src/univalue/`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/univalue) and update the readme documentation [`src/univalue/README.md`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/univalue/README.md) to explicity say the library has been forked, the forks are incompatible, problems and discussions about the fork should be directed at the new issue tracker / mailing list / irc channel / whatever, not at the original project.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that by renaming a directory and two files, you can make things less ambiguous, confusing, and potentially painful for downstream developers, while also being kinder to the author of the original library and letting the name he chose for his project refer unambiguously to his own project instead of a collection of forks.\r\n\r\nAs for what name to substitute, for an internal fork it could be nonsense like _xyzlkq_ for all it matters, or something like _unibtc_ to be coherent, or something ike _jsonvalue_ to be descriptive, or something like _univalue--_ to be cheeky, whatever.\r\n\r\nPlease ignore this suggestion if it's too cumbersome. Just wanted to describe a possible way to make forking less confusing and contentious.",

Just wanted to de scribe a possible way to make forking less confusing and contentious.\r\n\r\nNot sure about this. As said in the OP, we have done a similar thing for the `leveldb` and `crc32c` libraries with regard to maintaining our own fork without renaming them. The subsequent repositories have a mention in their github description that they are not the upstream project, this may be enough. To be clear, it is **not** the intent that other projects use our fork of the library, it is for our subtree use only. Nor is it intended for them to be packaged (e.g. in Linux distributions). Renaming the project might give a false signal that it's an independent project for general use, somehow.\r\n\r\n(Also AFAIK we do still intend to follow upstream changes, and contributing changes upstream, even though they only get merged intermittently if at all, I think it's better regarded as a patch stack on top than a completely separate project)",

Using the system UniValue isn't and shouldn't not be dangerous nor unsupported.\r\n\r\nThere is basically no reason to embed a copy of UniValue at all. If upstream support is lacking, we should just release our fork as a proper fork of the library or not require things upstream has decided not to do. The embedded copy should ideally be removed, and only ever build against the system install.\r\n\r\nOther disagree with removing the embedded copy, however. Keeping support for both system *and* an embedded copy was a reasonable compromise. If we're not going to support both, however, the direction to go is removing the embedded copy, not dropping support for the correct configuration (system library).",

Thanks fanquake for keeping this going.\r\n\r\n> There is the potential for us to give the same treatment to libsecp256k1, however it seems doing that is currently less straightforward.\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion in #secp256k1, this probably isn't going to happen. It would require us to essentially copy/paste secp256k1's configure since it deals with c as opposed to c++. I proposed wrapping secp256k1 in a .cpp, but that idea was NACK'd quickly by the upstream maintainers. So I think that subconfigure will probably stay as-is.",

In regards to the comments earlier in this PR, we've done some work to make it more clear that our fork is an internal (for our use only) subtree, by renaming the repository, and I've also opened a PR to adjust the README to mention that our API has diverged from upstream: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/univalue-subtree/pull/30.\r\n\r\n> After some discussion in #secp256k1, this probably isn't going to happen.\r\n\r\nThat is slightly disappointing, but at least now we'll be down to only a single extra configure invocation.\r\n\r\nEdit: @theuni note that I modified your comment to remove my @ mention so that it wouldn't be included in the merge message.",
