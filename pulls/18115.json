    "body": "Following #17261, the way to sign transactions, PSBTs, and messages was to use `GetSigningProvider()` and get a `SigningProvider` containing the private keys. However this may not be feasible for future `ScriptPubKeyMan`s, such as for hardware wallets. Instead of exporting a `SigningProvider` containing private keys, we need to pass these things into the `ScriptPubKeyMan` (via `CWallet`) so that they can do whatever is needed internally to sign them. This is largely a refactor as the logic of processing transactions, PSBTs, and messages for is moved into `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` and `CWallet` instead of being handled by the caller (e.g. `signrawtransaction`).\r\n\r\nTo help with this, I've refactored the 3(!) implementations of a `SignTransaction()` function into one generic one. This function will be called by `signrawtransactionwithkey` and `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::SignTransaction()`. `CWallet::CreateTransaction()` is changed to call `CWallet::SignTransaction()` which in turn, calls `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::SignTransaction()`. Other `ScriptPubKeyMan`s may implement `SignTransaction()` differently.\r\n\r\n`FillPSBT()` is moved to be a member function of `CWallet` and the `psbtwallet.cpp/h` files removed. It is further split so that `CWallet` handles filling the UTXOs while the `ScriptPubKeyMan` handles adding keys, derivation paths, scripts, and signatures. In the end `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::FillPSBT` still calls `SignPSBTInput`, but the `SigningProvider` is internal to `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`. Other `ScriptPubKeyMan`s may do something different.\r\n\r\nA new `SignMessage()` function is added to both `CWallet` and `ScriptPubKeyMan`. Instead of having the caller (i.e. `signmessage` or the sign message dialog) get the private key, hash the message, and sign, `ScriptPubKeyMan` will now handle that (`CWallet` passes through to the `ScriptPubKeyMan`s as it does for many functions). This signing code is thus consolidated into `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::SignMessage()`, though other `ScriptPubKeyMan`s may implement it differently. Additionally, a `SigningError` enum is introduced for the different errors that we expect to see from `SignMessage()`.\r\n\r\nLastly, `GetSigningProvider()` is renamed to `GetPublicSigningProvider()`. It will now only provide pubkeys, key origins, and scripts. `LegacySigningProvider` has it's `GetKey` and `HaveKey` functions changed to only return false. Future implementations should return `HidingSigningProvider`s where private keys are hidden.\r\n\r\nOther things like `dumpprivkey` and `dumpwallet` are not changed because they directly need and access the `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` so are not relevant to future changes.",

It would be great if you reviewed that PR (if you already have, and still feel this is the right approach, I'd love to know why).\r\n\r\nYou can still have the message signing code unified to a single place, and in fact, this PR does that (it consolidates the `signmessage` RPC and the Sign Message dialog signing implementations). Each `ScriptPubKeyMan` can still call that single unified function from within it's own `SignMessage` function. But each one having it's own `SignMessage` also allows us to implement it differently depending on the `ScriptPubKeyMan`. In particular, for hardware wallets, we can't use the unified `SignMessage` function because that would require producing a `SigningProvider` containing private keys, which is not possible for hardware wallets. In order to sign anything with hardware wallets, we need to pass in the thing to be signed to the device and let it handle the signing rather than signing it ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis change means that a future `HardwareScriptPubKeyMan` can do exactly that: the message is passed into `HardwareScriptPubKeyMan::SignMessage` which then passes it along to the hardware wallet. This way, nothing external to the wallet needs to know that there is a hardware wallet or how to handle it. That can all be done within the `HardwareScriptPubKeyMan`.\r\n\r\n> The above code hits the assert. I.e. despite getting a signing provider for the destination, it still fails to get the key. This code (i.e. getting signing provider and then getting privkey from that) in current master.\r\n\r\nThat's because you are still using the old code and way of signing messages. There is no need for `signmessage` to get a `SigningProvider` anymore. Instead you should be implementing either within the `SignMessage` function that is now in `sign.cpp`. You'll probably need to change the arguments, but you shouldn't need to go to the specific call sites like `signmessage` or the Sign Message dialog.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the reason this hits the assert is that the `SigningProvider` that is returned only returns public keys and scripts. `GetKey` and `HaveKey` have been changed to always fail. Notice that the function named `GetSigningProvider` was renamed to `GetPublicSigningProvider`.",

When this `SignatureData` object gets passed into `ProduceSignature`, `ProduceSignature` first looks at the `SignatureData` finds an existing signatures, pubkeys, and scripts, and fills those into the transaction rather than asking for the `SigningProvider` (which is produced by the `ScriptPubKeyMan`). So even if that `SigningProvider` can't sign, because we already had signatures, pubkeys, and scripts in that transaction, no error occurs.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional optimization already in `ProduceSignature` which skips signing when it finds that `SignatureData.complete == true`, which is determined by doing a `VerifyScript` within `DataFromTransaction`. Hence signing is skipped for that input.\r\n\r\nAll of this is pre-existing code which allows us to sign a transaction with external inputs without error. The same process that we do internally with multiple `ScriptPubKeyMan`s is almost the same as if you signed a transaction that has inputs from multiple wallets with those different wallets. Errors are not given for the inputs that are already signed.",
