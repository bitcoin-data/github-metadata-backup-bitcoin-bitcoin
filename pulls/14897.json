    "body": "This code makes executing two particular (and potentially other) attacks harder.\r\n\r\n### InvBlock\r\nThis behavior was described well [here](https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/coinscope/coinscope.pdf) (page 11).\r\n\r\nPer current implementation, if node A receives _INV_ (tx) from node B, node A sends _GETDATA_ to B and waits for _TX_ message back.\r\n\r\nNode A is likely to receive more _INVs_ (regarding the same tx) from other peers. But node A would not send another _GETDATA_ unless it does not hear _TX_ back from node B for next 2 minutes (to save bandwidth)\r\n\r\nThus, if B is a malicious node, it can prevent node A from getting the transaction (even if all A’s peers have it) for 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis behavior seems to be an inherent limitation of the current P2P relay protocol, and I don’t see how it can be fundamentally changed (I can see workarounds which involve rewriting a lot of P2P code though).\r\n\r\n### What does this PR fix?\r\n\r\nThe attacks I’m looking at involve preventing A from learning the transaction for 2*N minutes. To do that, an attacker has to spin up N nodes and send N _INVs_ simultaneously to node A (then InvBlocks will be queued with an interval of 2 minutes according to current implementation)\r\n\r\nMore precisely, 2 scenarios I’m looking at are:\r\n1. An attacker censors a particular transaction. By performing InvBlock from different nodes, an attacker can execute a network-wide censorship of a particular transaction (or all transactions). The earlier an attacker founds the transaction he wants to censor, the easier it is to perform an attack. As it was pointed out by @gwillen, this is even more dangerous in the case of lightning, where transactions are known in advance. \r\n2. Topology inference described in papers [1](https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/coinscope/coinscope.pdf), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00942.pdf) involve network-wide InvBlock. This fix would not mitigate this type of inference, but I believe it will make it more expensive to perform (an attacker would have to create more transactions and perform more rounds to learn the topology, the second paper itself notes that InvBlock isolation is important for the attack).\r\n\r\n### How does it work\r\nThis PR introduces bias toward outbound connections (they have higher priority when a node chooses from whom it should request a transaction) and randomizes the order.\r\nAs per @gmaxwell suggestion, GETDATA requests queue is created after processing all incoming messages from all nodes. \r\n\r\nAfter this fix, if the incoming messages were [I1, I2, I3, O1, O2, O3, O4], the queue for _GETDATA_ may look like [O2, O1, O3, O4, I1, I3, I2, ….].\r\n\r\nIf {I1, I2, I3} were significantly earlier (but the difference is less than TX_TIMEOUT=60 s) than others, the queue for _GETDATA_ may look like [I2, O2, O1, O3, O4, I1, I3, ….]. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Other comments:\r\n1. This mitigation works better if the connectivity is higher (especially outbound, because it would be less likely that 2 _GETDATAs_ for inbound malicious nodes queued together)\r\n",

But how is this change randomizing which peer a transaction gets requested from?\r\n\r\nIt seems like the first request is scheduled based on inv time, and goes to the peer that announced first (with 1 second penalty for an incoming peer):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2f9abf746b3555ca8b47e8d0122bf4252396a7ff/src/net_processing.cpp#L669-L674\r\n\r\nAnd then subsequent requests all get scheduled at the same time based on the first request (again with penalty for incoming peers):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2f9abf746b3555ca8b47e8d0122bf4252396a7ff/src/net_processing.cpp#L3865-L3867\r\n\r\nSo the peer chosen will depend on the order of SendMessages() calls, which appears to be fixed, not random.\r\n\r\nVery possible I am missing something here, though.\r\n\r\nAs for the PR, I need to look more closely at the code, but in general it looks very good and the comments are great. It would be good to add a commit description and also credit Suhas if it's true this is \"heavily based\" on his work (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14897#issuecomment-454167958). I think if you add a\r\n\r\n```\r\nCo-authored-by: Suhas Daftuar <sdaftuar@gmail.com>\r\n```\r\n\r\nline to the end of your commit message it will list him as a coauthor in github.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> It would not randomize for outbound peers, because the request would be sent right after processMessage for a given peer\r\n\r\nThis is only true for the first request, right? After the first request, assuming it timed out, all the outbound peers would be scheduled to make the next request at the same time (`last_request_time + MAX_GETDATA_TX_DELAY`), and since SendMessages() seems to be called on peers in a stable order, which peer requested first would be fixed. This seems to contradict the PR description which says \"This PR introduces bias toward outbound connections (they have higher priority when a node chooses from whom it should request a transaction) and randomizes the order.\" Maybe you just need to drop the part about randomizing the order.\r\n\r\nI think I also need to look into how `SendMessages()` is called. It seems like if it were called in a predictable way, like once a second on all peers in a fixed order, then this code would just keep resending the transaction request to the first outbound peer after the initial request timed out, and never try any different peers, because every peer would schedule their next request at the exact same time, and the same peer would always be called first to actually send the request.",

Then, for A and other peers B, C we've heard the transaction from the next request time after the timeout will be t1=61. Then, m_tx_download.m_tx_process_time for peer A would not contain the tx anymore (it'd be in in_flight), and the choice between B and C will be random, because they're scheduled for the same time, and who knows which node's SendMessages will hit this timestamp first.\r\n\r\nWell, a bit not random, because Probability(B) > Probability(C) if the list is A B C D E F G H. But that's fine, because 1) outbound would be always prioritized; 2) An attacker cannot control this list.\r\n\r\nThus, I think we should not change anything (besides perhaps adding a little delay for outbound to not process right away, but that's not critical)",

Without the randomization you suggest, creating sybil inbound connections to a target node is quite pointless.\r\n\r\nIf we add this PoissonNextSend(2) to every *non-first* (I believe it does not make sense for first) request, it would make sense to create sybil inbounds, hope that one of them roll zero and get a 1-second delay (from penalty), while one (or N/8) outbound get 2-seconds delay on average (and there are currently only 8 outbound not all of which would know the tx under attack).\r\n\r\nThus, there is a trade-off. I think it is safe enough when penalty >= delay, so I'll make both of them 1 second for now. I will leave a comment about it as well.",

      "body": "All the code added in this chunk strikes me as logic that belongs in the `SendMessages()` function in `net_processing.cpp`, rather than in the message handling thread.\r\n\r\nThe split between what we do in `net.cpp` and what we do in `net_processing.cpp` isn't crystal clear, but my general sense is that we try to do application level behaviors in `net_processing.cpp`, and generic/low-level network logic in `net.cpp`.  When there's spillover between the two (such as when we need to store data in a `CNode` that feels like it belongs in `CNodeState` but for some reason it's tricky to do), then the split tends to be that `net.cpp` just handles the data storage, while the logic that uses it is in `net_processing.cpp`.\r\n\r\nSo adding logic directly to `ThreadMessageHandler` makes me vaguely uncomfortable -- the locking around CNode's can be tricky to get right, and so doing application-level things in here feels like the wrong design.\r\n\r\nI actually wonder if we could move all this transaction request logic (including the per-peer and per-txid storage) to be in `net_processing.cpp`, and do this all with `CNodeState`, rather than have inv storage kept in `CNode`?  If that's achievable, I think that would be a win overall.\r\n\r\n@TheBlueMatt or @theuni -- care to agree/disagree with what I wrote?\r\n",
