    "body": "This is also a much simpler replacement for #28327.\r\n\r\nThere are version fields in `CBlockLocator` and `CDiskBlockIndex` that have always been written but discarded when read.\r\n\r\nI intended to convert them to use SerParams as introduced by #25284, which [ended up looking like this](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/3e3af451652322c92e8e41cf918e69d608ec7c77). However because we don't currently have any definition of what a hash value would mean for either one of those, and we've never assigned the version field any meaning, I think it's better to just not worry about them.\r\n\r\nIf we ever need to assign meaning in the future, we can introduce `SerParams` as was done for `CAddress`.\r\n\r\nAs for the dummy values chosen:\r\n\r\n`CDiskBlockIndex::DUMMY_VERSION` was easy as the highest ever client version, and I don't expect any objection there.\r\n\r\n`CBlockLocator::DUMMY_VERSION` is hard-coded to the higest _PROTOCOL_ version ever used. This is to avoid a sudden bump that would be visible on the network if CLIENT_VERSION were used instead. In the future, if we ever need to use the value, we can discard anything in the CLIENT_VERSION range (for a few years as needed), as it's quite a bit higher.\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing, I suggest looking at the throwaway `SerParams` commit above as it shows where the call-sites are. I believe that should be enough to convince one's self that hashing is never used.",

It will need to be removed anyway, and it is already unused, so removing it should be correct, if it compiles.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK either way",
