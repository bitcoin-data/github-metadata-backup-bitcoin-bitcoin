    "body": "This PR fixes a recently discovered race condition in the self-connect detection (see #30362 and #30368).\r\n\r\nInitiating an outbound network connection currently involves the following steps after the socket connection is established (see [`CConnman::OpenNetworkConnection`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/bd5d1688b4311e21c0e0ff89a3ae02ef7d0543b8/src/net.cpp#L2923-L2930) method):\r\n1. set up node state\r\n2. queue VERSION message (both steps 1 and 2 happen in [`InitializeNode`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/bd5d1688b4311e21c0e0ff89a3ae02ef7d0543b8/src/net_processing.cpp#L1662-L1683))\r\n3. add new node to vector `m_nodes`\r\n    \r\nIf we connect to ourself, it can happen that the sent VERSION message (step 2) is received and processed locally *before* the node object is added to the connection manager's `m_nodes` vector (step 3). In this case, the self-connect remains undiscovered, as the detection doesn't find the outbound peer in `m_nodes` yet (see `CConnman::CheckIncomingNonce`).\r\n    \r\nFix this by swapping the order of 2. and 3., by taking the `PushNodeVersion` call out of `InitializeNode` and doing that in the `SendMessages` method instead, which is only called for `CNode` instances in `m_nodes`.\r\n\r\nThe temporarily reverted test introduced in #30362 is readded. Fixes #30368.\r\n\r\nThanks go to vasild, mzumsande and dergoegge for suggestions on how to fix this (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30368#issuecomment-2200625017 ff. and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30394#discussion_r1668290789).",

      "body": "I wonder if this could this lead to problems with \"non-shy\" software that would send VERSION immediately on incoming connections (which bitcoin core doesn't do thanks to Hal Finney's #101, but alternative clients might).\r\n\r\nWhen Bitcoin Core makes an outgoing connection after this patch, it won't send out the version message immediately, so it could receive a version message before sending one. In that case, I think that `ProcessMessage` could send out other messages (WTXIDRELAY etc.) before sending the version message, which would be a protocol violation.\r\n\r\nOne possible fix for this might be to not process messages of outbound peers before having sent the version message.\r\n\r\nI didn't test any of this, this is just from reading the code.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@mzumsande: Good catch! With that in my mind, I see the following paths forward:\r\n1. Queue outbound VERSION message immediately in `CConnman::OpenNetworkConnection` (as done in a previous version of this PR: https://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/tree/202407-p2p-fix_selfdetection_racecond_oldversion, extending the `NetEventsInterface` with a new `SendInitialMessages` method, called at the end)\r\n2. Adapt the current state of this PR to only start processing messages of outbound peers after `m_outbound_version_message_sent` is set (as you suggested above)\r\n3. Keep it as it is, as there are probably no relevant node implementations out there that are still non-shy (light clients generally don't accept inbound connections as far as I'm aware, so they wouldn't be affected by it)\r\n\r\nAny other options? 2. seems overly complex and 3. is more of a strong gut feeling (but can hardly be proven and it's kind of irresponsible, so I guess we really shouldn't do that), so I would tend to go for option 1.",

In this\ncase, the self-connect remains undiscovered, as the detection doesn't\nfind the outbound peer in `m_nodes` yet (see `CConnman::CheckIncomingNonce`).\n\nFix this by swapping the order of 2. and 3., by taking the `PushNodeVersion`\ncall out of `InitializeNode` and doing that in the `SendMessages` method\ninstead, which is only called for `CNode` instances in `m_nodes`.\n\nThanks go to vasild, mzumsande, dergoegge and sipa for suggestions on\nhow to fix this.",

I thought about reverting [c340503](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/c340503b67585b631909584f1acaa327f5af25d3) locally to find out, but didn't have the time yet.\r\n\r\nFYI, I tested reverting c340503b67585b631909584f1acaa327f5af25d3 on top of this branch now and without the latest fix (2) to ProcessMessages, other messages are actually sent before `version`, and `p2p_add_connection.py` fails intermittently - so the fix works.",
