    "body": "This PR fixes a recently discovered race condition in the self-connect detection (see #30362 and #30368).\r\n\r\nInitiating an outbound network connection currently involves the following steps after the socket connection is established (see [`CConnman::OpenNetworkConnection`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/bd5d1688b4311e21c0e0ff89a3ae02ef7d0543b8/src/net.cpp#L2923-L2930) method):\r\n1. set up node state\r\n2. queue VERSION message (both steps 1 and 2 happen in [`InitializeNode`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/bd5d1688b4311e21c0e0ff89a3ae02ef7d0543b8/src/net_processing.cpp#L1662-L1683))\r\n3. add new node to vector `m_nodes`\r\n    \r\nIf we connect to ourself, it can happen that the sent VERSION message (step 2) is received and processed locally *before* the node object is added to the connection manager's `m_nodes` vector (step 3). In this case, the self-connect remains undiscovered, as the detection doesn't find the outbound peer in `m_nodes` yet (see `CConnman::CheckIncomingNonce`).\r\n    \r\nFix this by swapping the order of 2. and 3., by taking the `PushNodeVersion` call out of `InitializeNode` and doing that in the `SendMessages` method instead, which is only called for `CNode` instances in `m_nodes`.\r\n\r\nThe temporarily reverted test introduced in #30362 is readded. Fixes #30368.\r\n\r\nThanks go to vasild, mzumsande and dergoegge for suggestions on how to fix this (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30368#issuecomment-2200625017 ff. and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30394#discussion_r1668290789).",

In this\ncase, the self-connect remains undiscovered, as the detection doesn't\nfind the outbound peer in `m_nodes` yet (see `CConnman::CheckIncomingNonce`).\n\nFix this by swapping the order of 2. and 3., by taking the `PushNodeVersion`\ncall out of `InitializeNode` and doing that in the `SendMessages` method\ninstead, which is only called for `CNode` instances in `m_nodes`.\n\nThanks go to vasild, mzumsande and dergoegge for suggestions on how to\nfix this.",

Otherwise, you can do a proper wait (as suggested) by moving the `wait_until` into the inner scope.",
