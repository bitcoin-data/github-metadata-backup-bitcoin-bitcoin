    "body": "Removes the deprecation for the `datacarrier` and `datacarriersize` options by reverting commit 0b4048c73385166144d0b3e76beb9a2ac4cc1eca from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406\r\n\r\n**Many current Bitcoin Core users want to continue using this option**\r\nThis statement is based on public postings from many Bitcoin Core users and not a formal survey. AJ Towns’ observation from [#32406](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406/commits/0b4048c73385166144d0b3e76beb9a2ac4cc1eca#r2084024874) that “_for now there seem to be a bunch of users who like the option_” has only become more apparent in the months since.\r\n\r\n**The deprecation intent is unclear to users**\r\nThis echo’s Ava Chow’s comment from #32714 that “_IMO we should not have removal warnings if there is no current plan to actually remove them._” In months since that comment, partially due to increased feedback from Bitcoin Core users wanting to keep this option, there is even less likelihood of a near term plan to remove these options. That leaves Bitcoin Core users in an unclear situation: the option could be removed in the next version or perhaps never. Removing the deprecation gives clarity for their planning purposes. Deprecating the option in the future, preferably with a removal schedule to better inform users, would still be possible.\r\n\r\n**Minimal downsides to removing deprecation**\r\nAs a best practice, Bitcoin Core has avoided an option when the developers cannot articulate when they should be used. There is non-zero maintenance cost to keeping this code around (although leaving the options deprecated for a long time has the same effect). “Don’t offer users footguns” is also a good principle, but with this option, there seems to be only small impacts that can quickly be remedied by changing the option value by Bitcoin Core users. There already exist in Bitcoin Core more potentially-user-harmful options/values than what datacarrier might cause.\r\n",

      "body": "ACK 451ba9ada41f687c0e4bb34d5925374a68a8f8a3\r\n\r\nI don't think getting upset about the presence or absence of a deprecation note is sensible, so my ACK shouldn't be taken as an indication that I'll be upset if this PR isn't merged.\r\n\r\nThere were a few rationales given for deprecation, I think the strongest being:\r\n\r\n * the philosophy that \"all user options should either come with clear recommendations for how to use them or, if no recommendation can be made, they should not exist or be discouraged\" ([ref](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#issuecomment-2955614286))\r\n * the expectation that the option will be removed in the next release or shortly thereafter ([ref](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#discussion_r2088901333))\r\n\r\nAs far as the first point goes, I think we can actually make clear recommendations for when to use the datacarrier options:\r\n\r\n * if you wish to avoid including large OP_RETURN outputs in blocks you mine, then reducing the datacarriersize will allow you to do that\r\n * if you wish to be more strongly compatible with the 29.x and earlier relay policy, reducing the datacarriersize to 83 will get you most of the way there\r\n * if the new default policy causes unforseen problems, then reducing the datacarriersize may allow you to avoid/mitigate those problems without needing to deploy a new release of the software\r\n\r\nI think the latter two recommendations generalise fairly well, and thus that it's probably a bad idea to both change a configuration option's default and remove/deprecate that option at the same time.\r\n\r\nAs far as the first point goes, I don't believe a deprecation notice without a definitive removal timeline specified should be taken as an expectation that the option will be removed soon ([ref](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#issuecomment-2861778194), [ref](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#discussion_r2090119662)), and I don't believe there's any significant value in removing this option, as the maintenance cost for keeping it is extremely low.\r\n\r\nI wrote previously that \"the reason to recommend not using it is because it will likely harm the efficiency of block reconstruction, slowing down block relay\", but I don't think the effect there is particularly significant: with compact blocks working efficiently we expect blocks to be relayed across the network in perhaps 500ms (200ms one-way latency to the other side of the world, plus a couple of 150ms sets as nodes actually validate the block), which gives an implied orphan rate of about 0.08% or about 1 in 1250 blocks, which is pretty close to what we see. When compact block relay requires a request, that forces 1.5 round trips (tripling the latency versus the one-way value) so that may give a value from 900ms to 1500ms, with an implied orphan rate between 0.15% and 0.25%. If you're currently mining with an orphan rate of 0.08% then an orphan rate of 0.25% would be a decrease in revenue of 0.17%. For comparison, the difficulty increase from early May to now (given the same hashrate) implies a decrease in revenue of 19.5%, more than 100x as much. I think it makes sense to set defaults to maximise even small amounts of revenue, but that's a \"picking up pennies\" saving, not a \"small miners will be put out of business\" situation.",

In these conditions, i do not see the project removing the option anytime soon.

Multiple OP_RETURN outputs are still allowed by this change, creating a situation where users cannot get the same behavior from their nodes' relay policy from previous versions through configuration.\r\n> \r\n> It's still a mystery to me why multiple OP_RETURNs are being allowed since an extra OP_RETURN costs at least 9 more vbytes and the same data can be stored in one OP_RETURN with some sort of (perhaps multi-byte) delimiter. Perhaps there are use-cases for multiple OP_RETURNs that can't be done in one OP_RETURN that I'm not aware of?\r\n\r\nyou can get the same behavior - use one op return. the data-carrier size with multiple op returns is the sum of the data across them. limiting number of op returns isn't protective, people who want to can create multiple transactions, which is higher overhead than one transaction with multiple op returns. obviously a single op return is lower overhead than multiple, but people can create multiple transactions too fi they want so it's not something logical to attempt to discourage with policy.",

It is not Core’s role, or Knots’, or anyone’s to decide which options P2P participants may use.\r\n\r\nRemoving configurability from the reference implementation raises the barrier for non-technical users who want to run Bitcoin with their preferred settings. This restricts freedom of choice without solving the underlying \"\"issue\"\", since such filtering cannot be enforced. Anyone can still run older Core versions and set parameters like `datacarriersize` manually, but doing so means giving up the performance improvements of newer releases.\r\n\r\nimo this is a step in the right direction.\r\n",

IMHO if we want to build software that we consider good for the users, as we stated in the  [relay-policy post](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2025/06/06/relay-statement/), we should stay in that position and keep taking decisions based on what we think is the best and not for \"drama\" consequences.\r\n\r\nThe campaign against Core is big and a change like this can be seen as a \"we are not that bad\" and a try to make them stop complaining.\r\n\r\nThis change is clearly not enough for the users whose ultimate goal is to get the default value and behavior back. This PR will not change anything in that way, but it can give the message, to people who supported the change (and supported Core devs), that it may not be worth to support us next time because public pressure and FUD can easily change our minds. And anyway, because of what I mentioned already, the people who are complaining don't use Core and won't start using it after this change.\r\n\r\nI would prefer a PR improving the deprecation message to make it clear that we are discouraging the use of the option, but not planning to remove it (for the moment). Re-opening https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32714 with the deprecation message back sounds like a better idea to me.\r\n\r\nIf we consider that \"filtering\" transactions is bad, we must discourage doing it.",

      "body": "> Is the argument that poor compact block reconstruction rates leads to miner centralization overblown then if the loss in revenue due to orphans is dwarfed by the increasing difficulty? I thought this argument was one of the reasons for both uncapping `OP_RETURN` limits and for allowing sub-1sat/vb relay?\r\n\r\nThe comparison is that losing $1.70 out of every $1000 in revenue is effectively just noise or a rounding error in an environment where you're getting $195 swings due to other factors, so is unlikely to be a make-or-break effect. But that said, $1.70 is still better than $0 (or losing $193.50 is better than losing $195), so it's still worth trying to improve things. Over a year, 0.17% of revenue for a miner with 1% of global hashrate is $300k at current prices, for instance.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of compact block relay saw a much larger decrease in block relay times -- on the order of perhaps 6 seconds down to 0.5 seconds, which corresponds to implied orphan rates of 1% (one a day) reducing to 0.08% (one a week), so the saving there is closer to $10 out of every $1000, which is more impactful. But that change wasn't just due to avoiding round trips, but also due to reduced bandwidth usage, relaying after checking proof of work but before full validation, and other improvements in validation performance. So I think it makes sense that inefficiencies here don't take us all the way back to the bad old days of 2016, and we don't need to worry that every non-optimal in this area choice might have large centralizing effects.\r\n\r\nThe \"degrades compact block performance\" argument applies to any relay policy differences where there is significant number of txs that make use of the distinction; so likely applies to all of fullrbf, OP_RETURN, sub-1sat relay, TRUC, ephemeral anchors, and ancestor/cluster limits. It's potentially particularly strong for sub-1sat relay, since that often involves enough transactions that it not only adds a round-trip, but the amount of data that needs to be relayed for blocks that are mostly sub1sat may also become impactful, particularly for the first few listening peers to see the block that need to relay the block data to over 100 peers each.",

My earlier question remains unaddressed:\r\n\r\n>>Why should Bitcoin Core support a config option to perform targeted censorship of large OP_RETURNs?\r\n\r\n@Sjors made a concise point on how deprecation/removal are tied together: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#issuecomment-2851233257\r\n\r\n>It briefly retains it, typically deprecation is followed by removal one release later. So if you're opposed to direct removal, then everyone will understand that you're also opposed to deprecation, so there's nothing new to say.",

I think the documentation could mention the previous default, and that it was changed to improve network efficiency and censorship resistance, but that there are practical and philosophical disagreements about how to deal with network abuse, and many node operators will choose to set a lower value and limit what they relay despite some costs. Would be good to keep code documentation short and link externally to an updated developer statement, or a markdown doc, or a wiki page that conveys the different views accurately and responsibly (e.g. focusing on technical and philosophical aspects and avoiding legal speculation.)\r\n\r\nI could imagine developers who think having technically unnecessary options is \"counterproductive\" may also think documenting those options is counterproductive, but IMO we will waste a lot more time trying to take away options some people want, than acknowledging genuine differences of opinion, accepting some small technical overhead, and trying to provide the best tools and information we can to people using software we release.\r\n\r\nI also understand that PRs improving the documentation will not satisfy people who want to revert to the previous default behavior or even remove the ability to configure it at all. But having the option at least gives people who favor restrictive relay policy a chance to positively advocate for their views, explain and demonstrate them, and convince other people of their benefits. To the extent both sides can step away from coercive measures and simply present the best case for their views, I think that is a good thing.",

      "body": "I keep flipping between acking or nacking this change. I actually considered proposing something similar a few weeks ago but ultimately decided against it, so I understand the motivations here.\r\n\r\nWhile we all want Bitcoin to succeed as the best form of money ever created, and we all understand that transactions need to generate sufficient fees to keep miners alive, I don't see how deliberately misconfiguring our nodes to reject transactions that will likely be mined anyway helps achieve these goals. Adding options to deliberately mispredict acceptance is not a feature I am enthusiastic about.\r\n\r\nWe need exceptionally strong technical justifications for deviating from consensus rules. Every time we add filters to prohibit something that would otherwise be valid on-chain (simply because some of us personally dislike it), we're narrowing the design space and potential use cases of Bitcoin. This is particularly concerning given that Bitcoin likely cannot survive long-term in its current state with consistently low mempool activity - we need transaction demand from wherever it comes. Things will settle over time, but \"optimizing\" for short-term consistency has too many unwanted consequences.\r\n\r\nThe role of relay policy should be descriptive, not prescriptive - we should aim to predict what *will* be mined, not try to influence what we think *should* be mined. In that context, adding logs, warnings, and deprecations to discourage people from using these options as makeshift censorship tools is actually part of our educational responsibility to users. We're helping them understand that these settings, when misused, make their nodes less effective at their primary job while not achieving what they claim to use them for.\r\n\r\nWe do have legitimate cases where we limit certain transaction patterns for clear technical reasons, like the recently added 2500 sigop limit that prevents certain ugly DoS attacks. But expanding subjective filtering beyond these narrow technical necessities puts us on a dangerous slippery slope toward a centralized network. We already have networks that don't contain garbage, but this is the only uncensorable network - let's focus on making honest users happy instead of wanting to punish participants we happen to disagree with.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I don't object to removing the deprecation warning in the next major release, so A​C​K for that aspect.\r\nHowever, I'm leaning towards a N​A​C​K for backporting this change to v30. The people who strongly oppose the v30 relay policy changes won't be satisfied by merely removing a deprecation warning - they want the default behavior reverted entirely. Meanwhile, those who support the v30 changes will view this backport as caving to social pressure, applying cosmetics to silence opposition. It's a lose-lose situation that satisfies no one while creating additional release management burden.",

Given how much collective effort this has required, I think we should be realistic about what this PR achieves.\r\n\r\nI believe this PR tries to align the documentation with what users can expect. Usage of these options can cause the node to reject transactions that are likely to be mined, so the docs should discourage their use (to me, that means deprecated). However, it seems that removal in the near future is (1) unlikely and (2) has a few technical objections like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33453#issuecomment-3318779164. I cannot predict the future, but I would guess it is more accurate to remove the sentence saying to expect their removal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not pave a path towards changing the default again, commit the project to maintaining any particular configuration, or *by itself* give users a clearer understanding of the node’s datacarrier policies and what to expect. We still have lots of communication to do.\r\n\r\nFwiw I don’t think it makes sense to target this for v31 and not v30. ~AFAIK there is already a PR for rc2 (see #33424, #32275) and I personally don't think it's worth holding up the release for this PR. So the merge + backport + release notes changes need to happen very quickly for this to be incorporated.~ (EDIT: this can go in rc3)",

      "body": "> This is the 3rd PR since #32406's merge discussing what the config options' docs should say.\r\n\r\nThank you to all who have reviewed and provided thoughtful feedback on this PR. \r\n\r\n> I believe this PR tries to align the documentation with what users can expect. Usage of these options can cause the node to reject transactions that are likely to be mined, so the docs should discourage their use (to me, that means deprecated). However, it seems that removal in the near future is (1) unlikely and (2) has a few technical objections like [#33453 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33453#issuecomment-3318779164). I cannot predict the future, but I would guess it is more accurate to remove the sentence saying to expect their removal.\r\n\r\nIIUC, there seems to be support for removing the \"expected to be removed in a future version\" sentence, and leaving the options as deprecated. The sentence removal addresses ambiguity around availability of the option in the near and medium term, and the deprecated status of the option indicates only discouragement of using the options. This reflects the reality of the situation IMHO. Tangibly, that would mean closing this PR and a new one to  change the sentence as outlined by @polespinasa in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33453/files#r2369422871 ? I am happy to do that, although someone else may be able to do it more expeditiously. Let me know @glozow. \r\n\r\nGiven the widespread interest in the option by Bitcoin Core users, Id suggest any future work around this option, including any plans around its removal, include a clear timeline. I believe thats already customary in the project, but wanted to reiterate.\r\n\r\n> This PR does not pave a path towards changing the default again, commit the project to maintaining any particular configuration, or _by itself_ give users a clearer understanding of the node’s datacarrier policies and what to expect. We still have lots of communication to do.\r\n\r\nAgreed on communication and that is downstream from any related changes here. Happy to help on this. I think the \"deprecated but not currently scheduled for removal\" will be a near term confusion for Bitcoin Core users, should the suggestion you made above be accepted. But again, mostly separate work from this repository.\r\n\r\n> Fwiw I don’t think it makes sense to target this for v31 and not v30. AFAIK there is already a PR for rc2 (see #33424, #32275) and I personally don't think it's worth holding up the release for this PR. So the merge + backport + release notes changes need to happen very quickly for this to be incorporated.\r\n\r\nI defer to you and the other maintainers on this. I think merging a PR with some version of the wording suggestion above to the codebase, regardless of whether it is released in v30 or v31 \"should\" have the desired clarification.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> > This is the 3rd PR since #32406's merge discussing what the config options' docs should say.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you to all who have reviewed and provided thoughtful feedback on this PR.\r\n> \r\n> > I believe this PR tries to align the documentation with what users can expect. Usage of these options can cause the node to reject transactions that are likely to be mined, so the docs should discourage their use (to me, that means deprecated). However, it seems that removal in the near future is (1) unlikely and (2) has a few technical objections like [#33453 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33453#issuecomment-3318779164). I cannot predict the future, but I would guess it is more accurate to remove the sentence saying to expect their removal.\r\n> \r\n> IIUC, there seems to be support for removing the \"expected to be removed in a future version\" sentence, and leaving the options as deprecated. The sentence removal addresses ambiguity around availability of the option in the near and medium term, and the deprecated status of the option indicates only discouragement of using the options. This reflects the reality of the situation IMHO. Tangibly, that would mean closing this PR and a new one to change the sentence as outlined by @polespinasa in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33453/files#r2369422871 ? I am happy to do that, although someone else may be able to do it more expeditiously. Let me know @glozow.\r\n> \r\n> Given the widespread interest in the option by Bitcoin Core users, Id suggest any future work around this option, including any plans around its removal, include a clear timeline. I believe thats already customary in the project, but wanted to reiterate.\r\n> \r\n> > This PR does not pave a path towards changing the default again, commit the project to maintaining any particular configuration, or _by itself_ give users a clearer understanding of the node’s datacarrier policies and what to expect. We still have lots of communication to do.\r\n> \r\n> Agreed on communication and that is downstream from any related changes here. Happy to help on this. I think the \"deprecated but not currently scheduled for removal\" will be a near term confusion for Bitcoin Core users, should the suggestion you made above be accepted. But again, mostly separate work from this repository.\r\n> \r\n> > Fwiw I don’t think it makes sense to target this for v31 and not v30. AFAIK there is already a PR for rc2 (see #33424, #32275) and I personally don't think it's worth holding up the release for this PR. So the merge + backport + release notes changes need to happen very quickly for this to be incorporated.\r\n> \r\n> I defer to you and the other maintainers on this. I think merging a PR with some version of the wording suggestion above to the codebase, regardless of whether it is released in v30 or v31 \"should\" have the desired clarification.\r\n\r\n\"deprecated but not currently scheduled for removal\" makes no sense to me from a user point of view..\r\nAlso, suggesting that the use is discouraged but without providing clear communication is wrong imo, considering also that, as @ajtowns suggested here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33453#issuecomment-3318779164 , with compact blocks the effects of setting datacarriersize or disabling datacarrier might not be particularly significant.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33453#issuecomment-3318779164\r\n\r\nWhy don't you simply merge the PR as it is, so we can have it in v30?\r\nWhen / if there will be a plan to actually deprecate those options with clear communication from the proponents, we could simply change the description again to match the plan.",

      "body": "> No because the high latency statistically hurts small miners disproportionately relative to large, and that effect is made worse by selfish mining attacks which benefit large miners.\r\n\r\nThe difference between large miners and small miners here is that large miners are (a) more likely to get two blocks in a row, meaning they have ~0 latency, and (b) may have more resources to spend setting up their own custom FIBRE relay network or similar, to improve latency for themselves. But the effect of doing such things is only to reduce the cost, ie instead of losing 0.17% they lose some smaller amount. The 0.17% figure reflects the maximum loss in this scenario, even if you're a small miner who can't do anything about it, and everyone else is a big miner that can make the problem go away entirely. (If nobody can make the problem go away, then the difficulty adjustment means no one suffers a loss)\r\n\r\n> it incentivizes other centralizing issue like private submission APIs and private peering among miners and pools.\r\n\r\nIn the blocks between 890,000 (March 30) and 915,843 (last week), there were 320 (non-coinbase) txs with multiple op_returns, 319 of which paid a total of 0.09390199 BTC in fees, with the remainder being [a payment to Mara from Gemini](https://mempool.space/tx/8245e67349565e481c622fe3437408db7344cdf730edb193c1466326eb021c0b) for a [block containing transaction artwork](https://mempool.space/block/0000000000000000000011a508e48be0bbe2cf4cd3ec062cfafc19f78ea810e0?audit=false). All but 22 of those transactions had a single input, so as far as cryptography is concerned, could have been a single output.\r\n\r\nIn the ~15k blocks between 900,000 (June 6) and 915,843, there were 131 op_return outputs larger than the 83-byte default, of which 75 were larger than 163-bytes, 31 were larger than 1000-bytes, 6 were larger than 10000-bytes, and none were larger than 21000 bytes.\r\n\r\nIn the 10k blocks between 890,000 and 899,999 (ie, from two weeks prior to the issue being raised on the mailing list to a couple of days prior to the new default being merged into master on June 9th), there were 13443 op_return outputs larger than the 83-byte default, of which 584 were large than 163-bytes, 65 were larger than 1000 bytes, 8 were larger than 10,000 bytes and 2 were larger than 100,000 bytes (and thus would be filtered due to tx size anyway; both essentially filled their blocks). That is, while this was being actively debated, large op_returns came through at a rate about 164 times higher than after the debate was settled.\r\n\r\nSo private submission/peering for op_return larger than around 163/1000 bytes, or multiple op_returns per tx doesn't seem like a pressing problem afaics.\r\n\r\nAgain, it doesn't seem beneficial to small miners to filter these transactions, but the difference in profitability from doing so seems pretty trivial. The ability for large miners to sell customized blocks like that pizza block may be more concerning -- it received the equivalent of a block full of ~160sat/vb txs when the average fee rate was 2 to 4 sat/vb, though out of band payments or kickbacks may increase or decrease that figure.",

This is also a mild negative for nodes, as large op returns are 4x more expensive than inscription hiding, and so there is limited incentive to use, and if it were little used, it would by implication have limited compact block latency impact.\r\n\r\nSo wouldn't \"discouraged for non mining use cases\" be a more logical warning, and without the \"deprecation\" message?",
