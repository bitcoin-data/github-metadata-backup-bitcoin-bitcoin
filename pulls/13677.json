    "body": "A user may configure `disablewallet=1` for instance to prevent a wallet from accidentally being created (which could lead to confusion as to what to backup).\r\n\r\nSince #13059 a user might also use that option to prevent someone with RPC access from dynamically loading a wallet there're not supposed to.\r\n\r\nThe most rigorous way to do the above is to compile with `--disable-wallet`.\r\n\r\nAs of #13112 unknown config arguments throw an error. So the user in the above scenario would have to remove this line. But then later if they download a new binary with wallet support compiled, they might forget to add it back. For that reason I believe `disablewallet=1` should always be allowed.\r\n\r\nAlthough unknown config arguments throw an error, the wallet interface added in #10762 includes a dummy wallet to handle `--disable-wallet`. Part of this dummy wallets adds `disablewallet` and other wallet parameters to the list of hidden params; those aren't shown in help, but their presence won't throw an error. This might change in the some future refactor though\r\n\r\nSo I added a comment that hopefully  prevents a future refactor from causing `disablewallet=1` to throw when compiled with `--disable-wallet`.",
