    "body": "This teaches Gitian to use the new depends system rather than the old build scripts. See #4592 for the reasoning.\n\nImportant: This relies on a new caching feature in Gitian. When building (for ex) the linux descriptor, the dependencies will be built and cached. On subsequent builds, if the dependencies have not changed, a cached version will be used rather than rebuilding. For that reason, the descriptors can be a clean one-per-OS. Gitian rev e9741525c or newer is required to take advantage of this.\n\nIn order to take advantage of the new cache, sources are no longer listed as inputs. Instead they are handled by the dependency builder. After they've been fetched once, they'll be cached and re-used.\n\nAll target libs are cross-built as necessary now, rather than using apt-get to install. That means that a single OS image (in this case Precise x64) can be used for everything.\n",

      "body": "Gitian doesn't manage the dependency cache, it blindly copies the result of the build. So if the build nukes the cache, it's gone (see huge caveat below, this is completely untrue in practice). Currently the dependency builder removes everything but the most recent result for each dependency, so that it can be used by set-and-forget systems without worry of disks filling up.\n\nHuge caveat: Gitian uses scp to xfer the build cache back to the bare-metal builder. If a file is deleted in the cache, when the dir is scp'd back to the bare-metal, all left-over files still remain there. This would be solved by using something like \"rsync --delete\" instead of scp, but I'm not sure that is the most reasonable behavior.\n\nSo the actual answer is: all built dependencies are saved until they're manually deleted. The cache can be safely purged at any time. So if you're bouncing back and forth between branches, both cached versions will be preserved.\n",

I'd generally much have preferred that gitian was used directly  on travis (dunno what they support, but some neutered LXC containerish thing should be possible, or maybe a null-op vm where there is no vm?) and continue using the gitian dependency management stuff instead of a wrapper around our own dependency management system in-tree. I'd generally avoid having people use depends/ in any case where they can avoid it (ie unless they're cross-compiling) and encourage people to use gitian anyway. Maybe I'm just not happy with depends/ being /depends and not /contrib/depends.\n",

Which would be nice but not sure it's worth the extra testing time.

      "body": "I've been testing the linux executables. Testcases run OK and cursory runs of the various executables work.\n\nHowever there are various problems reported by `symbol-check.py`\n- For example on `bitcoin-cli` (64-bit, 32-bit is the same):\n\n```\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoin-cli: symbol memcpy from unsupported version GLIBC_2.14\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoin-cli: symbol std::out_of_range::~out_of_range() from unsupported version GLIBCXX_3.4.15\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoin-cli: export of symbol typeinfo for boost::asio::detail::typeid_wrapper<boost::asio::ip::resolver_service<boost::asio::ip::tcp> > not allowed\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoin-cli: export of symbol std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > std::operator+<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >(char const*, std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&) not allowed\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoin-cli: export of symbol vtable for boost::exception not allowed\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoin-cli: export of symbol vtable for boost::exception_detail::error_info_injector<boost::bad_get> not allowed\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoin-cli: export of symbol typeinfo for boost::asio::detail::typeid_wrapper<boost::asio::deadline_timer_service<boost::posix_time::ptime, boost::asio::time_traits<boost::posix_time::ptime> > > not allowed\n... (more boost exports follow)\n```\n\nBitcoind:\n\n```\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoind: symbol std::__detail::_List_node_base::_M_hook(std::__detail::_List_node_base*) from unsupported version GLIBCXX_3.4.15\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoind: symbol memcpy from unsupported version GLIBC_2.14\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoind: symbol std::length_error::~length_error() from unsupported version GLIBCXX_3.4.15\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoind: symbol __fdelt_chk from unsupported version GLIBC_2.15\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoind: symbol std::out_of_range::~out_of_range() from unsupported version GLIBCXX_3.4.15\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoind: symbol std::__detail::_List_node_base::_M_unhook() from unsupported version GLIBCXX_3.4.15\nbuild/out/bin/64/bitcoind: export of symbol std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > std::operator+<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >(char const*, std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&) not allowed\n...\n```\n- From this you'd expect that the compatibility wrapper is not enabled, and symbol filtering is disabled? Not according to build.log, so I'm not sure where all the boost exports come from:\n\n```\nchecking for working boost reduced exports... yes\nchecking whether the linker accepts -Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL... yes\n```\n- `--enable-glibc-back-compat` is not logged, but there is no message about `__fdelt_chk` being logged. So that is probably disabled.\n- The static Qt has a few issues on my Ubuntu system, as expected: no longer it takes the theme from the system, and the 'tray icon' looks weird and doesn't use the OS's menu anymore.\n",

It's very flaky with newer compilers and requires lots of patching. If 4.6 turns out to be required I can go that route.\n\nI elected instead to go with 4.8 and hook up a back-compat option for qt, similar to what we have with glibc. For now, I'd like to avoid any bikeshedding on the option itself and how its implemented, and just focus on whether or not it actually works. I haven't tested yet on a distro with an old 4.6 or 4.8.\n\nIf it _does_ work, it would be a big advantage because it wouldn't require gitian builds to test release-version behavior, it would only need a configure switch.\n\nEdit: I meant we should avoid discussing the semantics of the configure switch itself. Arguing the code implementation is fair game.\n",

This should generate the same test failures that msvc produces in its debug builds. It also allows for other tools to be plugged in down the road, namely clang's fsanitize options. For anyone (including pull-tester and Travis) building without using the new debug option, the depends changes are a no-op.\n\nThis adds the concept of debug/release to the depends, which I’ve been meaning to do for quite a while. If debug is used (make DEBUG=1), the depends are compiled using their respective debug options and flags. These flags are passed down to Bitcoin as well.\n\nAdditionally extra libstdc++ options are enabled, which will cause runtime failures for various stl bugs which would otherwise continue with undefined behavior. For these options, building Bitcoin with them is not enough, they require that dependencies are built the same way.\n\nDevs may also wish to use these debug depends when tracking down bugs deep within dependencies.\n\nThis PR also fixes 2 of those stl issues. The rest have either already been fixed, or will be fixed by the PR’s listed above. At that point, the debug build should succeed and can be enabled for travis so that it may catch future issues.\n",

It is used to generate certain symbol names\n that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used\n to place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files\n that produce them. You can use the -frandom-seed option to produce\n reproducibly identical object files.\n\n The string should be different for every file you compile.\n```\n\nFor gitian builds, we are breaking the \"should be different for every file you compile\" rule, which doesn't seem to be causing an issues right now but which I could imagine causing impossible-to-debug problems in the future.\n\nA little googling turned up this discussion thread about what to do about it:\nhttp://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-toolchain/2010-November/000023.html\n",

Many packagers (for example at various linux distros) include them as source in their packages, and it is desireable for an end user to be able to verify that the source code used to build a package is unmodified.\nThe only current way to achieve this includes cloning and verifying the git repo and diff it against the sources that the packager used, but it's alot of overhead imo.\n",
