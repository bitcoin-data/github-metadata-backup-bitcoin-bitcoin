A burden could be any of the following:\r\n\r\n* Time spent on review\r\n* Accidental introduction of bugs\r\n* (Silent) merge conflicts, either in the branch or a backport branch. Those conflicts demand further developer and reviewer time or introduce bugs.\r\n\r\nFor more information about refactoring changes and stylistic cleanup, see\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#refactoring\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15465\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26621#issuecomment-1401077847\r\n\r\nGenerally, if the style is not mentioned nor enforced by the developer notes, we leave it up to the original author to pick whatever fits them best personally and then leave it that way until the line is touched for other reasons.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any questions.",
