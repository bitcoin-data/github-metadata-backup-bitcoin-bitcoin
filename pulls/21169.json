      "body": "@adamjonas\r\n\r\nGood question and thanks for asking it explicitly! :)\r\n\r\nI should probably have stated that more clearly in the PR description, but it should be noted that this fuzzing harness is by far is the \"most covering\" harness in the repo.\r\n\r\nIncluding this harness in the existing set of fuzzing harnesses adds coverage to five(!) percent of the code base that is currently uncovered by fuzz testing. The total fuzzing coverage increases from 65% to 70%.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities to achieve such extreme coverage jumps from adding a single harness are _extremely_ rare at the relatively high levels of fuzzing coverage we've reached. TBH it would feel a bit disappointing if we had to pass on the excellent coverage opportunity that RPC fuzzing brings :)\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke, if we can find a way to reduce/mitigate the potential maintenance work you predict in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21169#issuecomment-783166677 would you be willing to reconsider your position? :)",
