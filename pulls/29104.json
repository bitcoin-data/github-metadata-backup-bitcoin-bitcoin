See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

One of\nthese changes was to stop stripping the .reloc section from binaries,\nwhich is required for working ASLR.\n\n.reloc section stripping is something we've accounted for previously,\nsee #18702. The related upstream discussion is in this thread:\nhttps://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19011.\n\nWhen we switched to using a newer Guix time-machine in #23778, we begun\nusing binutils 2.37 to produce releases. Since then, our windows\ninstaller (produced with makensis) has not functioned correctly when run on\na Windows system with the \"Force randomization for images (Mandatory ASLR)\"\noption enabled.

One of\nthese changes was to stop stripping the .reloc section from binaries,\nwhich is required for working ASLR.\n\n.reloc section stripping is something we've accounted for previously,\nsee #18702. The related upstream discussion is in this thread:\nhttps://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19011.\n\nWhen we switched to using a newer Guix time-machine in #23778, we begun\nusing binutils 2.37 to produce releases. Since then, our windows\ninstaller (produced with makensis) has not functioned correctly when run on\na Windows system with the \"Force randomization for images (Mandatory ASLR)\"\noption enabled. Note that all of our other release binaries, which all\ncontain .reloc sections, function fine under the same option, so it\ncannot be just the presence of a .reloc section that is the issue.\n\nFor now, restore makensis to it's pre-binutils-2.36 behaviour, which\nfixes the produced installer.

I thought I'd already backported this; noticed while building [sigs for 23.1rc1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs/pull/380), which I started doing on aarch64.\n\n  Guix Build (aarch64, no `x86_64-apple-darwin` or `arm64-apple-darwin`):\n  ```bash\n  9fd4601412738e9135e2732cfc8af911c54af8a1349c2af568b4748dd1907c3d  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/aarch64-linux-gnu/SHA256SUMS.part\n  36df2797cd7845ccb4f416b52f9dbd4cc7dd0242782c3143206d0c15239e8b02  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/aarch64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\n  6aa022173b23827ec2690823178b9d2d06108e159a9074e1a54a7d1a74b6c5db  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/aarch64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\n  1e98b6b5e2b58387106eb8f46367c4a42d03d6a881307ed115e7b6bfa1b2785a  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/arm-linux-gnueabihf/SHA256SUMS.part\n  b9ecbfbec1ee941acb7f19fb2ba02bfa24ef5feb0e072a9a8c39263f2cdfb172  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/arm-linux-gnueabihf/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\n  2834aa08f19c03e88e22009e3f860b470fe5942c42ae08041b8e79e28673154b  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/arm-linux-gnueabihf/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\n  9c787047070b1fe8c2beead22093dc73481e7c921993d95fb0e4ce8739f8e515  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/dist-archive/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114.tar.gz\n  1a82b19a5d07bccdead69b5d9fe9559e01a263b458ea48ff0a701ee9adf55a3c  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/powerpc64-linux-gnu/SHA256SUMS.part\n  3482de0ff01839aa98ca61b3c8a18de4773dd70e2b306f094b210a6c83839289  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/powerpc64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-powerpc64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\n  5bb8b7ab8740d6c4a49e8fe700f0305bcc7318eaffc0e3c967492f218774f371  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/powerpc64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-powerpc64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\n  5442e495049b386b8ec5bc50c06feb401fb263e25f0807aa58e7e8c091c42be7  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/powerpc64le-linux-gnu/SHA256SUMS.part\n  d685b1449379a3a1be139f243917d9987169cbc9901c7658a12044d27ce2762d  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/powerpc64le-linux-gnu/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-powerpc64le-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\n  14edbaf4c93346460ecff72ca22285c433c7dea5f9ccaccb4b49730f95d2d264  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/powerpc64le-linux-gnu/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-powerpc64le-linux-gnu.tar.gz\n  dec22e0f59513c3697de3c6906deb355010af36836285ab306de1ea8e4b88ff3  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/riscv64-linux-gnu/SHA256SUMS.part\n  d70b6b6d1a2950292e820898af8a79d850b415829bbb94db97b742f3ab7cc7d3  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/riscv64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-riscv64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\n  b5fd33257a81efacc61946b544e5af1582c9729fa57641ff3625d34f0e785cfd  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/riscv64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-riscv64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\n  30b6668d9e84503d2e2113a87051d3c5baeae8ad6b3fa3df7509d447c8d5f341  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/x86_64-linux-gnu/SHA256SUMS.part\n  33a6c5072328281872678fc0d709629f934fac05bdfb2e41cccf2ddd5724925b  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/x86_64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\n  c1c2ec074a88c6f0202ab067bd126c217573d028b3b1eb538db100eb0e316b53  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/x86_64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\n  2689a7cce5d1fc6decbb5dfd1361db21adc1c485ee4c644cdebf403b1d533be6  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/x86_64-w64-mingw32/SHA256SUMS.part\n  9d6259432febdc1be728db0088a0464fa844dc4ad20e7b752be6de312588a695  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-win64-debug.zip\n  e3e7cd45b6ed6e8a589efe2436e151120af0c1146772ce295c06300289e0b758  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\n  1da1569b0140ad917b938ce8b087d3d8990331df3042d62a36d1366d9e5f0f42  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-win64-unsigned.tar.gz\n  cbd74726e5704f6007e2344422197a25b9872a3a5f525a1a0b5774c833fc7e78  guix-build-0f4583e5c114/output/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bitcoin-0f4583e5c114-win64.zip\n  ```\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  hebasto:\n    ACK 0f4583e5c114e13c3c937f1832ab0c39751cf38c, tested on `arm64`:\n  jarolrod:\n    ACK 0f4583e5c114e13c3c937f1832ab0c39751cf38c\n\nTree-SHA512: 2ddb1ebaa75c26cc0bd8abd81e565a7ffa99bd9af08ad329f1141c35c784fb7cb4ccf0777096410929cb3e0bc72acaf3dbe0684bbe57b6d6a7070bff1fa51a0e",
