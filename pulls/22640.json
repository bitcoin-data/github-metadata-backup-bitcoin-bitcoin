    "body": "Resurrection of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16718\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**tl;dr**\r\n\r\nI try swapping out `std::unordered_map` for a faster third-party implementation where it matters, see something like 15% speedup for initial block download coincident with a 19.3% reduction in memory usage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen profiling initial block download, it's evident that a decent chunk of time on the critical path is spent in `CCoinsViewCache`, the data structure responsible for the in-memory representation of the UTXO set.\r\n\r\n![Selection_147](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/63644597-9b1b8700-c6ba-11e9-964c-91c6fb78b3a2.png)\r\n*Profile of the `msghand` thread at height ~300,000.*\r\n\r\nThe essential data member of the cache, `cacheCoins`, is a `std::unordered_map` that holds as many UTXO as can fit into memory given the `dbcache` setting. While this map implementation is definitely preferable to `std::map` (which retains order and has O(log(n)) lookups insted of O(1)), both stdlib maps are subpar [relative to non-`std` alternatives](https://martin.ankerl.com/2019/04/01/hashmap-benchmarks-01-overview/).\r\n\r\nAfter seeing cacheCoins as a bottleneck, I decided to try swapping one of these alternative implementations in to see if there is any benefit. It looks like there is.\r\n\r\n![ibd local range 500000 520000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/63644703-0a927600-c6bd-11e9-9e1d-2748b8fbdf8d.png)\r\n\r\nFor 20,000 blocks at a representative part of the chain, we see something like a 15% speedup with a 19.3% reduction in memory usage (dbcache was set to 3000).\r\n\r\nThe `CCoinsCaching` benchmark shows improvement but not as dramatically as IBD does:\r\n\r\n![microbenches](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/63644768-572a8100-c6be-11e9-922c-8360a9f9e3b4.png)\r\n\r\nObviously adding 2000 lines of new consensus-critical code isn't appealing, but if those numbers hold for the full IBD process I think there might be a compelling case to be made for the added code.\r\n\r\n### Implementations considered\r\n\r\nOf the few best-looking options, I picked the one with the most succinct implementation and fewest dependencies, [`robin_hood::unordered_node_map`](https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing) (it's just a header file). I also looked at Facebook's [`F14NodeMap`](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/container/F14.md) and Abseil's [`node_hash_map`](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/guides/container) but both required too much elbow-grease (for now) to integrate here without pulling in a whole lot of code.\r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\n\r\nI'm going to be running more comprehensive benchmarks, including a near-full IBD from the network, to see if these improvements hold.\r\n\r\nI'm also interested in benching this along with a similar change to `mapBlockIndex` (currently a `std::unordered_map`).\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\nIf we decide to include this or another hashmap implementation, should we do a full fork inclusion a la leveldb or should we try to slim down the implementation to a single header file as is done here (but more)?\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "I'm reopening this because I think it's worth some long-term consideration. We're not going to get many opportunities to improve block connection by ~12%, so I think this is worth continuing to look at. Now that bitcoin is on c++17, I wonder if there aren't some good ways to slim down @martinus's implementation, since it contains a number of provisions to deal with <c++17 platforms. At the very least we could work on fuzz testing this to our satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI've rerun some benchmarks on an idle workstation and have confirmed that I continue to see ~13% speedups along with reduction in memory use, which is especially pronounced when using a large dbcache.\r\n\r\n## Issues to consider\r\n\r\n- From the README: \"For a really bad hash the performance will not only degrade like in std::unordered_map, the map will simply fail with an std::overflow_error. In practice, when using the standard robin_hood::hash, I have never seen this happening.\"\r\n  - https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing/issues/117\r\n  - Possible that we can amend this behavior, or at least convince ourselves this is appropriately unlikely given our use of siphash?\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\n### dbcache=10000\r\n\r\n![ibd local range 500000 540000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/128412521-5c1951e2-85cf-44ec-9d01-bab8cad849b3.png)\r\n\r\n#### commands index\r\n|          bench name           |                                                                                                     command                                                                                                      |\r\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.540000 | `bitcoind -dbcache=10000 -debug=coindb -debug=bench -listen=0 -connect=0 -addnode=127.0.0.1:8888 -prune=9999999 -printtoconsole=0 -assumevalid=000000000000000000176c192f42ad13ab159fdb20198b87e7ba3c001e47b876` |\r\n\r\n\r\n#### jamesob/2019-08-robinhood vs. $mergebase (absolute)\r\n|                  bench name                   |  x  | jamesob/2019-08-robinhood  |         $mergebase         |\r\n|-----------------------------------------------|----:|----------------------------|----------------------------|\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.540000.total_secs      |   3 | 2812.5091 (± 27.2604)      | 3190.3358 (± 17.5632)      |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.540000.peak_rss_KiB    |   3 | 5517118.6667 (± 1750.8682) | 6344530.6667 (± 3478.0996) |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.540000.cpu_kernel_secs |   3 | 260.3867 (± 2.5737)        | 263.0400 (± 2.1568)        |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.540000.cpu_user_secs   |   3 | 12714.3000 (± 7.6987)      | 13223.2667 (± 8.7341)      |\r\n\r\n\r\n#### jamesob/2019-08-robinhood vs. $mergebase (relative)\r\n|                  bench name                   |  x  | jamesob/2019-08-robinhood | $mergebase |\r\n|-----------------------------------------------|----:|--------------------------:|-----------:|\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.540000.total_secs      |   3 |                         1 |      1.134 |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.540000.peak_rss_KiB    |   3 |                         1 |      1.150 |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.540000.cpu_kernel_secs |   3 |                         1 |      1.010 |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.540000.cpu_user_secs   |   3 |                         1 |      1.040 |\r\n\r\n\r\n### dbcache=300\r\n\r\n![ibd local range 500000 535000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73197/128412672-e4958f30-8cc4-410b-bdfd-9d98ff024c69.png)\r\n\r\n#### commands index\r\n|          bench name           |                                                                                                    command                                                                                                     |\r\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.535000 | `bitcoind -dbcache=300 -debug=coindb -debug=bench -listen=0 -connect=0 -addnode=127.0.0.1:8888 -prune=9999999 -printtoconsole=0 -assumevalid=000000000000000000176c192f42ad13ab159fdb20198b87e7ba3c001e47b876` |\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 2019-08-robinhood vs. master (absolute)\r\n|                  bench name                   |  x  |      2019-08-robinhood       |           master            |\r\n|-----------------------------------------------|----:|------------------------------|-----------------------------|\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.535000.total_secs      |   3 | 3592.5329 (± 202.2415)       | 4070.7353 (± 13.1181)       |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.535000.peak_rss_KiB    |   3 | 2049018.6667 (± 147027.9395) | 2110129.3333 (± 36744.0276) |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.535000.cpu_kernel_secs |   3 | 576.7433 (± 4.9359)          | 576.6567 (± 1.4616)         |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.535000.cpu_user_secs   |   3 | 10879.8767 (± 20.1319)       | 11260.5933 (± 8.3835)       |\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 2019-08-robinhood vs. master (relative)\r\n|                  bench name                   |  x  | 2019-08-robinhood | master |\r\n|-----------------------------------------------|----:|------------------:|-------:|\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.535000.total_secs      |   3 |              1.00 |  1.133 |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.535000.peak_rss_KiB    |   3 |              1.00 |  1.030 |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.535000.cpu_kernel_secs |   3 |              1.00 |  1.000 |\r\n| ibd.local.range.500000.535000.cpu_user_secs   |   3 |              1.00 |  1.035 |",

      "body": "It's unfortunately really hard to fix https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing/issues/117 without losing at least some of the performance benefit. Also I don't really have the time to do it properly... So I'm personally quite a bit weary about using my `robin_hood` map for such a critical place. I mean I've been using it in for a long time in many countless installations and personally have never seen that problem, but other users of the map have definitely seen it. And it definitely is possible for an malicious actor to construct sequence of values that will cause the map to always fail. That's not possible for unordered_map, this would only degrades the performance.\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to try the same benchmarks also with #16801 and also with `tsl::sparse_map`.\r\n\r\n* #16801 introduces a relatively simple bulk pool allocator for `std::unordered_map`. I think most of the performance improvement from robin_hood comes due to the more efficient allocation, and that pool allocator would bring the same allocation behavior to `std::unordered_map`. The code can be updated with C++17 features which would make it less of a hack. Such a pool allocator could also be beneficial in other places in the code too, wherever node based containers are used.\r\n\r\n* Have a look at memory efficient hashmap implementation: `tsl::sparse_map` seems to be excellent, header only, and in my benchmarks while slower than `robin_hood` it is faster than `std::unordered_map` and more memory efficient than both. I think being able to keep more elements in memory should be a better trade off because it needs less flushes. https://github.com/Tessil/sparse-map",

I didn't expect `tsl::sparse_map` and `phmap::node_hash_map` to be so slow. Maybe they fare better in a real world benchmark with lots of lookups.\r\n\r\nSo I think it would be worthwhile to properly benchmark the bulk_pool way and a faster hash. Not sure if such a strong hash like siphash is actually needed here.",

          "title": "faster & less memory for sync: bulk pool allocator for node based containers",
          "body": "This is a custom allocator for node based containers, as described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16718#issuecomment-525878177. Hopefully, this is a less controversial change and easier to review than https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16718.\r\n\r\nThe allocator retains memory of nodes, and allocates them in bulk. In my benchmarks, using this pool allocator for `CCoinsMap` gives about 16% faster `-reindex-chainstate`, and decreases memory usage by ~8%. The allocator is potentially useful for all node-based containers like `std::list`, `std::map`, `std::unordered_map`, etc. I believe this is especially useful on systems where malloc() and free() are relatively expensive operations, since this allocator will dramatically reduce these calls.\r\n\r\nSome noteworthy properties about this allocator:\r\n\r\n* It relies on the fact that node based containers allocate nodes one at a time. If a container doesn't behave like this, the allocator will still work but won't be any faster.\r\n\r\n* The allocator determines the size of the nodes, which will then be used throughout the pool, by the first call to allocate(1). So if the container would not allocate something with the size of a node in its first call to allocate(1), the pool won't be usable for nodes since it was set up with a different size. With C++17 it would be possible to use a containers type `node_type` to correctly initialize the pool's size, but for now we have to rely on this heuristic.\r\n\r\n* Copying / moving / swapping a map propagates the allocator. So if two different pools are used for two containers a and b, calling `a = b` will from now on use b's pool in a.\r\n\r\n* The pool is not threadsafe. Two containers which use the same pool in different threads won't work.\r\n\r\n* A pool's memory is only actually destroyed in the pool's destructor.\r\n\r\nI've added a benchmark to compare std::map, std::unordered_map with and without the pool allocator for the `CCoinsMap`.
