Use\nbrew to find out its prefix.\n\nAlso, qt5 added the host_bins variable to pkg-config, use it.\n\n@gavinandresen In order to deploy 0.9.3 successfully, I also needed to backport 502972f16bae79cf025bf9b63ec8276bc4a236bb and d16f6f87e1c15bd686e0e74ddb671da95a916c6d, though this was a quick local build and not gitian. It probably makes sense to just leave them alone if deploy/sign currently work for you, just thought I'd mention.\n",
