    "body": "**Problem:**\r\nFor stalling at the tip, we have a parallel download mechanism for compact blocks that was added in #27626.\r\nFor stalling during IBD, we have a lookahead window of 1024 blocks, and if that is exceeded, we disconnect the stalling peer.\r\nHowever, if we are close to but not at the tip (<=1024 blocks), neither of these mechanisms apply. We can't do compact blocks yet, and the stalling mechanism doesn't work because the 1024 window cannot be exceeded.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we have to resort to `BLOCK_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_BASE` which only disconnects a peer after 10 minutes (plus 5 minutes more for each additional peers we currently have blocks in flight). This is too long in my opinion, especially since peers get assigned up to 16 blocks (`MAX_BLOCKS_IN_TRANSIT_PER_PEER`) and could repeat this process to stall us even longer if they send us a block after 10 minutes.\r\nThis issue was observed in #29281 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12291#issuecomment-1898517930 with broken peers that didn't send us blocks.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution:**\r\nIf we are 1024 or less blocks away from the tip and haven't requested or received a block from any peer for 30 seconds, add another peer to download the critical block from that would help us advance our tip. Add up to two additional peers this way.\r\n\r\n**Other thoughts**\r\n* I also considered the alternative of extending the existing stalling mechanism that disconnects instead of introducing parallel downloads. This could be potentially less wasteful, but we might be over-eager to disconnect peers when really close to the tip, plus this might lead to cycling through lots of peers in extreme situations where we have a very slow internet connection.\r\n* The chosen timeout of 30 seconds could lead to inefficiencies / bandwidth waste when we have a really slow internet connection. Maybe it could make sense to track the last successful download times from existing peers and use a dynamic timeout according to that statistics, instead of setting it to a fixed value. \r\n* I will leave this PR in draft until I have tested it a bit more in the wild.\r\n\r\nFixes #29281",

Once parallel compact blocks is warmed up, the slots will likely be taken by those efforts.\r\n\r\nYes, I agree that it should also happen at the tip, both in the cases of low-bandwidth compact relay and in the case of no compact block relay - which seems like a good thing in most cases?! However, one possible downside might be that if you run with an extremely slow connection for which blocks typically take longer than 30s to download, it could be wasteful to add more peers.\r\n\r\n> If so, I wonder if this could allow us to f.e., not require a parallel compact slot be taken by an outbound, if we know we will try an outbound connection 30s later to defeat stalling behavior?\r\n\r\nI'd suspect we probably wouldn't want that, given that the additional peers introduced here are also likely to be inbound peers (if full), so attacker controlling many of our inbound slots could stall us effectively.\r\n\r\n> Having tests for the interplay would be interesting too.\r\n\r\nI will work on adding tests for this situation. I might also push some non-merge commits over the next days to hopefully find out why the test currently fails intermittently (still can't reproduce locally).\r\n",

If so, I'm thinking about that option (and how to exactly design an algorithm using it), and I think it could be applied to all kinds of stalling, also when deep in IBD - but it also has some downsides (more complexity, more data to keep track of, have to be careful it's not easily gameable). So I'm thinking about it but not completely sure if that is the best way to go.\r\n\r\nIn any case the current approach is more in line with the current IBD stalling detection (fixed timeouts).",

In which location do you think that it fits better (or even both?)?\r\n\r\nYour first commit looks great, will definitely take that (but haven't yet with the latest push).\r\n\r\nOne more thing: I added the condition `m_last_block_requested.load() > 0s` so that the near-tip stalling logic can't hit right after startup when we never requested a block from anyone.",
