    "body": "The docs at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs/blob/master/gitian-building/gitian-building-setup-gitian-debian.md instruct to create a `sudoers.d` entry and an `rc.local` script.  This PR brings `gitian-build.py` in line with those instructions.  Without this PR, running `gitian-build.py` from a stock Debian Buster VM fails due to the missing `br0`, and also prompts for sudo permissions frequently due to the missing `sudoers.d` entry.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR (and the existing instructions on which it is based) are suboptimal, as they will clobber an existing `rc.local` if one exists.  I'm open to suggestions on improving this (maybe putting it in `/etc/init.d/` instead?), though I think that if an improvement is made, it should be applied both to the English instructions and the automated script in order to keep them consistent.",

Even if the script is modified to support other distros, I don't think it should be made less useful for Debian/Ubuntu (i.e. I'd have no objection to only doing Debian/Ubuntu-specific stuff on those distros, but I think automating as much as possible on Debian/Ubuntu is a feature, not a bug).",
