    "body": "create a script for parsing the output from `bitcoind --help` to create an example conf file for new users\r\n\r\n## problem\r\n\r\nper #10746 , `bitcoin.conf` not being put into the data directory during installation causes some confusion for users when running bitcoin. in the discussion on the issue, one proposed solution was to have an example config file and instruct users to `cp` it into their data directory after startup. in addition to #10746 , there have been other requests for a \"skeleton config file\" (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19641) to help users get started with configuring bitcoind.\r\n\r\nthe main issue with an example config file is that it creates a second source of truth regarding what options are available for configuring bitcoind. this means any changes to the options (including the addition or removal of options) would have to be updated for the command line and also updated in the example file.\r\n\r\nthis PR addresses this issue by providing a script to generate an example file directly from the `bitcoind --help` on-demand by running `contrib/devtools/gen-bitcoin-conf.sh`. this solution was originally proposed on #10746 and would also solve #19641 . this guarantees any changes made to the command-line options or the command-line options help would also be reflected in the example file after compiling and running the script.\r\n\r\nthe main purpose of this script is to generate a config file to be included with releases, same as `gen-manpages.sh`. this ensures every release also includes an up-to-date, full example config file for users to edit. the script is also available for users who compile from source for generating an example config for their compiled binary.\r\n\r\n## special considerations\r\n\r\nthis removes the `bitcoin.conf` example file from the repo as it is now generated by this script. the original example file did contain extra text related to how to use certain options but going forward all option help docs should be moved into `init.cpp`\r\n\r\nthis also edits `init.cpp` to have the option help indicate that `-conf` is not usable from the config file. this is similar to how `-includeconf` 's help indicates it cannot be used from the command line\r\n",

      "body": "tACK 9fab9de36db3b6aae3b2b51fa14357c2fdc90f0d\r\nTested successfully on Ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\nThe PR is adding a script-based functionality to generate an example bitcoin.conf file instead of having a premade example bitcoin.conf file. This is done using a script `generate-example-bitcoin-conf.sh`, which uses some predefined text and the output of `./src/bitcoind --help` to create an example `bitcoin.conf` file.\r\n\r\n**Test failed** while using both `make install` and `./contrib/generate-example-bitcoin-conf.sh` command from root directory. **Worked** only after giving `sudo` permission to these commands.\r\nSo tested successfully using `sudo make install` and `sudo  ./contrib/generate-example-bitcoin-conf.sh`. This happened because the `./share/examples` folder was **protected** by default and could not be modified until given `sudo` access.\r\n\r\nI agree with the changes made by this PR because now the example `bitcoin.conf` file is very highly detailed and arranged so that understanding and changing something on the file has become very easy compared to the master’s example `bitcoin.conf` file.\r\nAlso in the current master the example `bitcoin.conf` file is fixed so we have to keep updating it, with each change that might effect working of `bitcoin.conf` file. With this PR the op is able to mitigate the example `bitcoin.conf` maintenance cost, by basically generating the file from `./src/bitcoind --help` command. Which makes sure `./src/bitcoind --help` and example `bitcoin.conf` file are always in sync. \r\n\r\nThough I agree with the concept I would highly recommend adding the following changes to the PR:\r\n\r\n1. In `doc/bitcoin-conf.md` file it should be mentioned that if both ways of creating the `bitcoin.conf` example file (`make file `and  `./contrib/generate-example-bitcoin-conf.sh`) fails then the issue could be that they require `sudo` permission to edit the `./share/examples` folder.\r\n\r\n2. The PR describes the problem that it is trying to solve as:\r\n\r\n    >per #10746 , `bitcoin.conf` not being put into the data directory during installation causes some confusion for users when running bitcoin. more details in the issue\r\n\r\n    But in reality, the PR is not doing anything to make it easier to put example `bitcoin.conf` file in the data directory. The aim of the PR, as far as I can see, is to improve example `bitcoin.conf` file’s flexibility wrt future changes in `./src/bitcoind --help`, and to make it easy to use.\r\nSo the PR description should be modified to display its motivations more accurately. \r\n<p>",

So the PR description should be modified to display its motivations more accurately.\r\n\r\ngood call out, i have updated the PR description to more accurately describe the problem this PR is addressing\r\n\r\nregarding your recommendation that the docs be updated to suggest running `sudo make install`, in general i am against recommending in docs that users run commands with sudo. id rather leave it to them to evaluate the error message and determine for themselves if running with sudo is necessary. i was also not able to reproduce the issue you are describing.\r\n\r\nwhile trying to recreate your issue, i did note that the script will fail if `--prefix` is used with `./configure` and have updated the script to use `src/bitcoind` when generating the file. this change is reflected in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22235/commits/9df03cb5c5abd8f31a4e93b006d5d3dd09e52a1d",

Addditionally, it's nice that the generated example file will only contain relevant options. For example, if i configure without wallet functionality, then the generated `bitcoin.conf` will not include these options.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of sections in the output file looks good, thanks for picking up that suggestion!",

I checked the created example **bitcoin.conf** permission, and I can see that it is `-rw-r--r--` \r\nI am adding the error I am getting while using the `make install` command without sudo:\r\n\r\n```\r\n /usr/bin/mkdir -p '/usr/local/lib'\r\n /bin/bash ../libtool --preserve-dup-deps  --mode=install /usr/bin/install -c   libbitcoinconsensus.la '/usr/local/lib'\r\nlibtool: install: /usr/bin/install -c .libs/libbitcoinconsensus.so.0.0.0 /usr/local/lib/libbitcoinconsensus.so.0.0.0\r\n/usr/bin/install: cannot remove '/usr/local/lib/libbitcoinconsensus.so.0.0.0': Permission denied\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough the error seems unrelated to this PR, I am can still not understand why sudo `make install` is creating the example bitcoin file with  `-rw-r--r--` permission.\r\n<p>",

Use a new setting in settings.json file, notifypolicy which is 0 by default (restricted) and can be set to 1 (unrestricted)\r\n\r\nI am not sure if people will agree to make these changes so workaround is to just document the security recommendation.

Portability issues like this are one of the reasons why we usually prefer python instead of bash scripts (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18132 as an example).\r\nOn the other hand re-implementing short sed/awk-scripts in python could be quite a burden and lead to bloated code, so I think it's fine as it is.\r\nIf this specific issue can't be resolved, maybe check the `uname -s` output and abort if it is not `Linux`? I'd prefer restricting to certain OSes (in case of Linux, a very popular one) rather than generating a bitcoin.conf that doesn't work.",

Open Source [Bitcoin Core Config generator](https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/) maintained by Jameson Lopp has better UI/UX to solve this problem which can be helpful for users looking to create config files with some templates, with each option categorized and explained in a better way.\r\n\r\n3. I don't think [contrib/devtools](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/devtools) is the right place to add such scripts if this is an attempt to help users.\r\n\r\n4. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13761 could be a better approach for _bitcoind_ users IMO with few changes based on review comments.",

Didn't look deeper into the sed/awk-magic extracting and transforming the relevant information.\r\n\r\n> personally, im not a fan of that information living in the comments of the config file. in the pr description, i mention that all help text should be moved to `init.cpp`; this ensures it will be in the generated config file and also the man pages.\r\n\r\nAgree that the config file is not the ideal place for extended information and primers. By the way, the PR description part you mentioned (that I overlooked before) also says that `init.cpp` is changed, but it isn't currently. Was this forgotten to commit or is it not relevant anymore? In the latter case, it would probably make sense to update the PR description accordingly.\r\n\r\n> for stuff that doesn't make sense to put in `init.cpp` but that we do want to keep, i think it should go in `docs/bitcoin-conf.md`. im working on a follow-up pr to this one to add some more info to `docs/bitcoin-conf.md` and was planning to see if it made sense to move the addnode and rpcauth sections over.\r\n\r\nSounds like a plan, feel free to ping me up on the follow-up PR.\r\n",

          "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nYes. One common problem with software setups is the pathing is corrupted. Proper pathing is one of the most important parts of getting started with any new software because if the path is depreciated the software will not properly run. This is the problem I am currently working on with Bitcoin. I downloaded the software but am unable to interact with the network.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# In\r\nbitcoin-cli getblocktemplate '{\"rules\": [\"segwit\"]}'\r\n# Out\r\nzsh: command not found: bitcoin-cli\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be clear instructions on how to install and get started using Bitcoin software that did not require extensive knowledge of software systems architecture and pathing. A great installation method would automatically install the software along the right path to prevent the pathing problem. A generalized solution would be really good, providing a clear guide to solving the pathing problem on any machine.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI've researched solving the problem in the [Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5365321.0) and on [StackOverflow](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/43148/bitcoin-cli-not-found-on-osx). However, because this common problem is so unique to each local machine, a clear or generalized solution is hard to develop. One specific solution I tried from my research was to add additional context to the command.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# In\r\n> curl --user username --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\": \"curltest\", \"method\": \"getblocktemplate\", \"params\": [{\"rules\": [\"segwit\"]}]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/\r\n# Out\r\n> curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 8332: Connection refused\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the command resulted in a connection refusal. I found a possible solution in the [Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5155612.0), but the problem with the proposed solution is that there is no `bitcoin.conf` file in the main Bitcoin repository. I found a `config` folder in the `src` directory, but there is no `bitcoin.conf` file. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI am running on MacOS. Thank you in advance for your attention and advice.\r\n",

As such, when looking at the `bitcoind -h` output, these can be considered headers. In the help output, you can easily distinguish the headers from options because they have different indentation. In the generated example introduced by this PR, there is no visual specialty, they are not so evident and get lost within all the other text. \r\n\r\nI suggest making the headers more visible. My current suggestion is to prepend another new line at the start of a new section and prepend the header text with more `#`. A benefit of making these headers more visible is that it will aid users find what they are looking for more quickly.\r\n\r\nin terms of a rule for your script, headers end with `:`. Additionally, you're skipping the first section header which is simply `Options:`",
