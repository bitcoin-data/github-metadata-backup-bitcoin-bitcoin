    "body": "This change improves debug.log output in the following ways:-\n\nIt reduces some duplicate output, and no longer needed output (which was originally added for testing).\n\nIt reduces the verbosity of output during initial block download, so rather than showing every block requested, it summarises. Once caught up, the previously level of verbosity is restored.\n\nInformation about the nodes connected are shown, and additional information about errors (particularly rejected transactions) are shown, with the offending peer alongside.\n\nRecent changes which add many lines, such as address handling have been kept in as this code is still relatively new - I was tempted to comment out various lines such as the \"tried...\", etc.\n\nTimestamps is now enabled by default. -nologtimestamps or logtimestamps=0 will disable this.\n\nAlso, renamed AlreadyAskedFor to AlreadyWaitingFor (makes more sense, as can cease waiting, but cannot stop having done a past thing.)\n",

      "body": "@gmaxwell Doesn't it make more sense to use the misbehaving function on a peer that you will _always_ disconnect whenever it connects? Why not use it?\n\nRe peer addresses: these are changes anyone could do anyway, it is useful debug info, especially when trying to work out why blocks aren't downloading as fast as they could be, or for troubleshooting code to determine network lag in general or per peer. The debug.log is chopped regularly, so there is usually no more than a day or two of logs. Would it help perhaps, if instead of showing IP addresses, it just used a unique number instead? The IP address itself isn't important, but correlating which of several peers is.\n\nRe timestamps, @jgarzik  - how is this a privacy implication? With timestamps off, the flushing of the wallet.dat is always timestamped, so a timestamp per line surely makes little difference, does it?\n",

Excessive logging endangers our users in several ways— beyond the lost privacy there is the risk of node operators being subject to frivolous fishing expedition investigations just to gather their logs, being hacked to use nodes to  trace back nodes, etc.\n\nI don't believe I've ever wanted addresses in the logs of someone elses node I was troubleshooting, except on rpc authentication failures. (I have wanted addresses on my own nodes too, but I can— as you point out— enable that locally).\n\nThe default logging behavior shouldn't reflect the logging we as developers user to build the software— it should reflect the logging we need to help users with mysterious behavior out in the field... and thats all.  If not for that need we wouldn't have logging at all.  \nRegarding timestamps— infrequent markers are not the same thing as timestamps on every message.\n",

Whereas a DoS change even if it works perfectly, could knock the whole network out— it requires a different kind of consideration. \n\nAs far as it goes, I think it actually is a bad change:  It means that when the old node gets upgraded he may be blacklisted by the whole network and not be able to get on for another 24 hours.  Because it costs basically no more to hang up due to the blacklist vs hang up at the addr message I don't see that it saves us anything.\n",

Anyway, here goes. Comments welcome.\n\nThis pull adds a command line argument \"-quietinitial\", which is intended to make the \"traffic\" in debug.log less so that the block download progress can be more easily seen. It's off by default, and without using it, things look the same as usual.\n\nI realise that some of what this does can be achieved with 3rd party log file filterers, but some of it can't, and it's mostly developers that use such 3rd party tools, and I'd like to help enable bitcoin to be useful to less technical people too.\n\nThis sub-pull, IMHO, isn't as useful unless combined with some of the other pull requests I've raised (and am still raising, due to hacking #1311 into smaller pieces).\n\nI suspect the others will need rebasing depending on what order the pulls are effected. ho hum..!\n\nHeh... #1337 is a cool pull number :) Not sure this one deserves such a number though!\n\nAnyway, comments welcomed - I need to get a better idea of what makes a good pull or not.\n",

(although there will be a pull request coming shortly providing a command line flag should peer information for all txs be desired).\n\nAlso, free transactions are identifies in the output. Not particularly useful, but these may become a rare thing in the not too distant future.. maybe, maybe not.\n\nApologies for the txnode variable. The only other way was to change all the functions to allow it to be passed.
