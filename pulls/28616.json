    "body": "Fixes #28598: currently if assumeutxo were to be used, transactions might get shown as confirmed even while the entire chainstate is unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nThis also adds an `assumed` value to `listtransactions` etc, shown only for confirmed transactions when a snapshot is loaded.\r\n\r\nThe UI experience for assume utxo still needs work. This PR makes the wallet UI safer by not rendering transactions as fully confirmed until the background validation is done.\r\n\r\nInstead it shows the same icon as when a transaction has 1 confirmation. This is quite conservative. The cost of tricking someone into accepting a fake coin, by giving them a invalid snapshot`*` and then mining a block on top of it, is higher than a regular doublespend by mining.\r\n\r\n![pending](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/10217/a2a95190-a1a7-402e-822b-b0829d5bdf45)\r\n\r\n`* =` in the current implementation this involves giving someone a malicious binary or getting them to recompile\r\n\r\nCaveat: because transaction state is updated after `blockConnected`, if you restart the node during background sync, then the transaction will show as fully confirmed (`\"assumed\": false`) briefly - until the next block is connected.",

Since we don't show background validation progress yet in the GUI, this glitch would only be noticed by someone looking at the log.\r\n\r\nNot sure how involved fixing that is.",

      "body": ">> Until you receive coins, there's no risk anyway.\r\n> Can you explain this?\r\n\r\nThe only thing a GUI wallet user can do is generate an address. This is safe whether or not IBD and background sync are complete, and regardless of if the snapshot hash was valid. Once they receive coins on that address it's useful to know if these coins are in their mempool, confirmed in a block but pending background sync, or confirmed in a fully validated chain.\r\n\r\n> attach a wallet over P2P to a node that has no wallet compiled in\r\n\r\nThere's no p2p message to communicate background validation state.\r\n\r\nA wallet that's connected over IPC (see #19461) should figure out it's own handling of this. The way process seperation is designed at the moment, I believe you can only connect the GUI to a remote Node + Wallet combo, so this PR would work. I.e. you can connect a GUI + wallet to a remote node, that would require rethinking the interface.\r\n\r\nI also don't think it's a good idea to make the GUI do more independent reasoning, e.g. taking confirmation height from the wallet interface, the background sync state from the node interface and then determining what to display. \r\n\r\n> Are you aware of the RPC call to get the state, which can be accessed via the UI.\r\n\r\nI assume we'll add a GUI menu option to load the snapshot soon enough. At that point relying on users calling an RPC method and interpreting the result, doesn't seem like a good idea. It's also safer to not rely on the user proactively checking if the background sync is done. Rather with this PR, they will see that the transaction is not fully confirmed, and if they're curious they can look at that RPC method.\r\n\r\n> putting it in the wallet doesn't seem right.\r\n\r\nI think we need to access background sync information in two places:\r\n1. The GUI sync progress indicator(s) \r\n2. The wallet\r\n\r\n(1) is independent of the wallet and not implemented in this PR. I don't think it would be sufficient. We should not expect users to automatically understand that a background sync in progress has implications for a confirmed transaction near the tip.",

For example, it is needed to populate the block storage with blocks (when pruning is disabled). Also, it is needed to populate the header tree structure with metadata, such as the transaction count of a block, or the transaction count of the chain. Finally, it serves as method to ensure it is always possible to sync from scratch. Otherwise, if snapshots were the popular choice, and they'd skip background download to save on resources, they may encourage to increase the resource usage to a point where snapshot syncs are the only technically possible way to IBD a fresh node.

It would need to be a flag that's applied to both the `TransactionStatus::Confirming` and `TransactionStatus::Confirmed` states. Patch is welcome, but otherwise it could be improved in a followup.\r\n\r\n> There are reasons for the background download.\r\n\r\nI agree there are additional benefits to doing the background sync, beyond verification.\r\n\r\nAlthough this:\r\n\r\n> populate the header tree structure with metadata, such as the transaction count of a block, or the transaction count of the chain\r\n\r\n... could be committed to separately - it's not consensus critical and overkill to have to download an entire block for.\r\n\r\nDownloading historical historical blocks is primarily useful to validate them, secondarily to serve them other nodes (for the same reason not everyone should run a pruned node).\r\n\r\n> may encourage to increase the resource usage\r\n\r\nIn this case I assume you're referring to future protocol changes that would encourage that? Because within the current protocol use (some) people already don't feel much restraint unfortunately. I suspect _time_ is the worst enemy, with linear growth over centuries being the biggest barrier to background sync. Unless Moore's Law doesn't stop and continues to offset this linear growth with exponential performance increase in bandwidth, CPU and I/O (Utreexo only fixes the I/O bottleneck).",

      "body": "Not related to the review of this PR, but I thought I'd follow up on my previous comment (let me know if you don't want me to do this). For the Bitcoin Core App, I am proposing to have show the verification status in the text field that we also use for the date and other statuses in transactions. Users can always click a transaction to see the date if they really need to. This keeps the list simple to parse, which is especially important on mobile. The general verification status is indicated in the mini block clock in the top-right (which also has a helpful tooltip), and the larger block clock when you navigate to that screen. More [here](https://bitcoincore.app/snapshot/), and all feedback is appreciated.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/695901/df60040f-3e37-4ad4-b164-20de29c018a8)\r\n",
