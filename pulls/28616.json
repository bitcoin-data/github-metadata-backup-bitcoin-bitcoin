    "body": "Fixes #28598: currently if assumeutxo were to be used, transactions might get shown as confirmed even while the entire chainstate is unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nThis also adds an `assumed` value to `listtransactions` etc, shown only for confirmed transactions when a snapshot is loaded.\r\n\r\nThe UI experience for assume utxo still needs work. This PR makes the wallet UI safer by not rendering transactions as fully confirmed until the background validation is done.\r\n\r\nInstead it shows the same icon as when a transaction has 1 confirmation. This is quite conservative. The cost of tricking someone into accepting a fake coin, by giving them a invalid snapshot`*` and then mining a block on top of it, is higher than a regular doublespend by mining.\r\n\r\n![pending](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/10217/a2a95190-a1a7-402e-822b-b0829d5bdf45)\r\n\r\n`* =` in the current implementation this involves giving someone a malicious binary or getting them to recompile\r\n\r\nCaveat: because transaction state is updated after `blockConnected`, if you restart the node during background sync, then the transaction will show as fully confirmed (`\"assumed\": false`) briefly - until the next block is connected.",

This TXO set is iterated for balance checking and coin selection preparation, which can still be slow for wallets that have had a lot of activity. This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

          "body": "- Background and FAQ: https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/2019-04-proposal/proposal\r\n- Prior progress/project: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/11\r\n- Replaces https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606, which was closed due to Github slowness. Original description and commentary can be found there.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis changeset finishes the first phase of the assumeutxo project. It makes UTXO snapshots loadable via RPC (`loadtxoutset`) and adds `assumeutxo` parameters to chainparams. It contains all the remaining changes necessary to both use an assumedvalid snapshot chainstate and do a full validation sync in the background.\r\n\r\nThis may look like a lot to review, but note that\r\n- ~200 lines are a (non-essential) demo shell script\r\n- Many lines are functional test, documentation, and relatively dilute RPC code.\r\n\r\nSo it shouldn't be as burdensome to review as the linecount might suggest.\r\n\r\n- **P2P**: minor changes are made to `init.cpp` and `net_processing.cpp` to make simultaneous IBD across multiple chainstates work.\r\n- **Pruning**: implement correct pruning behavior when using a background chainstate\r\n- **Blockfile separation**: to prevent \"fragmentation\" in blockfile storage, have background chainstates use separate blockfiles from active snapshot chainstates to avoid interleaving heights and impairing pruning.\r\n- **Indexing**: some `CValidationInterface` events are given with an additional parameter, ChainstateRole, and all indexers ignore events from ChainstateRole::ASSUMEDVALID so that indexation only happens sequentially.\r\n- Have `-reindex` properly wipe snapshot chainstates.\r\n- **RPC**: introduce RPC commands `loadtxoutset` and (hidden) `getchainstates`.\r\n- **Release docs & first assumeutxo commitment**: add notes and a particular assumeutxo hash value for first AU-enabled release.\r\n  - This will complete the project and allow use of UTXO snapshots for faster node bootstrap.\r\n\r\nThe next phase, if it were to be pursued, would be coming up with a way to distribute the UTXO snapshots over the P2P network.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### UTXO snapshots\r\n\r\nCreate your own with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh`, e.g. \r\n```shell\r\n./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh 788000 utxo.dat ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$(pwd)/testdata`)\r\n```\r\nor use the pre-generated ones listed below.\r\n\r\n- Testnet: **2'500'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:511e09f4bf853aefab00de5c070b1e031f0ecbe9&dn=utxo-testnet-2500000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n  - sha256: `79db4b025448cc0ac388d8589a28eab02de53055d181e34eb47391717aa16388`\r\n- Signet: **160'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:9da986cb27b3980ea7fd06b21e199b148d486880&dn=utxo-signet-160000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n  - sha256: `eeeca845385ba91e84ef58c09d38f98f246a24feadaad57fe1e5874f3f92ef8c`\r\n- Mainnet: **800'000** (Sjors):\r\n  - Note: this needs the following commit cherry-picked in: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/commit/24deb2022b822f22fba9fcbee201e37a83225eb2\r\n  - torrent: `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:50ee955bef37f5ec3e5b0df4cf0288af3d715a2e&dn=utxo-800000.dat&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl%3A6969`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### For fun (~5min)\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a quick test, you can run `./contrib/devtools/test_utxo_snapshots.sh` and follow the instructions. This is mostly obviated by the functional tests, though.\r\n\r\n#### For real (longer)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience a real usage of assumeutxo, you can do that too.\r\nI've cut a new snapshot at height 788'000 (http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat - but you can do it yourself with `./contrib/devtools/utxo_snapshot.sh` if you want). Download that, and then create a datadir for testing:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd ~/src/bitcoin  # or whatever\r\n\r\n# get the snapshot\r\n$ curl http://img.jameso.be/utxo-788000.dat > utxo-788000.dat\r\n\r\n# you'll want to do this if you like copy/pasting \r\n$ export AU_DATADIR=/home/${USER}/au-test # or wherever\r\n\r\n$ mkdir ${AU_DATADIR}\r\n$ vim ${AU_DATADIR}/bitcoin.conf\r\n\r\ndbcache=8000  # or, you know, something high\r\nblockfilterindex=1\r\ncoinstatsindex=1\r\nprune=3000\r\nlogthreadnames=1\r\n```\r\nObtain this branch, build it, and then start bitcoind:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git remote add jamesob https://github.com/jamesob/bitcoin\r\n$ git fetch jamesob assumeutxo\r\n$ git checkout jamesob/assumeutxo\r\n\r\n$ ./configure $conf_args && make  # (whatever you like to do here)\r\n\r\n# start 'er up and watch the logs\r\n$ ./src/bitcoind -datadir=${AU_DATADIR}\r\n```\r\nThen, in some other window, load the snapshot\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} loadtxoutset $(pwd)/utxo-788000.dat\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see some log messages about headers retrieval and waiting to see the snapshot in the headers chain. Once you get the full headers chain, you'll spend a decent amount of time (~10min) loading the snapshot, checking it, and flushing it to disk. After all that happens, you should be syncing to tip in pretty short order, and you'll see the occasional `[background validation]` log message go by.\r\n\r\nIn yet another window, you can check out chainstate status with\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${AU_DATADIR} getchainstates\r\n```\r\nas well as usual favorites like `getblockchaininfo`.",

      "body": ">> Until you receive coins, there's no risk anyway.\r\n> Can you explain this?\r\n\r\nThe only thing a GUI wallet user can do is generate an address. This is safe whether or not IBD and background sync are complete, and regardless of if the snapshot hash was valid. Once they receive coins on that address it's useful to know if these coins are in their mempool, confirmed in a block but pending background sync, or confirmed in a fully validated chain.\r\n\r\n> attach a wallet over P2P to a node that has no wallet compiled in\r\n\r\nThere's no p2p message to communicate background validation state.\r\n\r\nA wallet that's connected over IPC (see #19461) should figure out it's own handling of this. The way process seperation is designed at the moment, I believe you can only connect the GUI to a remote Node + Wallet combo, so this PR would work. I.e. you can connect a GUI + wallet to a remote node, that would require rethinking the interface.\r\n\r\nI also don't think it's a good idea to make the GUI do more independent reasoning, e.g. taking confirmation height from the wallet interface, the background sync state from the node interface and then determining what to display. \r\n\r\n> Are you aware of the RPC call to get the state, which can be accessed via the UI.\r\n\r\nI assume we'll add a GUI menu option to load the snapshot soon enough. At that point relying on users calling an RPC method and interpreting the result, doesn't seem like a good idea. It's also safer to not rely on the user proactively checking if the background sync is done. Rather with this PR, they will see that the transaction is not fully confirmed, and if they're curious they can look at that RPC method.\r\n\r\n> putting it in the wallet doesn't seem right.\r\n\r\nI think we need to access background sync information in two places:\r\n1. The GUI sync progress indicator(s) \r\n2. The wallet\r\n\r\n(1) is independent of the wallet and not implemented in this PR. I don't think it would be sufficient. We should not expect users to automatically understand that a background sync in progress has implications for a confirmed transaction near the tip.",

          "body": "## Goals of this issue\r\n\r\n- Track all ongoing work on assumeutxo until mainnet params are included in a release\r\n- Categorize the work into critical/optional for mainnet readiness\r\n- Conceptual discussion on assumeutxo topics that may or may not be critical for mainnet readiness\r\n\r\nThe initial categorizations here are suggestions and changes should be discussed here in the issue. Obviously let me know if I missed anything.\r\n\r\n## Critical Issues/PRs\r\n\r\n- [ ] #29612 (which fixes #25675) - Improves size of dump, critical because it is not backwards compatible\r\n- [ ] #29519 - Stop syncing non-snapshot chain from peers that are already connected\r\n- [ ] #29726 - Fix -reindex behavior\r\n- [x] #29370 - Get rid of faked nTx and nChainTx values (closing issues discussed in #29261)\r\n- [ ] #28553 - The mainnet params themselves\r\n\r\n## Optional Issues/PRs\r\n\r\n(Attempted a rough ordering by importance)\r\n\r\n- [ ] #28616 (which fixes #28598) - Show background chain funds as not fully confirmed in GUI\r\n- [ ] #29553 - `dumptxoutset` with height param\r\n- [ ] #28670 - Improved error handling for `loadtxoutset`\r\n- [x] #29478 - Additional test coverage for `loadtxoutset`\r\n- [ ] #29617 - Additional test coverage\r\n- [ ] #29428 (draft) - Additional test coverage\r\n- [ ] #28608 (draft) - State and locking cleanup\r\n\r\n## Critical conceptual discussion\r\n\r\n- [ ] Agreement on a rule of thumb which height we choose once there is consensus for mainnet readiness, i.e. how to choose the height for #28553 once we are close to an upcoming release. I think the earlier we discuss this the better, so that this doesn't get in the way later.\r\n\r\n## Optional conceptual discussion\r\n\r\nThese were taken from #28553 and [the original assumeutxo PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27596#issuecomment-1727936044).\r\n\r\n- [ ] Distribution of snapshots - This recently came up [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29551#pullrequestreview-1917416713) and [here](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2024-03-07#1012635;). There are multiple levels to this topic but I believe that this is not critical either way. If it were critical then, at the most basic level, we would probably provide an \"official\" torrent/download link for the dump with the release. It would be great if one or more contributors could do that (@Sjors did this in #28516 for example) and are willing to maintain this for a reasonable amount of time but it is not critical IMO because anyone can use `dumptxoutset` to recreate the dump and then share it any way they like. So there is no need to provide this service from within the project. I think anyone who plans to distribute the dump to other users (think of downstream projects like BTCPayServer, Raspiblitz, Umbrel, Greenlight etc.) should validate the dump like this at least once anyway. And there may even be options for distribution possible for downstream projects that we can not even think of right now but if we don't make the feature available they can also not be explored.\r\n- [ ] Usage of MuHash #27669 - While it would be nice to have this I don't think it is blocking because this can still be introduced later without invalidating existing dumps.\r\n- [ ] Make params configurable/not hardcoded params - I think it would be good to stay on the safe side for now and make the feature available to the public as originally planned. If the feature sees wide adoption and requests for more flexibility come in that would be the right point to explore this further.\r\n- [ ] Should old hashes be removed from source code at some point? - Obviously not relevant for the first mainnet params\r\n- [ ] How frequently should we update testnet/signet params and is there any way to deal with the possibility that these chains [may get nuked at some point](https://x.com/kallewoof/status/1763222648367308958)?",

If we then show transactions but communicate to users that they should not really trust what is shown, it does not feel like the wallet is actually ready, which defeats the purpose of the feature.

Before assumeutxo, when a user creates a new wallet and receives coins while the blockchain is still downloading, they would not see those coins. Now they do see the coins, and they can spend them.\r\n\r\nBut until the background validation is complete, there is a different trust assumption. It's safer than an unconfirmed transaction, because we can check the proof-of-work. It's about the same as an SPV wallet, which only checks the headers and a merkle inclusion proof.\r\n\r\nOnly if you fully trust that the development process prevented a malicious / buggy snapshot from being included, can you treat it as fully equivalent to the scenario where you completed background validation. But in that case, you might as well not run the background validation at all - yet we do. So I think we should make these transactions (somehow) look a little less final.",

A transaction having 1 confirmation does not communicate very closely that the transaction has 7, but that those 7 have not been fully verified. Another treatment could be to show the full verification icon, but grey it out. \r\n\r\nWe'll also have to resolve this for the [Bitcoin Core App](https://bitcoincore.app/milestones/1-5-activity/).",

So far, the application can only create and manage wallets, but there is no balance or transaction list.

Transactions and...? Will we eventually have things like key rotation, backup reminders, or otherwise?\r\n- Do we want to offer search and filter options for the activity list?\r\n- What are all the transaction states we need to offer? This would be great to have a spec'd list.\r\n\r\nSome cleaned-up designs from last years explorations:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Bitcoin-Core-App/assets/695901/429922a6-a006-495c-8e91-447cb24058d7)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Bitcoin-Core-App/assets/695901/048af883-7f79-490b-98c6-7deac63becec)\r\n\r\n",

For example, it is needed to populate the block storage with blocks (when pruning is disabled). Also, it is needed to populate the header tree structure with metadata, such as the transaction count of a block, or the transaction count of the chain. Finally, it serves as method to ensure it is always possible to sync from scratch. Otherwise, if snapshots were the popular choice, and they'd skip background download to save on resources, they may encourage to increase the resource usage to a point where snapshot syncs are the only technically possible way to IBD a fresh node.

Patch is welcome, but otherwise it could be improved in a followup.\r\n\r\n> There are reasons for the background download.\r\n\r\nI agree there are additional benefits to doing the background sync, beyond verification.\r\n\r\nAlthough this:\r\n\r\n> populate the header tree structure with metadata, such as the transaction count of a block, or the transaction count of the chain\r\n\r\n... could be committed to separately - it's not consensus critical and overkill to have to download an entire block for.\r\n\r\nDownloading historical historical blocks is primarily useful to validate them, secondarily to serve them other nodes (for the same reason not everyone should run a pruned node).\r\n\r\n> may encourage to increase the resource usage\r\n\r\nIn this case I assume you're referring to future protocol changes that would encourage that? Because within the current protocol use (some) people already don't feel much restraint unfortunately. I suspect _time_ is the worst enemy, with linear growth over centuries being the biggest barrier to background sync. Unless Moore's Law doesn't stop and continues to offset this linear growth with exponential performance increase in bandwidth, CPU and I/O (Utreexo only fixes the I/O bottleneck).",
