    "body": "This is an implementation of https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0135.mediawiki .\r\n\r\nIt extends the BIP9 state machine processing with configurable per-bit window size, activation threshold and grace period parameters (minlockedblocks and minlockedtime).\r\n\r\nThe built-in deployments are parameterized to maintain backward compatibility, and the existing BIP9 tests are retained unmodified except for a minor fix made to `versionbits_tests` to improve the disjointness checks for configured bits).\r\n\r\nA `bip135_forks` section has been added to the `getblockchaininfo` RPC output, leaving the existing `bip9_softforks` section for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe check for 'unknown versions being mined' has been altered to take into account that for unknown bits, we can no longer rely on a 95% activation threshold. The `p2p-versionbits-warning` test has been modified accordingly - the new logic warns when an unknown bit exceeds 50/100 of the last blocks.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This implementation contains a specific feature which is not covered by the specification (and thus not strictly required for BIP135): the optional loading of fork configuration from a CSV file (using `-forks=datafile` command line option) and the ability to dump out the built-in configuration in CSV format (`-dumpforks` option). This has been retained from the original reference implementation since it makes testing and adaptation of the configuration easier.",

Others have suggested to be able to specify it using multiple `-bip135=<data>` arguments, which would be another option.\r\n\r\nI did not really want to mix this fork configuration with the users existing config file, as it seems something which which ordinary users should not really tinker.",

The `p2p-versionbits-warning` test has been modified accordingly -\nthe new logic warns when an unknown bit exceeds 50/100 of the last blocks.\n\nNOTE: This implementation contains a specific feature which is not covered by the\nspecification (and thus not strictly required for BIP135): the optional loading of\nfork configuration from a CSV file (using `-forks=datafile` command line option)\nand the ability to dump out the built-in configuration in CSV format\n(`-dumpforks` option). This has been retained from the original reference\nimplementation since it makes testing and adaptation of the configuration easier.",
