    "body": "This library has existed for nearly 10 years with very little known uptake or impact. It has become a maintenance burden. In several cases it dictates our code/library structure (for example necessitating LIBBITCOIN_CRYPTO_BASE), as well as build-system procedures (building multiple copies of object files especially for the lib).\r\n\r\nSeveral discussions have arisen wrt migrating it to CMake and it has become difficult to justify adding more complexity for a library that is virtually unused anyway.\r\n\r\nSee for example the discussions:\r\nhttps://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/41\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29123\r\n\r\nAnd here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29180\r\nWhere it is pointed out that the libbitcoinconsensus functions are slower than those the internal bitcoind equivalents due to the missing sha2 implementations.\r\n\r\nInstead, we (fanquake, hebasto, TheCharlatan, and I) propose simply not migrating it to CMake and letting it end with v27. Any remaining use-cases could be handled in the future by libbitcoinkernel.\r\n\r\nIf there are any users currently using libbitcoinconsensus, please chime in with your use-case!\r\n\r\nEdit: Corrected final release to be v27.",

      "body": "Thank you, @1thales, for the ping.\r\n\r\nI'm building a lightweight Bitcoin full node called [Floresta](https://github.com/Davidson-Souza/Floresta), and I'm using `libbitcoinconsensus` through `rust-bitcoinconsensus`. I would rather not reimplement the entire script interpreter logic, given the complexity of keeping this code consensus-compatible with core. I did reimplement some consensus logic, but tx validation and script interpreter are the hardest ones to. `libbitcoinconsensus` has some issues, for example `libbitcoinconsensus` doesn't validate relative locktimes like `CSV`. I would prefer validating everything, including those.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I've exchanged some emails with @TheCharlatan about `libbitcoinkernel`, which is a great project. However, as it is, can't be used by `Floresta` because it relies on core's block-storage and `leveldb`. Since `floresta` is built using `utreexo`, we can't need those. \r\n\r\nIf `libbitcoinkernel` exposes stateless block/tx validation, that is, I give the transaction[s], the inputs and some context like block hash and MTP, and it spits out a \"valid\" or \"not valid because X\"; I would start using it as replacement without problems.\r\n",
