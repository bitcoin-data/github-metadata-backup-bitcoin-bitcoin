    "body": "This library has existed for nearly 10 years with very little known uptake or impact. It has become a maintenance burden. In several cases it dictates our code/library structure (for example necessitating LIBBITCOIN_CRYPTO_BASE), as well as build-system procedures (building multiple copies of object files especially for the lib).\r\n\r\nSeveral discussions have arisen wrt migrating it to CMake and it has become difficult to justify adding more complexity for a library that is virtually unused anyway.\r\n\r\nSee for example the discussions:\r\nhttps://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/41\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29123\r\n\r\nAnd here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29180\r\nWhere it is pointed out that the libbitcoinconsensus functions are slower than those the internal bitcoind equivalents due to the missing sha2 implementations.\r\n\r\nInstead, we (fanquake, hebasto, TheCharlatan, and I) propose simply not migrating it to CMake and letting it end with v27. Any remaining use-cases could be handled in the future by libbitcoinkernel.\r\n\r\nIf there are any users currently using libbitcoinconsensus, please chime in with your use-case!\r\n\r\nEdit: Corrected final release to be v27.",

      "body": "Thank you, @1thales, for the ping.\r\n\r\nI'm building a lightweight Bitcoin full node called [Floresta](https://github.com/Davidson-Souza/Floresta), and I'm using `libbitcoinconsensus` through `rust-bitcoinconsensus`. I would rather not reimplement the entire script interpreter logic, given the complexity of keeping this code consensus-compatible with core. I did reimplement some consensus logic, but tx validation and script interpreter are the hardest ones to. `libbitcoinconsensus` has some issues, for example `libbitcoinconsensus` doesn't validate relative locktimes like `CSV`. I would prefer validating everything, including those.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I've exchanged some emails with @TheCharlatan about `libbitcoinkernel`, which is a great project. However, as it is, can't be used by `Floresta` because it relies on core's block-storage and `leveldb`. Since `floresta` is built using `utreexo`, we can't need those. \r\n\r\nIf `libbitcoinkernel` exposes stateless block/tx validation, that is, I give the transaction[s], the inputs and some context like block hash and MTP, and it spits out a \"valid\" or \"not valid because X\"; I would start using it as replacement without problems.\r\n",

          "body": "The `script/bitcoinconsensus` module defines the public interface for the `bitcoinconsensus` library. Even though this module is only required by the tests and the `bitcoinconsensus` library, it is currently compiled into the static internal `libbitcoin_consensus` library, and therefore used by a bunch of build targets that do not require it.\r\n\r\nSince it is always part of the internal library, the `HAVE_CONSENSUS_LIB` define used by the tests is essentially\r\nmeaningless, since the module is always available. This can be verified on master by removing the `HAVE_CONSENSUS_LIB` checks in the tests, configuring with `--with-libs=no`, and running `make check`.\r\n\r\nImprove all of this by including the `bitcoinconsensus` module only where it is required and removing the `HAVE_CONSENSUS_LIB` define.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this patch was discussed in https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/41: Actually linking the test binaries with the external consensus library if it is available. This has the disadvantage though that if the dynamic consensus library is built, it has to be available for the test binaries to load whenever and wherever they are being run.\r\n\r\n",

While I found it beneficial for cross-testing complex scripts, the absence of core policy rule checking became a notable drawback.\r\n\r\nWe've transitioned our projects to utilize the [bitcoind](https://crates.io/crates/bitcoind) crate, incorporating integration tests akin to BitcoinTestFramework in the core.

The reviewing process is happening in this [repo](https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin) as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27060#issuecomment-1431798320.\r\n3. The recent discussion at CoreDev -- https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-09/cmake/\r\n\r\nHow reviewing happens:\r\n1. Pull requests are opened against the https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/tree/cmake-staging branch.\r\n2. After reviewing and merging them, the staging branch get synced with the main branch from this repo.\r\n4. This loop continues until all commits from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797 get reviewed.\r\n\r\nThe planned chunks of work:\r\n- [x] The root `CMakeLists.txt` and `config/bitcoin-config.h` files -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/5\r\n- [x] Project-wide system introspections; the `leveldb` build target -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/6\r\n- [x] The `bitcoind` build target -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/7\r\n- [x] Cross-compiling support -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/10\r\n- [x] Ccache support; `libnatpmp`, `libminiupnpc`, `libzmq` and `systemtap-sdt` optional packages support -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/13\r\n- [x] Utility binaries, wallet functionality, `bench_bitcoin` and `test_bitcoin` -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/15\r\n- [x] Handling different build configurations -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/18\r\n- [x] Hardening, shared libraries -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/32\r\n- ~Build `libbitcoinconsensus` library -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/41~ See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29189\r\n- [x] Qt stuff -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/77\r\n- [x] Guix builds -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/67\r\n- [x] Building for fuzzing -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/43\r\n- [ ] multiprocess support -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/118\r\n- [ ] CI stuff\r\n- [ ] `libbitcoin-kernel` and `bitcoin-chainstate`\r\n- [ ] Building for Android\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n~The current minimum required CMake version is 3.13, which is the system [package](https://packages.debian.org/buster/cmake) on [Debian 10](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/). Considering the timings of Debian 10 LTS EOL and integrating CMake into this repo, it seems reasonable to bump the minimum supported version up to 3.16, which is the system [package](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/cmake) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.~\r\n\r\n- [x] Bump minimum supported CMake version from 3.13 up to 3.16 -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/33\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo hold the 100% feature parity, the current CMake-based build system implementation can autodetect an optional package and enable it as Autotools-based one does. However, it was suggested to make all optional package opt-in by default. See:\r\n- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/12#discussion_r1156251913\r\n- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/12#discussion_r1157570678\r\n- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/13#discussion_r1164377093\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make all optional package opt-in by default\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAutotools -- CMake Feature Parity Table is available [here](https://gist.github.com/hebasto/2ef97d3a726bfce08ded9df07f7dab5e).\r\n\r\nTo list CMake's options, one might add the `-LH` option during configuring step.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdated build docs:\r\n- [Building Bitcoin Core with Visual Studio](https://gist.github.com/hebasto/32c77c0cd592d13685437271ac6b79f6)",

          "body": "This PR adds a `SigVersion` parameter to `IsOpSuccess()`. This is needed to make continued progress on #29221 . \r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nAs per [BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki#rationale)\r\n>Given that OP_SUCCESSx even causes potentially unparseable scripts to pass, it can be used to introduce multi-byte opcodes, or even a completely new scripting language when prefixed with a specific OP_SUCCESSx opcode.\r\n\r\nThis is occurring on #29221, in [script_assets_test.json](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/blob/main/unit_test_data/script_assets_test.json) there exists a witness redeemScript `de4c`. In #29221 this translates to `OP_GREATHERTHAN64 OP_PUSHDATA1`.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at parsing logic for [`GetScriptOp`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3d52cedb497e0ec029ba3cef95b00169c157d8ae/src/script/script.cpp#L310) we see that `OP_PUSHDATA1` requires a data element following it to specify the push size. Since this is not available, the script fails to parse and thus fails the entire script.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nMake `IsOpSuccess()` dependent on `SigVersion`. Now for `SigVersion::TAPSCRIPT` leaf versions, we retain the `OP_SUCCESSx` semantics, thus trivially parsing and passing the witness redeemScript `de4c`\r\n\r\nIf you want to see how this works with #29221, please see this commit that shows this logic working in tandem with the new op codes proposed in the 64 bit arithmetic BIP:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1538\r\n- https://github.com/Christewart/bitcoin/commits/64bit-arith-script-asset-debug/\r\n",

      "body": "Could you clarify what deprecation will actually mean for 27.0, and then the future steps?\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand. this PR removes a bunch of tests, and adds a sentence to a doc saying that it is deprecated. I think that means we will still be building the library by default but not testing it? That seems a bit odd to me, and I would rather that testing is deleted at the same time the library is removed, unless there is some reason that those tests can be removed that is unrelated to the deprecation.\r\n\r\nIf we do deprecate this, then all downstream users need to be made aware that it is going away and that they have a plan to move away from it. I don't like leaving our users out to dry.\r\n\r\nFor 27.0 specifically, I think this needs a release note. Release notes at least have some expectation of being read regularly, so a deprecation notice in there would be beneficial. We could also disable building the library for release builds so that those who do not read the release notes will find out that the library was deprecated. As it will still be available in the source, they can still compile it themselves if they need it.",

      "body": "@achow101/ @ajtowns  Looking again, I agree the order of operations here probably looks a little strange.\r\n\r\nFor context, most of this discussion came out of the discussion about porting this to CMake. We went in circles for months trying to decide how to best port this over to CMake, but we eventually got together and asked ourselves: should we even bother? Does anyone actually use this?\r\n\r\nThis PR was our way of fact-finding. It's a pretty resounding \"no\". The lib has been around since 2014 and it's pretty clear that it's just not that useful. It can check tx scripts statically, but without a stateful UTXO set there's very little utility in that. Libbitcoinkernel, which is currently in progress (and which bitcoin-chainstate demonstrates), is already capable of doing much more interesting things, it just doesn't have a defined api yet.\r\n\r\nThis PR intended to serve 3 functions:\r\n- Gauge any ongoing need (if any) to maintain the lib\r\n- Deprecate it and prepare for removal\r\n- Remove the bits that are getting in the way of the CMake migration\r\n\r\nIt seems there's a general (not 100%, but there never is) agreement on the first and second: it's ok to deprecate now and remove for v28.\r\n\r\nFor the third, it probably looks like we've jumped the gun a bit. The idea was that these tests really aren't testing anything interesting at all. They're just generally covering checks that are done elsewhere, but wrapped around the libbitcoinconsensus apis.\r\n\r\nI concede that removing the tests for a lib that we're still shipping is not ideal. This came more from thinking about the CMake transtion than anything else, but considering that we don't believe that the tests are actually interesting, it seemed reasonable enough. \r\n\r\nRather than spending time arguing about removing some silly tests, I think there's a compromise here: Let's do the deprecation now (the readme changes as well as a release note as suggested by @achow101 above) and plan to just do the lib removal first thing after branch-off. That way we have our assurances that we can simply skip the port on the CMake side so it won't slow anything down there.\r\n\r\nSound good?",

That way we have our assurances that we can simply skip the port on the CMake side so it won't slow anything down there.\r\n> \r\n> Sound good?\r\n\r\nYeah, that's exactly what I was expecting fwiw.",

In several cases it dictates our\ncode/library structure (for example necessitating LIBBITCOIN_CRYPTO_BASE), as\nwell as build-system procedures (building multiple copies of object files\nespecially for the lib).\n\nSeveral discussions have arisen wrt migrating it to CMake and it has become\ndifficult to justify adding more complexity for a library that is virtually\nunused anyway.\n\nSee for example the discussions:\nhttps://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/41\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29123\n\nInstead, we (fanquake, hebasto, TheCharlatan, and I) propose simply not\nmigrating it to CMake and letting it end with v27. Any remaining use-cases\ncould be handled in the future by libbitcoinkernel.",

      "body": "Hey, I had a use case: create a chain of transactions in WASM (browser) in a multiparty protocol where the child transaction must be verified before signing their parents. The inputs of the parent are controlled by the verifying user so there's no \"you need a full node anyway\" argument. Thus `libbitcoinkernel` is not the solution. Now in my case the template is simple enough to not need `libbitcoinconsensus` - it's fine to just verify the signatures. But being able to just run the same code as Core would be very reassuring that there isn't an attack vector where the counterparty could produce invalid transaction that the client thinks is valid and I wonder if there is any other project that would need more complex verification.\r\n\r\nThere's another similar idea I had a long time ago: when ordering a node-in-a-box one could pre-open the channels during payment in the browser (same transaction) so one doesn't need to wait for channel opens after the node arrives and saves fees. However I'm not familiar with LN inner workings enough to tell whether `libbitcoinconsensus` would be needed for this. If the LN people could clarify this it'd be nice.\r\n\r\nAlso please note that I find the announcement period super short. This wasn't loudly communicated and if I wasn't a co-maintainer of rust-bitcoin I wouldn't have known. And even then I'm already writing this post-merge. I'd really appreciate if there was more time given and louder announcements for breaking changes in the future.",
