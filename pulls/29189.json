    "body": "This library has existed for nearly 10 years with very little known uptake or impact. It has become a maintenance burden. In several cases it dictates our code/library structure (for example necessitating LIBBITCOIN_CRYPTO_BASE), as well as build-system procedures (building multiple copies of object files especially for the lib).\r\n\r\nSeveral discussions have arisen wrt migrating it to CMake and it has become difficult to justify adding more complexity for a library that is virtually unused anyway.\r\n\r\nSee for example the discussions:\r\nhttps://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/41\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29123\r\n\r\nAnd here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29180\r\nWhere it is pointed out that the libbitcoinconsensus functions are slower than those the internal bitcoind equivalents due to the missing sha2 implementations.\r\n\r\nInstead, we (fanquake, hebasto, TheCharlatan, and I) propose simply not migrating it to CMake and letting it end with v27. Any remaining use-cases could be handled in the future by libbitcoinkernel.\r\n\r\nIf there are any users currently using libbitcoinconsensus, please chime in with your use-case!\r\n\r\nEdit: Corrected final release to be v27.",

      "body": "Thank you, @1thales, for the ping.\r\n\r\nI'm building a lightweight Bitcoin full node called [Floresta](https://github.com/Davidson-Souza/Floresta), and I'm using `libbitcoinconsensus` through `rust-bitcoinconsensus`. I would rather not reimplement the entire script interpreter logic, given the complexity of keeping this code consensus-compatible with core. I did reimplement some consensus logic, but tx validation and script interpreter are the hardest ones to. `libbitcoinconsensus` has some issues, for example `libbitcoinconsensus` doesn't validate relative locktimes like `CSV`. I would prefer validating everything, including those.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I've exchanged some emails with @TheCharlatan about `libbitcoinkernel`, which is a great project. However, as it is, can't be used by `Floresta` because it relies on core's block-storage and `leveldb`. Since `floresta` is built using `utreexo`, we can't need those. \r\n\r\nIf `libbitcoinkernel` exposes stateless block/tx validation, that is, I give the transaction[s], the inputs and some context like block hash and MTP, and it spits out a \"valid\" or \"not valid because X\"; I would start using it as replacement without problems.\r\n",

          "body": "The `script/bitcoinconsensus` module defines the public interface for the `bitcoinconsensus` library. Even though this module is only required by the tests and the `bitcoinconsensus` library, it is currently compiled into the static internal `libbitcoin_consensus` library, and therefore used by a bunch of build targets that do not require it.\r\n\r\nSince it is always part of the internal library, the `HAVE_CONSENSUS_LIB` define used by the tests is essentially\r\nmeaningless, since the module is always available. This can be verified on master by removing the `HAVE_CONSENSUS_LIB` checks in the tests, configuring with `--with-libs=no`, and running `make check`.\r\n\r\nImprove all of this by including the `bitcoinconsensus` module only where it is required and removing the `HAVE_CONSENSUS_LIB` define.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this patch was discussed in https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/41: Actually linking the test binaries with the external consensus library if it is available. This has the disadvantage though that if the dynamic consensus library is built, it has to be available for the test binaries to load whenever and wherever they are being run.\r\n\r\n",

While I found it beneficial for cross-testing complex scripts, the absence of core policy rule checking became a notable drawback.\r\n\r\nWe've transitioned our projects to utilize the [bitcoind](https://crates.io/crates/bitcoind) crate, incorporating integration tests akin to BitcoinTestFramework in the core. Though the setup might be a bit clunky, I believe(as of now) there is no substitute to running core node to check if a transaction satisfies core policy rules. ",
