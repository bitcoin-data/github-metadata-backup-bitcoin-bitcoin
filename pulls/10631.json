Clang does this.\r\nI don't think this can be as bad as `Wshadow`, where different versions of compilers had different interpretations. Also new classes aren't introduced *that* frequently.\r\nSo I think it's ok...\r\n",

As they work in the opposite direction through the inheritance hierarchy I don't see why one would be a replacement for the other?\r\n\r\n> Our dependencies don't necessarily use them, so we're flooded with warnings for qt/protobufs/leveldb.\r\n\r\nThat's a good point.
