    "body": "During coin selection, there are various places where we need to have a feerate. We need the feerate for the transaction itself, the discard fee rate, and long term feerate. Fetching these each time we need them can lead to a race condition where two feerates that should be the same are actually different. One particular instance where this can happen is during the loop in `CreateTransactionInternal`. After inputs are chosen, the expected transaction fee is calculated using a newly fetched feerate. If `pick_new_inputs == false`, the loop will go again with the assumption that the fee for the transaction remains the same. However because the feerate is fetched again, it is possible that it actually isn't and this causes coin selection to fail.\r\n\r\nInstead of fetching the feerate each time it is needed, we fetch them all at once at the top of `CreateTransactionInternal`, store them in `CoinSelectionParams`, and use them where needed.\r\n\r\nWhile some of these fee rates probably don't need this caching, I've done it for consistency and the guarantee that they remain the same.\r\n\r\nFixes #19229",

It sounded like it was a particular tx that caused these issues, rather than it just happening inconsistently on different txs which would seem more reasonable if a volatile fee market is the cause for this. But I have stared at the code for a pretty long time now (particularly the `subtractfeefromamount` scenario because that was mentioned several times in #19229) and I couldn't find another edge case that might cause this error. So I think the best path forward is to try and see if this code fixes the issue for those that have observed it. At least one user has already indicated in #19229 that they didn't see the issue again after running this PR so that's a good sign.",

Also these changes add to a proliferation of CoinSelectionParams constructor arguments can get easily confused together.\r\n\r\nA safer approach might be to make these `std::optional<CFeeRate>` members instead of `CFeeRate` members so the CoinSelectionParams constructor doesn't have to be involved with them at all. Then they can be directly set by name, and explicit errors will be triggered if they are ever accessed without being set.\r\n",

Russ's suggestion of using std::optionals is good. Alternatively, I think these small changes would make things more readable:\r\n\r\n- add line breaks to the declaration and call sites, so there aren't 200+ column lines\r\n- add doxygen comments to the members so it's obvious what they're doing\r\n- use inline comments in the call sites:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-CoinSelectionParams coin_selection_params(false, 0, 0, CFeeRate(0), CFeeRate(0), CFeeRate(0), 0, false);\r\n+CoinSelectionParams coin_selection_params(/* use_bnb= */ false, /* change_output_size= */ 0,\r\n+                                          /* change_spend_size= */ 0, /* effective_fee= */ CFeeRate(0),\r\n+                                          /* long_term_feerate= */ CFeeRate(0), /* discard_feerate= */ CFeeRate(0),\r\n+                                          /* tx_noinputs_size= */ 0, /* avoid_partial= */ false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nc++20 will bring [designated initializers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization), which make initializing large structs like this much more readable.
