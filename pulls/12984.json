      "body": "@jnewbery Thanks for the review! I'm now using `%f`.\r\n\r\nI'm scratching my own itch here: I interact with `bitcoind` solely via the command-line and I find the column jumping due to the `log2_work` formatting to make the output harder to read (my logs consist almost solely of `UpdateTip` messages) :-)\r\n\r\nUsability is about making the overall experience more pleasant (often by small incremental improvements) – not necessarily \"fixing issues\" :-)\r\n\r\nIn my experience `height` and `tx` are not a problem in the same way since they only jump to the right on 10x increases.\r\n\r\nPlease re-review :-)",
