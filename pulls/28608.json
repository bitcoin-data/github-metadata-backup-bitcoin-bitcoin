Not locking cs_main while validating assumeutxo snapshots, so the node is responsive when the background chainstate download finishes.\r\n2. Deleting the background chainstate right away when it is no longer needed, instead of waiting until the next restart, which takes up extra disk space and slows down the next startup.",

      "body": "Update on this PR: The state cleanup part of this PR is implemented. I think it is a nice change which should make code easier to understand by making chainstate objects self contained and removing assumeutxo specific special cases in validation code. It also net removes 140 lines of code.\r\n\r\nThe locking changes (not yet pushed) are a mess, though. As mentioned in the PR description, I'm trying to delete the background chainstate after snapshot validation without waiting for bitcoind to be restarted. This requires a mutex to protect chainstates from being deleted while they are in use, so I added a simple `m_chainstates_mutex` to guard the `m_chainstates` vector, but this has snowballed into a much bigger change because of lock ordering conflicts. Some parts of the code like `Chainstate::ActivateBestChain` need to lock `m_chainstates_mutex` before `cs_main` so `cs_main` can be released to let notifications be processed. But most code wants to lock `cs_main` first, and only needs to access `ChainstateManager` object briefly to get a reference to the active chain, so it more naturally locks `cs_main` before `m_chainstates_mutex`. I was able to make cleanups in validation.cpp, moving things between `Chainstate` and `ChainstateManager` to acquire `m_chainstates_mutex` before `cs_main`, or relying on `Chainstate` members and avoiding the need to lock `m_chainstates_mutex` at all, and I think these changes are good, but after doing this (3b5c646790c55c01c318bce7d029a8d9e67147bc) it turns out the lock order inconsistency is much worse in net_processing than validation, and it would not be good for performance or code complexity to try lock `m_chainstates_mutex` before `cs_main` there.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of taking a different approach of using a shared mutex instead of an exclusive mutex to protect access to `Chainstate` instances and prevent them from being deleted while in use. Then code could freely obtain shared locks to `m_chainstates_mutex` and exclusive locks to `cs_main` in either order. In order to prevent deadlocks, the small amount of code that creates and deletes chainstates and needs exclusive access to both locks would just need to be careful to acquire both locks atomically and never hold one exclusive lock while it is waiting for the other. This idea is conceptually pretty simple, and it could introduce support for shared locking that could be useful in other contexts. But I'm not exactly sure what approach to take with the implementation, and I'm worried it may run into problems with compiler thread safety analysis. I'm also wondering if it might make sense to pause working on locking and instead work on splitting up the current PR into commits to make it more reviewable.",

This block would not be\nmarked assumed-valid because it would not be an ancestor of the snapshot, and\nit would have nTx set, nChainTx unset, and prev->nChainTx set with a fake\nvalue, so the assert would fail. After this commit, prev->nChainTx is unset\ninstead of being set to a fake value, so the assert succeeds. A test which\nsubmits a block like this and previously crashed the node has been added in\nfeature_assumeutxo.py. It was written and posted by maflcko in\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29261#issuecomment-1918947945\n\nCompatibility note: This change could result in -checkblockindex failures if a\nsnapshot was loaded by a previous version of Bitcoin Core and not fully\nvalidated, because fake nTx values will have been saved to the block index. It\nwould be pretty easy to avoid these failures by adding some compatibility code\nto `LoadBlockIndex` and changing `nTx` values from 1 to 0 when they are fake\n(when `(pindex->nStatus & BLOCK_VALID_MASK) < BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS`), but a\nlittle simpler not to worry about being compatible in this case.\n\nCo-authored-by: MarcoFalke <*~=`'#}+{/-|&$^_@721217.xyz>",

Should I work on this or open a separate pr, either way works for me?\r\n\r\nHi, feel free to work on anything here and open a separate PR. Note that this PR is trying to do two things:\r\n\r\n1. Refactor assumeutxo implementation so it is more self-contained and assumeutxo terms and special cases are not all over validation and networking code. I wound up opening a separate PR #30214 to do this, which is still not merged but work is ongoing.\r\n\r\n2. Improving assumeutxo implementation. Specifically when background chainstate finishes downloading, not keeping cs_main locked while validating the snapshot, and deleting the background chainstate right away instead of waiting until the next restart.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which of these you may be more interested in but progress has been very slow on the first and nonexistent on the second. I think different approaches are possible and the two things above are not tied together so a lot could be done here depending on your goals.",
