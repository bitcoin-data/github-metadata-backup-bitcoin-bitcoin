    "body": "Removes the leading 0 from the version number. The minor version, which we had been using as the major version, is now the major version. The revision, which we had been using as the minor version, is now the minor version. The revision number is dropped. The build number is promoted to being part of the version number. This also avoids issues where it was accidentally not included in the version number.\r\n\r\nThe CLIENT_VERSION remains the same format as previous as previously, as the Major version was 0 so it never actually got included in it.\r\n\r\nThe user agent string formatter is updated to follow this new versioning.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHonestly I'm just tired of all of the people asking for \"1.0\" that maybe this'll shut them up. Skip the whole 1.0 thing and go straight to version 22.0!\r\n\r\nAlso, this means that the terminology we commonly use lines up with how the variables are named. So major versions are actually bumping the major version number, etc.",

      "body": "> Is there any strong fundamental long-term drawback on the calendar versioning, i.e. yy.mm.bugfixes (as suggested by JeremyRubin, luke-jr), other than \"dropping the zero is simpler\"? If not, I'd prefer the calendar versioning as well, it's just nice that you can immediately deduce when a client/node has been last updated by looking at the version, w/o having to look up the version history.\r\n\r\nI think the main drawback is user confusion. Changing the version number to a new scheme will cause confusion in the short term, but in the long term, when referring to older releases, there may also be confusion there. I think that with this change, there will be less confusion. It's easier to explain that the versioning is the same but just without the leading zero, than it is to explain that, e.g. 20.11 is the major release and there are no versions 20.0 - 20.10.\r\n\r\nIn terms of code changes, both switching to calendar versioning and this change are probably the same amount of changes in roughly the same places. It's just that conceptually it's easier to understand \"drop the unused zero\" than it is to understand switching to something entirely new.",

          "body": "This is an implementation of [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518), using primitives in the BIP-330 (see the updated spec [here](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki)). Please refer to these two to understand the design. My talk on the topic is [here](https://youtu.be/YxsjdIl0034?t=670).\r\n\r\nErlay uses both flooding (announcing using INV messages to all peers) and reconciliation to announce transactions. Flooding is expensive, so Erlay seeks to use it sparingly and in strategic locations - only well-connected publicly reachable nodes flood transactions to other publicly reachable nodes via outbound connections. Since every unreachable node is directly connected to several reachable nodes, this policy ensures that a transaction is quickly propagated to be within one hop from most of the nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nAll transactions not propagated through flooding are propagated through efficient set reconciliation. To do this, every node keeps a reconciliation set for each peer, in which transactions are placed which would have been announced using INV messages absent this protocol. Every 2 seconds every node chooses a peer from its outbound connections in a predetermined order to reconcile with, resulting in both sides learning the transactions known to the other side. After every reconciliation round, the corresponding reconciliation set is cleared.\r\n\r\nI think both paper and the BIP motives the changes, but I'll mention them briefly once again here:\r\n- save 40% of the bandwidth consumed by a node\r\n- increase network connectivity for almost no bandwidth or latency cost\r\n- improves privacy as a side-effect\r\n\r\nObviously looking for review, let's try to start with a high-level concerns, and keep nits for later.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nPlease don't be scared of 8,000 LOC added. 7,000 of them is minisketch added as a subtree.\r\n\r\nP.P.S.\r\nMy experiments of running this code live (slightly outdated) with a script to replicate the experiment: [here1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-599241490) and [here2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18261#issuecomment-600388543).\r\n",

Like for previous major releases I've aimed for a release 6 months after the last (#18947).\r\n\r\nIt is based on the projected release date for 0.21.0, so it is possible these move forward if there is slippage.\r\n\r\nThere was a rename from `0.22.0` to `22.0`; see #20223.\r\n\r\n2021-06-01  :heavy_check_mark: \r\n---------------\r\n- Open Transifex translations for 22\r\n- Soft translation string freeze (no large or unnecessary string changes until release)\r\n- Finalize and close translations for 0.20\r\n\r\n2021-06-15 :heavy_check_mark: \r\n---------------\r\n- Feature freeze (bug fixes only until release)\r\n- Translation string freeze (no more source language changes until release)\r\n\r\n2021-07-01  :heavy_check_mark: \r\n---------------\r\n- Split off `22` branch from `master`\r\n- Start RC cycle, tag and release `22.0rc1`\r\n- Start merging for 23 on `master` branch\r\n\r\n2021-09-13  :heavy_check_mark: \r\n---------------\r\n- Release 22.0 final\r\n\r\nIf any specific dates or timeframes are a problem for you, let me know.",
