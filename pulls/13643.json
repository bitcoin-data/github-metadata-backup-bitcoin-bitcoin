    "body": "Early version of NSIS searches its DLL from the same directory of the executable. If a hacker can place some DLL files in the same directory of the bitcoin installer, the installer will load and run it with admin permission.\r\n\r\nGitian is still in trusty. It shipped with NSIS 2.46, which is vulnerable to this issue. So in this fix, we instead build the latest NSIS by Gitian.\r\n\r\nThanks to @wilsonmeier from Bitcoin Gold team for the fix. Borrowed some code from TOR project.\r\n\r\nDetails: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/17895",
