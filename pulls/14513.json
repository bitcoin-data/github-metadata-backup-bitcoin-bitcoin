(Just to be clear: obviously _this_ specific case cannot be detected by dynamic analysis.)\r\n\r\nI was talking about dynamic analysis here since I believe the sanitizers would likely give us the most bang for the buck (especially ASAN and UBSAN) in terms of both precision and recall (for catching memory corruption bugs such as use-after-free:s, UB:s in general, etc.). So that's a good start.\r\n\r\nBut as you know I have a lot of love also for static analysis (various forms of linters, etc.) :-)  Dynamic or static – I love 'em all! ",
