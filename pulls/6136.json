    "body": "I'm pushing this up before bed in case the breakage gets worse as Europe wakes up and starts PR'ing. I'd prefer to check the build log of this PR itself before merge, but I think all should be OK as-is.\n\nIn some cases (Travis), sources and build caches may be moved around in-between builds, and we can't necessarily trust that everything is still intact. In particular, this should properly detect and recover from Travis corruption that came up this week.\n\nThis introduces pre-build checks that verify against stashed checksums.\n\nNote that this will cause all sources to be re-downloaded, since (moved) cached sources weren't completely trustworthy before this.\n",
