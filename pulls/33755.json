    "body": "In PR #5247, the STRICTENC standardness rules were tightned with regards to CHECKMULTISIG so that unparsable public keys fail the script when they are encountered. The overall purpose here was to disallow the use of confusing hybrid public keys by policy while remaining keeping policy compatible (i.e. strictly stronger) than consensus rules.\r\n\r\nComments in PR #5247 note that \"I don't believe it should affect any system in production\", however this believe is/was false. Counterparty was stuffing data blobs into multisig pubkey lists.  But these UTXOs were meant to be spendable because, although some pubkeys were unparsable, other keys were parsable, and the UTXOs were meant to be spent by those valid keys.\r\n\r\nBut in tackling the hybrid key issue, PR #5247 disallowed any unparsable keys in multisigs, whether or not they were hybrid, and whether or not the signature was meant to satify a hybrid key.\r\n\r\nIn production Counterparty UTXOs were inadvertantly caught up in this standardness rule change and became \"soft confiscated\", that is not longer spendable by policy but still recoverable if users are able to somehow bypass standardness by mining their transactions themselves, or getting out-of-band assistance from some other miner.\r\n\r\nI understand that Bitcoin Core never intended to \"soft confiscate\" any UTXOs by policy changes.  This change addresses the problem.\r\n\r\nWith this change standardness rules intended for hybrid keys are only checked after passing a signature check in CHECKMULTISIG operations.  Failing signature checks revert to their consensus behaviour of testing subsequent public keys.\r\n\r\nCounterparty UTXOs were never intended to make use of hybrid keys, and thus shouldn't have any passing signatures using hybrid keys.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

      "message": "Relax standardness rules regarding CHECKMULTISIG\n\nIn PR #5247, the STRICTENC standardness rules were tightned with regards to\nCHECKMULTISIG so that unparsable public keys fail the script when they are\nencountered. The overall purpose here was to disallow the use of confusing\nhybrid public keys by policy while remaining keeping policy compatible (i.e.\nstrictly stronger) than consensus rules.\n\nComments in PR #5247 note that \"I don't believe it should affect any system in\nproduction\", however this believe is/was false. Counterparty was stuffing data\nblobs into multisig pubkey lists.  But these UTXOs were meant to be spendable\nbecause, although some pubkeys were unparsable, other keys were parsable, and the\nUTXOs were meant to be spent by those valid keys.\n\nBut in tackling the hybrid key issue, PR #5247 disallowed any unparsable keys in\nmultisigs, whether or not they were hybrid, and whether or not the signature\nwas meant to satify a hybrid key.\n\nIn production Counterparty UTXOs were inadvertantly caught up in this\nstandardness rule change and became \"soft confiscated\", that is not longer\nspendable by policy but still recoverable if users are able to somehow bypass\nstandardness by mining their transactions themselves, or getting out-of-band\nassistance from some other miner.\n\nI understand that Bitcoin Core never intended to \"soft confiscate\" any UTXOs by\npolicy changes.  This change addresses the problem.\n\nWith this change standardness rules intended for hybrid keys are only checked\nafter passing a signature check in CHECKMULTISIG operations.  Failing signature\nchecks revert to their consensus behaviour of testing subsequent public keys.\n\nCounterparty UTXOs were never intended to make use of hybrid keys, and thus\nshouldn't have any passing signatures using hybrid keys.",
