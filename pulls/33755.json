    "body": "In PR #5247, the STRICTENC standardness rules were tightened with regards to CHECKMULTISIG so that unparsable public keys fail the script when they are encountered. The overall purpose here was to disallow the use of confusing hybrid public keys by policy while keeping policy compatible (i.e., strictly stronger) with consensus rules.\r\n\r\nComments in PR #5247 note that \"I don't believe it should affect any system in production\"; however, this belief is/was false. Counterparty was stuffing data blobs into multisig pubkey lists, but these UTXOs were meant to be spendable because, although some pubkeys were unparsable, other keys were parsable, and the UTXOs were meant to be spent by those valid keys.\r\n\r\nBut in tackling the hybrid key issue, PR #5247 disallowed any unparsable keys in multisigs, whether or not they were hybrid, and whether or not the signature was meant to satisfy a hybrid key.\r\n\r\nIn production, Counterparty UTXOs were inadvertently caught up in this standardness rule change and became \"soft confiscated.\"  That is, they were no longer spendable by policy but still recoverable if users are able to somehow bypass standardness by mining their transactions themselves, or getting out-of-band assistance from some other miner.\r\n\r\nI understand that Bitcoin Core never intended to \"soft confiscate\" any UTXOs by policy changes.  This change addresses the problem.\r\n\r\nWith this change, standardness rules intended for hybrid keys are only checked after passing a signature check in CHECKMULTISIG operations.  Failing signature checks revert to their consensus behaviour of testing subsequent public keys.\r\n\r\nCounterparty UTXOs were never intended to make use of hybrid keys and thus shouldn't have any passing signatures using hybrid keys.\r\n",

      "message": "Relax standardness rules regarding CHECKMULTISIG\n\nIn PR #5247, the STRICTENC standardness rules were tightened with regards to\nCHECKMULTISIG so that unparsable public keys fail the script when they are\nencountered. The overall purpose here was to disallow the use of confusing\nhybrid public keys by policy while keeping policy compatible (i.e., strictly\nstronger) with consensus rules.\n\nComments in PR #5247 note that \"I don't believe it should affect any system in\nproduction\"; however, this belief is/was false. Counterparty was stuffing data\nblobs into multisig pubkey lists, but these UTXOs were meant to be spendable\nbecause, although some pubkeys were unparsable, other keys were parsable, and\nthe UTXOs were meant to be spent by those valid keys.\n\nBut in tackling the hybrid key issue, PR #5247 disallowed any unparsable keys in\nmultisigs, whether or not they were hybrid, and whether or not the signature was\nmeant to satisfy a hybrid key.\n\nIn production, Counterparty UTXOs were inadvertently caught up in this\nstandardness rule change and became \"soft confiscated.\" That is, they were no\nlonger spendable by policy but still recoverable if users are able to somehow\nbypass standardness by mining their transactions themselves, or getting\nout-of-band assistance from some other miner.\n\nI understand that Bitcoin Core never intended to \"soft confiscate\" any UTXOs by\npolicy changes. This change addresses the problem.\n\nWith this change, standardness rules intended for hybrid keys are only checked\nafter passing a signature check in CHECKMULTISIG operations. Failing signature\nchecks revert to their consensus behaviour of testing subsequent public keys.\n\nCounterparty UTXOs were never intended to make use of hybrid keys and thus\nshouldn't have any passing signatures using hybrid keys.",

      "body": "@ajtowns I did consider that.\r\n\r\nFirstly we should note that `SCRIPT_VERIFY_WITNESS_PUBKEYTYPE` and BIP-143 rules regarding compressed public keys are not consensus rules, but policy only.  So at least it *can* be weakened.\r\n\r\nRegarding as to whether it should be weakened: Currently Bitcoin Core's implementation choice for CHECKMULTISIG is such that once enough signatures match the pubkeys, no further pubkeys in the CHECKMULTISIG stack are inspected for well-formedness policy constraints.  That is to say, current policy lets you have uncompressed pubkeys (or at least data that looks like uncompressed pubkeys) on one side of the stack of pubkeys but not the other.  This change in policy makes it (more) symmetric so that you can have uncompressed pubkeys (or data that looks like uncompressed pubkeys) on either end of the stack of pubkeys, but those uncompressed pubkeys cannot be used in passing signature checks.\r\n\r\nNow the Counterparty UTXO predates Segwit V0, so we could refactor the code to keep the current asymmetric policy rules regarding Segwit V0 script, and I would be fine with that.  However, my current judgement is that, since data-that-looks-like-uncompressed-pubkeys is already allowed on one side of the pubkey stack in Segwit V0 script, it isn't worth the code complexity to maintain this policy for the sake of Segwit V0 script.  There is no real advantage in doing that extra work.  If other folks do think it is worthwhile for reasons I cannot imagine, I'm fine with that too.",

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong and Counterparty was using p2sh multisigs.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked my IRC logs, but my recollection is the person I was chatting with who had their UTXO's soft-confiscated by Bitcoin Core's policy change decided the amount of funds were small and they were not going to pursue it.  However what was a small amount of Bitcoin 11 years ago may not be a small amount today.\r\n\r\nAgain, this soft-confiscation was inadvertent.  PR #5247 was trying to address hybrid keys, not Counterparty UTXOs.  An error was made and the result was arguably unjust towards those folks holding those UTXOs.\r\n\r\nRecent posts on the mailing list made me aware that people incorrectly believe that Bitcoin Core has never soft-confiscated folk's UTXOs before, but I know that isn't true.  I'm not sure what my thinking was at the time, but had I thought there it was a deliberate policy decision against Counterparty transactions. However, upon rereviewing PR #5247 last night I came to understand the policy was never intended to soft-confiscate Counterparty UTXOs.  And this morning I realized we can fix this injustice.  Better late than never.\r\n\r\nSoft-confiscating these transactions was wrong, and we should fix mistakes if we can when we realize we have made one, even if the mistake was made 11 years ago.  This code is the way PR #5247 ought to have been written in the first place.",

Template building by hashers also make that more accessible today than previously.
