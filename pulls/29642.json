    "body": "Based on #25665.\r\n\r\nCurrently functions issuing fatal errors call the `fatalError` notification method to issue a shutdown procedure. This makes it hard for higher level functions to figure out if an error deeper in the call stack occurred. For users of the kernel it might also be difficult to assert which function call issued a fatal error if they are being run concurrently. If the kernel would eventually be used by external users, getting fatal error information through a callback instead of function return values would also be cumbersome and limiting. Unit, bench, and fuzz tests currently don't have a way to effectively test against fatal errors.\r\n\r\nThis patch set is an attempt to make fatal error handling in the kernel code more transparent. Fatal errors are now passed up the call stack through `util::Result<T, FatalError>` failure values. A previous attempt at this by theuni always immediately returned failure values if a function call returned a failure. However, this is not always desirable (see discussion [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27866#discussion_r1256378064)). Sometimes, further operations can still be completed even if a fatal error was issued. The solution to this is that these \"ignored\" errors are still moved through `util::Result`'s error string values with its `.MoveMessages` method, even while a failure value in the result is not present.\r\n\r\nNext to some smaller behavior changes, the most significant change is that the issuing of a shutdown procedure is delayed until a potential fatal error is handled as opposed to immediately when it is first encountered. Another effect is that potential fatal errors are now asserted in the bench, fuzz and unit tests. Some of the currently not immediately returned fatal errors need some further scrutiny. These are marked with a `TODO (fatal error)` comment and could be tackled in a later PR.\r\n\r\nTo validate this approach a new clang-tidy check is introduced. It implements the following checks:\r\n\r\n1. If a function calls another function with a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` return type, its return type has to be `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` too, or it has to handle the value returned by the function with one of `CheckFatal`, `HandleFatalError`,\r\n`UnwrapFatalError`, or `CheckFatalFailure`.\r\n2. In functions returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` a call to a function returning a `util::Result<T, FatalCondition>` needs to propagate the value by either:\r\n   - Returning it immediately\r\n   - Assigning it immediately to an existing result with `.MoveMessages()` or `.Set()`\r\n   - Eventually passing it as an argument to a `.MoveMessages()`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587) and is a step towards stage 2, creating a more refined kernel API.",

I first wrote the error handling and then the tidy plugin. The plugin helped uncover a handful of bugs that were not immediately obvious to me, so I do think it is useful beyond `[[nodiscard]]`. It also uncovered some cases where the current handling of the fatal errors is questionable. I don't think the helper functions are all that complicated, though their naming sure could be improved to make it more obvious what they do. They also only form a small part of what the linter enforces. If reviewers view the linter as too specialized, it could be dropped from the PR, but still used to validate the work.\r\n\r\n> The benefit of adding all the [FatalError](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/blob/f251761036231fe0c6f92d5af75f6507a17408a4/src/kernel/fatal_error.h#L12-L35)/[HandleFatalError](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/blob/f251761036231fe0c6f92d5af75f6507a17408a4/src/node/abort.h#L24-L32)/[CheckFatal](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/blob/f251761036231fe0c6f92d5af75f6507a17408a4/src/node/abort.h#L34-L46)/[clang-tidy](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/blob/f251761036231fe0c6f92d5af75f6507a17408a4/contrib/devtools/bitcoin-tidy/fatal_error.cpp) stuff is that it can replace the [fatalError and flushError](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3d216baf91ca754e46e89788205513a956ec6d0a/src/kernel/notifications_interface.h#L45-L60) notifications\r\n\r\nTo me this is more the logical conclusion of the PR than its goal. The goal is to bubble up an error code. Adding an error code next to the existing fatalError and flushError notifications in validation that is not used by production code for the sake of not changing things too much seems unfortunate though. The PR already tries hard to keep the rest of the behavior when a fatal error is encountered the same. Having three different fatal mechanisms seems more confusing than one consistent one that is enforced with a linter and is very mechanical. I also feel like having multiple ways to achieve the same outcome is bad API design. Removing the notifications could be done at a later point, but I don't think it makes this PR significantly harder to review and it would leave things in an inconclusive state.\r\n\r\n> It also seems like it would be nice to have local enums for functions like ProcessTransaction and ActivateBestChain that just have 2 or 3 error codes instead of 22 error codes like FatalError.\r\n\r\nThe code has always treated fatal errors as their own weird separate thing, so putting them in a a single enum does not really feel that unnatural to me. However this PR could also be realized with more specialized types. What benefit do you see with such an approach?",

      "body": "Thanks for explanations. So as I understand it, this PR is trying to do 3 things:\r\n\r\n(1) Ensure that if an error happens while calling a function, the error is returned to the caller.\r\n(2) Ensure if that if an error happens while calling a function, and the node will be shutting down as a result of that error, the fact node is shutting down will be returned to the caller.\r\n(3) Fix a \"handful of bugs\" in error handling.\r\n\r\nI think (1) is great and definitely worth doing, but I don't think this PR is doing an ideal job in its implementation. I can describe the specific problems I see there currently below.\r\n\r\nI don't really think (2) is a worthwhile goal, because it should have no effect on libbitcoinkernel users and I don't really see how it could catch any significant internal bugs. But if there is a way to implement it without negatively impacting libbitcoinkernel API, I think it would be fine to pursue.\r\n\r\nI'm extremely wary of (3). I fully believe there are bugs in error handling and many things that could be improved, but I don't think those changes can be effectively reviewed as part of a big refactoring PR like this. I think it can be ok to combine behavior changes with refactoring when the combining these simplifies things, but in this case I only see adding return information at the same time as changing error handling making things more complicated. (If there are counterexamples, though, I could be convinced otherwise.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe specific problems I see with error reporting in this PR have to do with the `FatalError` enum. I think it is a bad developer experience to have a bunch of functions returning an enum with 20 possible error values, and not knowing which functions might return which values, and not having a suggestion of how different values need to be handled. I'm also skeptical that \"fatal errors\" are a concept that should be exposed to libbitcoinkernel callers, since not all callers will be implementing nodes that need to shut down, and normally library functions should be able to report errors without requiring they be handled in a certain way. Also, I think the fact that error type is an enum type rather than something more general like a std::variant means that it might be hard to return add useful metadata to the result value (like which block could not be read if a block read failed).\r\n\r\nI was experimenting today with a change to just return \\[\\[nodiscard]] util::Result from every function calling fatalError or flushError, and I think is mostly complete (validation.cpp and blockstorage.cpp compile) which I think could be a simpler approach, providing a better API for libbitcoinkernel callers, and also being easier to review. I think other improvements could be made on top of it but maybe it is a simpler starting point. Commit is bc1055157b2e6458683953a41a7b243f27f77d98 and I can work on getting the rest of it compiling and then splitting it up.",

The bugs I was referring to before were all in how I was introducing the bubbling up of the errors and not with when or how an error is being issued currently. To reiterate, this patch set does not change when errors are being issued, nor should it influence the control flow. I'm not fixing bugs in error handling here.\r\n\r\n> I'm also skeptical that \"fatal errors\" are a concept that should be exposed to libbitcoinkernel callers, since not all callers will be implementing nodes that need to shut down, and normally library functions should be able to report errors without requiring they be handled in a certain way.\r\n\r\nThat is a fair point.

The reason I was using `util::Result` was that it provides a single, predictable way to handle the errors. An approach with a variant or tuple type would be able to return richer information, but also be less predictable.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n> I'm also skeptical that \"fatal errors\" are a concept that should be exposed to libbitcoinkernel callers, since not all callers will be implementing nodes that need to shut down.\r\n\r\nThinking about this some more, I'm still not convinced that putting them in a separate class of their own is bad. Core is and will be the primary user of the kernel, so consideration for how outside users might interpret the errors does not seem that important to me. I get that it might be nice to see when calling a function which fatal errors exactly it might issue, but for functions like `ImportBlocks` this is going to be a big subset of them. We also don't really have similar mechanisms in place for existing error handling in the code., e.g. we often just return a plain error string, which I'm doing here too. ",
