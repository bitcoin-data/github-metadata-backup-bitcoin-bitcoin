    "body": "## Problem description\r\n\r\nThere is demand from users to get the UTXO set in form of a SQLite database (#24628). Bitcoin Core currently only supports dumping the UTXO set in a binary _compact-serialized_ format, which was crafted specifically for AssumeUTXO snapshots (see PR #16899), with the primary goal of being as compact as possible. Previous PRs tried to extend the `dumptxoutset` RPC with new formats, either in human-readable form (e.g. #18689, #24202), or most recently, directly as SQLite database (#24952). Both are not optimal: due to the huge size of the ever-growing UTXO set with already more than 80 million entries on mainnet, human-readable formats are practically useless, and very likely one of the first steps would be to put them in some form of database anyway. Directly adding SQLite3 dumping support on the other hand introduces an additional dependency to the non-wallet part of bitcoind and the risk of increased maintenance burden (see e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1163551060, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24628#issuecomment-1108469715).\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis PR follows the \"external tooling\" route by adding a simple Python script for achieving the same goal in a two-step process (first create compact-serialized UTXO set via `dumptxoutset`, then convert it to SQLite via the new script). Executive summary:\r\n- single file, no extra dependencies (sqlite3 is included in Python's standard library [1])\r\n- ~150 LOC, mostly deserialization/decompression routines ported from the Core codebase and (probably the most difficult part) a little elliptic curve / finite field math to decompress pubkeys (essentialy solving the secp256k1 curve equation y^2 = x^3 + 7 for y given x, respecting the proper polarity as indicated by the compression tag)\r\n- creates a database with only one table `utxos` with the following schema:\r\n  ```(txid TEXT, vout INT, value INT, coinbase INT, height INT, scriptpubkey TEXT)```\r\n- the resulting file has roughly 2x the size of the compact-serialized UTXO set (this is mostly due to encoding txids and scriptpubkeys as hex-strings rather than bytes)\r\n\r\n[1] note that there are some rare cases of operating systems like FreeBSD though, where the sqlite3 module has to installed explicitly (see #26819)\r\n\r\nA functional test is also added that creates UTXO set entries with various output script types (standard and also non-standard, for e.g. large scripts) and verifies that the UTXO sets of both formats match by comparing corresponding MuHashes. One MuHash is supplied by the bitcoind instance via `gettxoutsetinfo muhash`, the other is calculated in the test by reading back the created SQLite database entries and hashing them with the test framework's `MuHash3072` module.\r\n\r\n## Manual test instructions\r\nI'd suggest to do manual tests also by comparing MuHashes. For that, I've written a go tool some time ago which would calculate the MuHash of a sqlite database in the created format (I've tried to do a similar tool in Python, but it's painfully slow).\r\n```\r\n$ [run bitcoind instance with -coinstatsindex]\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli dumptxoutset ~/utxos.dat\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo muhash <block height returned in previous call>\r\n(outputs MuHash calculated from node)\r\n\r\n$ ./contrib/utxo-tools/utxo_to_sqlite.py ~/utxos.dat ~/utxos.sqlite\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/theStack/utxo_dump_tools\r\n$ cd utxo_dump_tools/calc_utxo_hash\r\n$ go run calc_utxo_hash.go ~/utxos.sqlite\r\n(outputs MuHash calculated from the SQLite UTXO set)\r\n\r\n=> verify that both MuHashes are equal\r\n```\r\nFor a demonstration what can be done with the resulting database, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#pullrequestreview-956290477 for some example queries. Thanks go to LarryRuane who gave me to the idea of rewriting this script in Python and adding it to `contrib`.",

          "body": "**Note: this PR has been superseded by #28948 (v3) and #28984 (package RBF)**\r\n\r\nSee #27463 for overall package relay tracking.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains 2 projects: v3 policy and package RBF. Mailing list posts: [package RBF 1](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019464.html) and [V3 + package RBF 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020937.html). It stems from a long discussion about RBF pinning, across a [mailing list thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-January/019817.html) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff).\r\n\r\nV3 Policy: A set of policy rules applied to transactions with their `nVersion` field set to 3. Namely, it allows users to opt in to more restrictive descendant limits for shared transactions. If adopted by many nodes in the network, V3 mitigates various RBF pinning attacks. See doc/policy/version3_transactions.md for the exact rules and rationale, and [these review club notes](bitcoincore.reviews/25038) for more background and discussion.\r\n\r\nPackage RBF: In addition to allowing a child to pay for its parents within the package, also allow the child to pay for replacing the parent's conflicts. For example, this allows LN users to replace commitment transactions existing in the mempool, simply by broadcasting their respective commitment transactions with a high-fee child. The commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees, which means no overpaying.\r\n\r\nFAQ: is v3 still helpful even with cluster mempool (#27677) ?\r\n\r\n- Rule 3 pinning: This is addressed with v3 but not really with cluster mempool (descendant allowance is still too permissive).\r\n- Package RBF and ACP pinning: This PR allows for package RBF with v3 packages. V3 has an effective \"cluster limit\" of 2 which makes it very cheap to calculate the mining score of a v3 transaction. With cluster mempool, which also makes it easier to calculate mining score, we could have package RBF for non-v3 transactions.\r\n- Allowing 0fee transactions: This PR allows v3 transactions to be below minimum relay feerate, provided they are CPFP'd. This is because the simplified topology allows us to avoid situations like the ones described in #26933. With cluster mempool, we can allow this for non-v3 transactions.",

SQLite can store byte values as BLOBs.\r\n\r\nFair question. There was already some discussion in #24952 about whether to store txids/scriptPubKeys as TEXT or BLOB, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#pullrequestreview-952102140, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1108758629 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1108794823. The two main points were:\r\n\r\n- conversion from this database to json/csv etc should be as simple as possible, and ideally \"select * from utxos\" should already lead to human-readable output. Converting would then be as trivial as a short one-liner `sqlite3 -json utxo.db \"SELECT * FROM utxos\" > utxo.json`, without even having to specify the columns\r\n- more annoying: if using BLOB for the txid, we would have to decide if we store the txid in little or big endian byte order. Big endian would be more natural, as that's how we internally store the txid and also serialize it on the wire, but we _show_ everything in little endian byte order in Bitcoin Core, so a simple \"select hex(txid) from utxos\" would just show the txid in the wrong order, and something like \"reverse(...)\" doesn't exist in SQLite (though some hacky workarounds have been proposed: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1164733346 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1165804095). There remains the possibility to just store the txid in little endian order, but that's the opposite of what we do in leveldb or in the serialization of outpoints, so it could lead to huge confusion for users if not clearly documented. For TEXT the order is clear, it's just stored what is shown everywhere in Bitcoin Core and all wallets, block explorers etc.\r\n\r\nConsidering the scriptPubKey column individually, there is no good reason to use TEXT rather than BLOB, but I went for TEXT mostly for consistency reasons, to not mix TEXT and BLOB in different columns when it's both binary data.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm also very open also for using BLOB instead, it's just a matter of trade-offs.",

Hex encoding seems a fine default to me, for what it's worth.\r\n\r\nIf people end up wanting lots of different options (convert scriptPubKeys to addresses? some way to update the db to a new state, rather than just create a new one?)  maybe it would make sense for this script to have its own repo even; but while it stays simple/small, seems fine for contrib.",

For those outputs, script compression is not possible, as the y coordinate of the pubkey can't be recovered (see also call-site of `IsToPubKey`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/compressor.cpp#L49-L50\r\n\r\nLikewise, for a compressed script of an uncompressed P2PK script (i.e. compression ids 4 and 5) where the x coordinate is not on the curve, decompression fails:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/44b05bf3fef2468783dcebf651654fdd30717e7e/src/compressor.cpp#L122-L129\r\n\r\nNote that the term \"compression\" is used here in two different meanings (though they are related), which might be a little confusing. The encoding of a pubkey can either be compressed (33-bytes with 0x02/0x03 prefixes) or uncompressed (65-bytes with 0x04 prefix). On the other hand there is also compression for whole output scripts, which is used for storing scriptPubKeys in the UTXO set in a compact way (and also for the `dumptxoutset` result, accordingly). P2PK output scripts with uncompressed pubkeys get compressed by storing only the x-coordinate and the sign as a prefix (0x04 = even, 0x05 = odd). Was diving deeper into the subject while working on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27432, where the script decompression of uncompressed P2PK needed special handling (see also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24628#issuecomment-1108798536).\r\n\r\nTrivia: as of now (block 801066), there are 13 uncompressed P2PK outputs in the UTXO set with a pubkey not on the curve (which obviously means they are unspendable).",

If larger, fail.\r\n3) The package rbf may not evict more than 100 transactions from the mempool(bip125 rule 5)\r\n4) The package is a single chunk\r\n5) Every directly conflicted mempool transaction is connected to at most 1 other in-mempool transaction (ie the cluster size of the conflict is at most 2).\r\n6) Diagram check: We ensure that the replacement is strictly superior, improving the mempool\r\n7) The total fee of the package, minus the total fee of what is being evicted, is at least the minrelayfee * size of the package (equivalent to bip125 rule 3 and 4)\r\n\r\nPost-cluster mempool this will likely be expanded to general package rbf, but this is what we can safely support today.\r\n",

Rebased on master and resolved the silent merge conflict (caused by the module move `test_framework.muhash` -> `test_framework.crypto.muhash` in #28374). Also fixed the Windows CI issue by closing the sqlite connections properly with explicit `con.close()` calls (see e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28204). CI is green now.\r\n\r\n>> What is the rationale for encoding as text rather than bytes? SQLite can store byte values as BLOBs.\r\n>\r\n> It's a python conversion script: can't you just add a command-line option for the resulting db to have hex txids or big/little endian blobs if there's user demand for it? Hex encoding seems a fine default to me, for what it's worth.\r\n\r\nGood idea, planning to tackle this as a follow-up.",

With this change, the same snapshot is 8.94 GB, a reduction of 17.4%.\r\n\r\nThis also enhances the metadata of the output file and adds the following data to allow for better error handling and make future upgrades easier:\r\n- A newly introduced utxo set magic\r\n- A version number\r\n- The network magic\r\n- The block height",

          "body": "`fclose(3)` may fail to flush the previously written data to disk, thus a failing `fclose(3)` is as serious as a failing `fwrite(3)`.\r\n\r\nPreviously the code ignored `fclose(3)` failures. This PR improves the explicit callers to check whether it failed. However there is a design issue that `fclose(3)` is also called from the `AutoFile` destructor. There is no good way to signal a failure to the caller from the destructor. So, if closing from the destructor fails, then log a message (the file name is unavailable at this time :disappointed:) and terminate the program.\r\n\r\nAlso check for `ferror(3)` after calls to `fread(3)`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther alternatives are:\r\n\r\n1. `fflush(3)` after each write to the file (and throw if it fails from the `AutoFile::write()` method) and hope that `fclose(3)` will then always succeed. Assert that it succeeds from the destructor :roll_eyes:. Will hurt performance.\r\n2. Throw nevertheless from the destructor. Exception within the exception in C++ I think results in terminating the program without a useful message.\r\n3. Redesign `AutoFile` so that its destructor cannot fail. Adjust _all_ its users :sob:. For example, if the file has been written to, then require the callers to explicitly call the `AutoFile::fclose()` method before the object goes out of scope. In the destructor, as a sanity check, assume/assert that this is indeed the case. Defeats the purpose of a RAII wrapper for `FILE*` which automatically closes the file when it goes out of scope and there are a lot of users of `AutoFile`.",

Transaction ID (txid) - 32 bytes\r\n2. Output Index (outnum)- 4 bytes\r\n3. VARINT (code) - A varible-length integer encoding the height and whether the transaction is a coinbase. The format of this VARINT is (height << 1) | coinbase_flag.\r\n4. VARINT (amount_v) - A variable-length integer that represents a compressed format of the output amount (in satoshis).\r\n\r\nFor the test cases mentioned:\r\n* **`b\"\\x84\\x58\"`** - This value corresponds to a VARINT representing the height and coinbase flag. Once we decode this code, we can extract the height and coinbase using `height = code_decoded >> 1` and `coinbase = code_decoded & 0x01`. In our case, with code_decoded = 728, it results in `height = 364` and `coinbase = 0`.\r\n* **`b\"\\xCA\\xD2\\x8F\\x5A\"`** - This byte sequence represents a compressed amount value. The decompression function takes this value and translates it into a full amount in satoshis. In our case, the decompression of this amount translates to a number larger than the maximum allowed value of coins (21 million BTC)\r\n",

However, I am happy to adapt this PR to a softfork change on testnet3 if there is consensus for that instead.\r\n- The difficulty adjustment fix suggested here touches the `CalculateNextWorkRequired` function and uses the same logic used in `GetNextWorkRequired` to find the last previous block that was not mined with difficulty 1 under the exceptionf. An alternative fix briefly mentioned on the mailing list by Jameson Lopp would be to \"restrict the special testnet minimum difficulty rule so that it can't be triggered on the block right before a difficulty retarget\". That would also fix the issue but I find my suggestion here a bit more elegant.",
