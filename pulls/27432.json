    "body": "## Problem description\r\n\r\nThere is demand from users to get the UTXO set in form of a SQLite database (#24628). Bitcoin Core currently only supports dumping the UTXO set in a binary _compact-serialized_ format, which was crafted specifically for AssumeUTXO snapshots (see PR #16899), with the primary goal of being as compact as possible. Previous PRs tried to extend the `dumptxoutset` RPC with new formats, either in human-readable form (e.g. #18689, #24202), or most recently, directly as SQLite database (#24952). Both are not optimal: due to the huge size of the ever-growing UTXO set with already more than 80 million entries on mainnet, human-readable formats are practically useless, and very likely one of the first steps would be to put them in some form of database anyway. Directly adding SQLite3 dumping support on the other hand introduces an additional dependency to the non-wallet part of bitcoind and the risk of increased maintenance burden (see e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1163551060, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24628#issuecomment-1108469715).\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis PR follows the \"external tooling\" route by adding a simple Python script for achieving the same goal in a two-step process (first create compact-serialized UTXO set via `dumptxoutset`, then convert it to SQLite via the new script). Executive summary:\r\n- single file, no extra dependencies (sqlite3 is included in Python's standard library [1])\r\n- ~150 LOC, mostly deserialization/decompression routines ported from the Core codebase and (probably the most difficult part) a little elliptic curve / finite field math to decompress pubkeys (essentialy solving the secp256k1 curve equation y^2 = x^3 + 7 for y given x, respecting the proper polarity as indicated by the compression tag)\r\n- creates a database with only one table `utxos` with the following schema:\r\n  ```(txid TEXT, vout INT, value INT, coinbase INT, height INT, scriptpubkey TEXT)```\r\n- the resulting file has roughly 2x the size of the compact-serialized UTXO set (this is mostly due to encoding txids and scriptpubkeys as hex-strings rather than bytes)\r\n\r\n[1] note that there are some rare cases of operating systems like FreeBSD though, where the sqlite3 module has to installed explicitly (see #26819)\r\n\r\nA functional test is also added that creates UTXO set entries with various output script types (standard and also non-standard, for e.g. large scripts) and verifies that the UTXO sets of both formats match by comparing corresponding MuHashes. One MuHash is supplied by the bitcoind instance via `gettxoutsetinfo muhash`, the other is calculated in the test by reading back the created SQLite database entries and hashing them with the test framework's `MuHash3072` module.\r\n\r\n## Manual test instructions\r\nI'd suggest to do manual tests also by comparing MuHashes. For that, I've written a go tool some time ago which would calculate the MuHash of a sqlite database in the created format (I've tried to do a similar tool in Python, but it's painfully slow).\r\n```\r\n$ [run bitcoind instance with -coinstatsindex]\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli dumptxoutset ~/utxos.dat\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo muhash <block height returned in previous call>\r\n(outputs MuHash calculated from node)\r\n\r\n$ ./contrib/utxo-tools/utxo_to_sqlite.py ~/utxos.dat ~/utxos.sqlite\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/theStack/utxo_dump_tools\r\n$ cd utxo_dump_tools/calc_utxo_hash\r\n$ go run calc_utxo_hash.go ~/utxos.sqlite\r\n(outputs MuHash calculated from the SQLite UTXO set)\r\n\r\n=> verify that both MuHashes are equal\r\n```\r\nFor a demonstration what can be done with the resulting database, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#pullrequestreview-956290477 for some example queries. Thanks go to LarryRuane who gave me to the idea of rewriting this script in Python and adding it to `contrib`.",

SQLite can store byte values as BLOBs.\r\n\r\nFair question. There was already some discussion in #24952 about whether to store txids/scriptPubKeys as TEXT or BLOB, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#pullrequestreview-952102140, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1108758629 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1108794823. The two main points were:\r\n\r\n- conversion from this database to json/csv etc should be as simple as possible, and ideally \"select * from utxos\" should already lead to human-readable output. Converting would then be as trivial as a short one-liner `sqlite3 -json utxo.db \"SELECT * FROM utxos\" > utxo.json`, without even having to specify the columns\r\n- more annoying: if using BLOB for the txid, we would have to decide if we store the txid in little or big endian byte order. Big endian would be more natural, as that's how we internally store the txid and also serialize it on the wire, but we _show_ everything in little endian byte order in Bitcoin Core, so a simple \"select hex(txid) from utxos\" would just show the txid in the wrong order, and something like \"reverse(...)\" doesn't exist in SQLite (though some hacky workarounds have been proposed: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1164733346 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24952#issuecomment-1165804095). There remains the possibility to just store the txid in little endian order, but that's the opposite of what we do in leveldb or in the serialization of outpoints, so it could lead to huge confusion for users if not clearly documented. For TEXT the order is clear, it's just stored what is shown everywhere in Bitcoin Core and all wallets, block explorers etc.\r\n\r\nConsidering the scriptPubKey column individually, there is no good reason to use TEXT rather than BLOB, but I went for TEXT mostly for consistency reasons, to not mix TEXT and BLOB in different columns when it's both binary data.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm also very open also for using BLOB instead, it's just a matter of trade-offs.",

      "body": "> Could mark as draft while CI is red?\r\n\r\nSorry for the extra-late reply, missed this message and the CI fail. Rebased on master and resolved the silent merge conflict (caused by the module move `test_framework.muhash` -> `test_framework.crypto.muhash` in #28374). Also fixed the Windows CI issue by closing the sqlite connections properly with explicit `con.close()` calls (see e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28204). CI is green now.\r\n\r\n>> What is the rationale for encoding as text rather than bytes? SQLite can store byte values as BLOBs.\r\n>\r\n> It's a python conversion script: can't you just add a command-line option for the resulting db to have hex txids or big/little endian blobs if there's user demand for it? Hex encoding seems a fine default to me, for what it's worth.\r\n\r\nGood idea, planning to tackle this as a follow-up.",
