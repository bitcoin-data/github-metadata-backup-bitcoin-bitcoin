See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

They're already not\nactually banned, as connections from them are still allowed,\nbut they are preferred for eviction if the inbound connection\nslots are full.\n\nStop treating these like manually banned IP ranges, and instead\njust keep them in a rolling Bloom filter of misbehaving nodes,\nwhich isn't persisted to disk or exposed through the ban\nframework. The effect remains the same: preferred for eviction,\navoided for outgoing connections, and not relayed to other peers.\n\nAlso change the name of this mechanism to better reflect reality;\nthey're not banned, just discouraged.\n\nContains release notes and several interface improvements by\nJohn Newbery.",

The effect remains the same: preferred for eviction,\navoided for outgoing connections, and not relayed to other peers.\n\nAlso change the name of this mechanism to better reflect reality;\nthey're not banned, just discouraged.\n\nContains release notes and several interface improvements by\nJohn Newbery.",

They're already not\nactually banned, as connections from them are still allowed,\nbut they are preferred for eviction if the inbound connection\nslots are full.\n\nStop treating these like manually banned IP ranges, and instead\njust keep them in a rolling Bloom filter of misbehaving nodes,\nwhich isn't persisted to disk or exposed through the ban\nframework. The effect remains the same: preferred for eviction,\navoided for outgoing connections, and not relayed to other peers.\n\nAlso change the name of this mechanism to better reflect reality;\nthey're not banned, just discouraged.\n\nContains release notes and several interface improvements by\nJohn Newbery.",
