    "body": "This PR introduces a number of configuration files which facilitate use of a Docker environment for local development and bitcoind execution. I've found this method to be an easy way to quickly setup a local dev environment; the use of a container also allows us to prevent polluting the host system with Bitcoin-specific dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe base image that I reference in the Dockerfile is maintained by Docker [in an \"official\" image repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/). It's based on Debian 8 \"Jessie\" and comes with Python 3.6.2 for running the tests.\r\n\r\nAfter obtaining the Docker dependencies (as described in `docs/build-docker.md`), building and testing bitcoin from scratch can be done in a single command:\r\n```\r\ndocker-compose run bitcoind test\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring the docker image build (`docker-compose build bitcoind`), system dependencies are installed per `docs/build-unix.md` (including all non-GUI optional dependencies) but Bitcoin itself isn't compiled. This is because `docker-compose` attaches the source tree to the container as a mounted volume after build, which allows changes we make to the source on the host machine to propagate immediately to a running container. The entrypoint script (`./bin/docker_entrypoint.sh`) is responsible for handling bitcoind compilation as well as providing the `test*` commands. Clang is installed and used as the default compiler.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that a few files (`Dockerfile`, `bin/`, `docker-compose.yaml`) are introduced to the top-level of the directory structure. I wasn't eager to do this -- I started out in `contrib/`, but in order for `docker-compose` to mount the entire source tree, commands have to be executed from the project root.\r\n\r\nThis is a modest suggestion and I'm happy to help incorporate feedback.",
