    "body": "## General\n\nThis PR softforks 3 lock-time related BIPs which are all implemented in `master` as mempool-only logic at the moment.\n1. [BIP68](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki) sequence locks for relative locktime;\n2. [BIP112](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-01128.mediawiki) CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY;\n3. [BIP113](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki) Media Time Past.\n### Dependencies\n\nWhy 3 BIPs at once?\n- BIP68 (sequence locks) independently enforces the same semantics BIP113 (MTP)\n- BIP112 (CSV) relies on BIP68\n### Relay policy for BIP113\n\nBIP113 mempool-only policy was deployed with Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 at the same time as the BIP65 CLTV softfork so the policy is in wide use (at  least 42% of nodes) as well as all the miners who upgraded to 0.11.2.\n### Relay policy for v2 transactions\n\nBIP68/112 rely on v2 transactions. Currently only v1 transactions are relayed, so it is necessary to change the relay policy to allow v2. This will be done at the same time as softfork deployment and will have the net effect that once the softfork enforces, we can be pretty sure miners will mine v2 transactions.\n\nAt a later date once enough nodes upgrade and we're sure v2 transaction will be relayed efficiently, we can bump the default transaction version in core see #7562.\n### Why ISM()?\n\nIt seems unlikely that BIP9 will be both developed and well tested enough to meet the roadmap schedule of deployment even with reasonable slippage taken into account. ISM is well oiled and tested.\n### Todos\n- [x] Change relay policy to allow tx.version=2\n- [x] fix bip68-sequence-p2p.py tests\n- [x] fix bip112-csv-p2p.py tests\n### Misc\n\nThis softfork _could_ also include SegWit BIP141.\n\nObviously, needs back-port to `0.12` at least.\n",

      "body": "a couple comments/questions about the rpc tests:\n- `blockversion5-ism.py` seems extraneous to me.  We already have prior versions of ism tests and in particular the p2p tests added here are testing the ISM logic for version 5 blocks already.\n- For BIP 68 we have the existing `bip68-sequence.py` which tests the logic of the code in a mempool only setting.  I think we need to decide whether that is sufficient when combined with a simple test that the activation logic is working in the bip68 test added here.  But for BIP 112 and 113 it seems we are still missing any tests that exercise the logic, other than the one simple case used to test activation in the rpc tests added here.\n- the RPC tests could have clearer names, for instance the existing bip68 rpc test is also a p2p test, so the distinction in the names is confusing, perhaps `bip68-sequence-activation.py`\n",

I think that means you need to change the 0 in https://github.com/btcdrak/bitcoin/blob/1fc83850c1308d6f72f357980f66dc9b30f3a4ed/src/main.cpp#L692 to match the result of ISM flags.  But I'm not sure I understand the reasoning for that or if it's necessary.\n\nThere does seem to be some missing logic around whether code here or in miner.cpp can actually somehow use STANDARD flags that accidentally don't incorporate consensus flags.  But that's not a new problem to this PR.\n",

It must necessarily use MTP as the start point, but the end point is either nTime or MTP based on activation of BIP 113.\n\nIn any case this is a call for @laanwj and @gmaxwell .\n\nEDIT: To be clear I've advocated in the past for more aggressive rollout of BIP 113 and the response I got was that it must be declared non-standard first and then wait for a period of time...\n",
