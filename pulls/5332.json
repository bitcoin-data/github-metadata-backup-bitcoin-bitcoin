Fixes #5235\n\nSome users may have libtool libs (.la) installed in their linker search paths.\nIn this case, using -static-libtool-libs would try to link in .a's instead of\nshared libs. That would be harmless unless the .a was built in a way that\nwould break linking, like non-fpic.\n\nWhat we really want is \"-static\" here. Despite its name, it's actually less\naggressive than -static-libtool-libs. It causes only internal libs to be linked\nstatically (libbitcoinconsensus is the one were'a after).",
