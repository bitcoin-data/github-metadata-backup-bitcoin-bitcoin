For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n* All changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`).  PR authors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n",

          "title": "Improve workflow for maintainers",
          "body": "This is maybe an overbroad issue, but it seems Bitcoin maintainers are currently struggling to keep track of open bitcoin PRs. From today's IRC meeting: \"I can't manually, humanly, handle 200+ PRs, sorry\" (https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/msg/104301215/).\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if it would be possible to add features to bitcoin-acks that could improve maintainer workflow. Two examples that come to mind:\r\n\r\n- Maybe bitcoinacks could detect a #needs-maintainer-attention or similar tag in comments, and detect maintainer responses. This way people could flag PRs that seem ready for merging or need other input, and maintainers could see the PRs that need actually need their attention, while giving other PRs less priority.\r\n\r\n- Maybe bitcoinacks could give maintainers a snooze feature, or a way of assigning their own labels or priorities to PRs. For example if @laanwj wants to only consider merging refactoring changes once a month, and not see a list of PRs filled with refactoring changes all the time, maybe bitcoinacks could provide his desired view.\r\n\r\nThese are just examples, and actual maintainers could probably come up with better suggestions, but it seems to me bitcoin-acks could be pretty useful as a tool for maintainers to keep with PRs, and it might be worth investigating if any new features could help.\r\n\r\nFirst question here for Pierre is just whether you think features targeted at maintainers would be acceptable or make sense as part of bitcoinacks.com. If so, then we could look into what features might be useful.",
