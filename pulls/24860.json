    "body": "The Miniscript repository and the Miniscript integration PR here have been a moving target for the past months, and some final cleanups were done there that were not included here. I initially intended to add some small followup commits to #24148 but i think there are enough of them to be worth a followup PR on its own.\r\n\r\nSome parts of the code did not change since it was initially written in 2019, and the code could use some modernization. (Use std::optional instead of out args, remove old compiler workarounds).\r\nWe refactored the helpers to be more meaningful, and also did some renaming. A new fuzz target was also added and both were merged in a single file. 2 more will be added in #24149 that will be contained in this file too.\r\n\r\nThe only behaviour change in this PR is to rule out Miniscript with duplicate keys from sane Miniscripts. In a P2WSH context, signatures can be rebounded (Miniscript does not use CODESEPARATOR) and it's reasonable to assume that reusing keys across the Script drops the malleability guarantees.\r\nIt was previously assumed such Miniscript would never exist in the first place since a compiler should never create them. We finally agreed that if one were to exist (say, written by hand or from a buggy compiler) it would be very confusing if an imported Miniscript descriptor (after #24148) with duplicate keys was deemed sane (ie, \"safe to use\") by Bitcoin Core. We now check for duplicate keys in the constructor.\r\n\r\nThis is (still) joint work with Pieter Wuille. (Actually he entirely authored the cleanups and code modernization.)",

          "title": "Miniscript integration",
          "body": " Miniscript is a language for writing (a subset of) Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way.\r\n\r\nMiniscript permits:\r\n- To safely extend the Output Descriptor language to many more scripting features thanks to the typing system (composition).\r\n- Static analysis of spending conditions, maximum spending cost of each branch, security properties, third-party malleability.\r\n- General satisfaction of any correctly typed (\"valid\" [0]) Miniscript. The satisfaction itself is also analyzable.\r\n- To extend the possibilities of external signers, because of all of the above and since it carries enough metadata.\r\n\r\nMiniscript guarantees:\r\n- That for any statically-analyzed as \"safe\" [0] Script, a witness can be constructed in the bounds of the consensus and standardness rules (standardness complete).\r\n- That unless the conditions of the Miniscript are met, no witness can be created for the Script (consensus sound).\r\n- Third-party malleability protection for the satisfaction of a sane Miniscript, which is too complex to summarize here.\r\n\r\nFor more details around Miniscript (including the specifications), please refer to the [website](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/).\r\n\r\nMiniscript was designed by Pieter Wuille, Andrew Poelstra and Sanket Kanjalkar.\r\nThis PR is an updated and rebased version of #16800. See [the commit history of the Miniscript repository](https://github.com/sipa/miniscript/commits/master) for details about the changes made since September 2019 (TL;DR: bugfixes, introduction of timelock conflicts in the type system, `pk()` and `pkh()` aliases, `thresh_m` renamed to `multi`, all recursive algorithms were made non-recursive).\r\n\r\nThis PR is also the first in a series of 3:\r\n- The first one (here) integrates the backbone of Miniscript.\r\n- The second one (#24148) introduces support for Miniscript in Output Descriptors, allowing for watch-only support of Miniscript Descriptors in the wallet.\r\n- The third one (#24149) implements signing for these Miniscript Descriptors, using Miniscript's satisfaction algorithm. \r\n\r\nNote to reviewers:\r\n- Miniscript is currently defined only for P2WSH. No Taproot yet.\r\n- Miniscript is different from the policy language (a high-level logical representation of a spending policy). A policy->Miniscript compiler is not included here.\r\n- The fuzz target included here is more interestingly extended in the 3rd PR to check a script's satisfaction against `VerifyScript`. I think it could be further improved by having custom mutators as we now have for multisig (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23105). A minified corpus of Miniscript Scripts is available at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/85.\r\n\r\n[0] We call \"valid\" any correctly-typed Miniscript. And \"safe\" any sane Miniscript, ie one whose satisfaction isn't malleable, which requires a key for any spending path, etc..",

I didn't look at the fuzz changes.\r\n\r\nDisallowing duplicate keys seems reasonable; I would not at all be surprised if people generate miniscript by hand or even from Sipa's website, and then paste whatever keys they need into the result. E.g. if you just need a timelock fallback, which you can't do with current descriptors, you probably won't go through the trouble of finding and installing a compiler, figuring out how to put xpub's into it, etc.\r\n\r\nNit: can you make b9a36d3c6ce77c98e5a6e76d0ed223c410f323d2 a scripted diff?",

          "body": "@ryanofsky recently suggested that I should write an overview of how the various pull requests spread over different repositories relate to some bigger picture view.\r\n\r\nSee the [multisig tutorial](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multisig-tutorial.md) for how things currently work.\r\n\r\nI typically have the following future multisig wallet in mind to guide my thinking:\r\n1. a computer running Bitcoin Core holding one master key (key 1)\r\n2. one or more hardware wallets with additional keys, via HWI (keys 2 ... n)\r\n3. taproot keypath using n-of-n MuSig2\r\n4. a fallback with fewer keys after some time elapsed\r\n5. a GUI wizard to set this up (simple Python command line tool until then)\r\n\r\nThe descriptors for this could be hand crafted, but it would be nice to have:\r\n6. Miniscript compiler that can generate this\r\n\r\n**What's Missing?**\r\n\r\n- Taproot support for external signers:\r\n  - [x] #22558 (PSBT fields)\r\n  - [x] #23578 (External signer support)\r\n- [x] Timelock support for descriptors: this will be added along with full [MiniScript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) support in #24148 & #24149 (@darosior).\r\n- [ ] Ability to handle descriptors for which we have 1-of-N keys. Descriptor wallets currently expect the wallet to be either watch-only and have no keys, or to have all the keys.\r\n  - [ ] #25907 makes it possible to create a wallet _with_ a seed, but without any descriptors.\r\n  - [ ] The user would grab an xpub from it (#22341 ) to construct a multisig descriptor and then import that.\r\n  - [ ] PR's to move in the right direction: #23417 and #23544 (very draft) \r\n- [ ] MuSig2 setup and signing support, which requires:\r\n  - [ ] a BIP to specify new PSBT fields\r\n  - [ ] Bitcoin Core changes; no PR yet afaik, see #23326\r\n  - [ ] At least one other (hardware) wallet to support it\r\n      * I'll try to add it to [nthKey](https://github.com/Sjors/nthkey-ios/issues/74) as soon as libwally supports it, see https://github.com/ElementsProject/libwally-core/issues/300)\r\n      * I'm not aware of any hardware wallet working on this yet\r\n      * testing with two Bitcoin Core nodes is good start\r\n  - [ ] HWI changes: additional commands for:\r\n     - [ ] initial setup\r\n     - [ ] signing (although perhaps calling `signtx` multiple times with the right PSBT will \"just work\")\r\n     * doesn't have to be HWI of course, we would just add support new commands in the [external signer command interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md) \r\n- [ ] a simple Python setup wizard\r\n   * right now [Specter Desktop](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop) is by far the easiest way to setup a multisig wallet. But it's a huge dependency (including a bunch of NPM packages for their web interface). A simple Python script in contrib/ could call HWI to get a list of signers, ask what threshold to use, call `createwallet` to generate a blank wallet, fetch an xpub from it, and then call `importdescriptors`.\r\n   * the script could use [BIP 129 / BSMS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0129.mediawiki) (perhaps initially without encryption)\r\n   * Specter doesn't set the external_signer wallet flag, so I have a trivial PR to do that manually: #21928 \r\n- [ ] a GUI setup wizard: once we have an established work flow, we would implement that in the GUI\r\n\r\n**Misc**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a PR that improves address display handling on the device: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24313\r\n\r\nEven better would be if we had a feature to ask the wallet for a signature to prove it has the private key (without passing that information to the outside world of course, see #24186). This requires BIP-322 support on our end (#24058), at least one hardware wallet to support it, and a new HWI `signmessage` command. Perhaps this can later be expanded to allow your device to prove that it (still) has the keys it needs as a co-signer.\r\n\r\nMiniscript compilers currently doesn't support Taproot (e.g. to find the optimal tree structure), but I'm assuming you can still hand craft a leaf containing MiniScript.

          "body": "As reported in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24860#discussion_r893109311, the current code to construct a `miniscript::Node` could cause a blowup on large fuzzer inputs. This is because:\r\n1. The duplicate key check is redundantly done at parsing time, since we will recursively create miniscript nodes and the constructor will unconditionally look for duplicate across this node's keys and all its sub-nodes'.\r\n2. We don't put an upper bound on the size of the inputs to consider for parsing.\r\n\r\nTo avoid wasteful computation, and prevent the blowup on some fuzzer inputs, limit the size of reasonable inputs and only perform the check for duplicate keys once when parsing.\r\nRegarding the duplicate key check bypass in the constructor we iterated on different approaches, and eventually settled on passing a dummy argument. Albeit less elegant, all other approaches required getting rid of `std::make_shared` and adding an allocation *per node created*.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains code from Pieter Wuille (see commits).\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25824.",

      "body": "You are right, `n:older(12)` shouldn't be called \"sane\". But to call it \"sane\" one should use `IsSaneTopLevel()`.\r\n\r\nI think that the check for a fragment's sanity should be context-less, and the requirement for signature depends on the context. To take back the example from above `n:older(12)` shouldn't be called sane on its own, but it should in the context of `and_b(n:older(12),s:pk(A))`. So it should only be called insane if not 's' and is the top level fragment. That's what `IsSaneTopLevel()` is.\r\nIt's not purely theoretical, for instance we use this in #24148 to find the deepest insane sub of an insane Miniscript: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24148/files#diff-a55760aaec4bce216663f5ebf65823516347356a8320d30459427149f7bbc2c5R824-R831. If the `IsSane()` check is context-dependent it gets messy.\r\n\r\nNow, maybe there is a point for the need for a better naming of these methods.",

On the other hand it's hard not to do so and to keep the `const`ness of the `NodeRef`. Here are different approaches i tried:\r\n- Cache the duplicate key result only once we call it https://github.com/darosior/bitcoin/tree/miniscript_cache_dup_key_check. Needs to drop the constness.\r\n- Conditionally skip the check in the constructor, in order to only do it for the top level node https://github.com/darosior/bitcoin/tree/miniscript_skip_dup_key_check. Doesn't drop the constness but not elegant..\r\n- Don't cache it at all https://github.com/darosior/bitcoin/tree/miniscript_no_dup_key_cache",
