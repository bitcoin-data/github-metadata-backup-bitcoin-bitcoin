The latter is good for catching integer overflows and similar stuff resulting from \"extreme\" inputs.\r\n\r\nAlso the unit testing performs a couple of thousand test eviction rounds whereas the fuzzing test runs indefinitely :)\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to _both_ unit test and fuzz test `SelectNodeToEvict` since that function is of extreme importance :)",
