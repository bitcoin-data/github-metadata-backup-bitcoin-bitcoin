    "body": "This PR updates the `CWallet::chainStateFlushed` method to write the `m_last_block_processed` locator to the database as the wallet's best block instead of the chain tip locator.\r\n\r\nSaving the last block processed locator as the best block is less fragile than saving `chainStateFlushed` locator as best block.\r\n\r\nRight now wallet code relies on `blockConnected` notifications being sent before `chainStateFlushed` notifications, and on the `chainStateFlushed` locator pointing to the last connected block. But this is a fragile assumption that can be easily broken by `ActivateBestChain`/`ConnectTrace` changes, and in fact is currently broken (since d96c59cc5cd2f73f1f55c133c52208671fe75ef3 from #25740) when the assumeutxo snapshot block is validated. In that case the background validation `chainStateFlushed` notification is sent _before_ the `blockConnected` notification so writing the locator as the best block would record a best block that was never processed. This specific change does not cause a problem for the wallet, because the wallet ignores events from the background validation chainstate. But nothing prevents similar out-of-order `chainStateFlushed` notifications from being sent in the future, so it is safer for the wallet to not rely on the chain tip sent in `chainStateFlushed` notifications.\r\n\r\nA good followup to this change would probably be to drop the `ChainStateFlushed` locator argument entirely so it is not misused in the future. Indexing code already stopped using this locator argument a long time ago for identifying the best block (in 4368384f1d267b011e03a805f934f5c47e2ca1b2 from #14121), though it is currently using the locator argument to log diagnostic warnings.",

      "message": "wallet: Avoid potentially writing incorrect best block locator\n\nI noticed while debugging #24230 that the ChainStateFlushed notification can be\nsent with a locator pointing to a different block than the block in the last\nBlockConnected notification. This is bad because it could cause the wallet to\nrecord that it is synced to a later block than it ever processed, and make it\npotentially fail to scan blocks for relevant transactions if it is unloaded and\nreloaded.\n\nThis problem should probably not happen in practice, because normally the\nlocator in the ChainStateFlushed notification does point to the block sent in\nthe last BlockConnected notification. But because of the way ActivateBestChain\naccumulates block connected notifications, and the fact that FlushStateToDisk\nis called from many different code paths, this isn't guaranteed. (The new\nassumeutxo logic also introduces a situation where this is never the case: when\nthe background chain reaches the snapshot height and validates the snapshot,\nthe background chain is flushed before block connected notifications are sent.)\n\nIn any case, it is better if the wallet writes a locator actually pointing to\nthe last block that it processed instead of writing the locator validation code\npasses to ChainStateFlushed, so this commit switches to the right locator.\n\nA good followup to this change would probably be to drop the ChainStateFlushed\nlocator argument entirely so it is not misused in the future. Indexing code\nalready stopped using this locator argument a long time ago for identifying the\nbest block (in 4368384f1d267b011e03a805f934f5c47e2ca1b2 from #14121), but it is\nstill using the locator argument to log diagnostic warnings.",

It seems like the better thing to do would be to update the best block record every time we finish processing a block in `blockConnected`, and just ignore `chainStateFlushed`. The best block is really only used during loading anyways to figure out how much we need to rescan. One thing that could happen if we did this is that on an unclean shutdown, the wallet could store a record that is ahead of the chainstate. On the next load, we would end up resetting to maybe a few blocks behind where the chainstate is at and therefore rescan a bit more than necessary, but that doesn't seem like it would really be a problem.",

      "body": "> I'm now wondering whether the wallet should even be doing anything on ChainStateFlushed since that doesn't seem like it should have any bearing on what the wallet knows about.\r\n\r\nNotifications are sent in order, so it does have some meaning. It means wallet is in-between blockConnected events and synchronized up to some block, and that the node has written some data to disk recently, so the wallet may want write its data to disk, too.\r\n\r\nI think the only problem with the ChainStateFlushed notification is that because of the fact that `FlushStateToDisk` is called all over validation code, and notifications are asynchronous, the ChainStateFlushed locator argument is unreliable and buggy. The argument is also unnecessary for wallets and indexes because they already know the last block that they are synced to and don't need a redundant pointer to a potentially incorrect block (due to a bug on assumeutxo code or other other fragile parts of validation code).",
