    "body": "edited: This PR has been squashed with a few revisions from the initial PR. The unsquashed version is still available here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...JeremyRubin:cuckoocache-pull-request-not-squashed. The PR message has also been updated to reflect the current squashed version more closely.\n# Summary\n\nThis PR replaces the boost::unordered_set in sigcache with CuckooCache::cache.\n# Benefits\n- Better memory utilization (no pointers/linked lists/stored hashes)\n- Lock Free concurrent reads and erases\n- Lazy Deletion of entries (potentially beneficial in case of re-orgs)\n- Low cache thrashing -- a standard lookup and erase should only require ~9 cache lines (Hash 0..Hash 7, and erase flag)\n- Allocation free design\n- Insert guaranteed to terminate\n- Generations smartly delete older entries before newer ones\n# Design\n\nThe CuckooCache uses a design similar to a [Cuckoo Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing). Each key inserted has a hash function 0 through hash function 7 (h0..h7).\n- Lookup(k) is a matter of examining location h0(k)..h7(k).\n- Insert(k) first sees if h0(k)..h7(k) is empty, and insets to one if so. If not, insert swaps k with the key at one more than the last hash location (so it goes in a cycle through h0..h7) and attempts to insert the swapped out key at it's other location, repeating (up to a limit) if necessary. At that limit, the last entry is dropped. Insert also checks a heuristic (described below) to age a generation before trying to insert.\n- Delete(k) first does a Lookup(k), then marks the corresponding bit in an std::atomic<uint8_t> as set as a relaxed atomic operation.\n\nMore information about the synchronization specification is in the code documentation.\n## Generation Heuristic\n\nA bit vector is used to track if the element belongs to the current or prior generation. Once the number of the current generation's non-deleted elements exceeds ~45%, the generation is retired. The previously retired generation is marked deleted. Because the cache deletes lazily, these entries are still present but are more likely to be overwritten than elements in the currently retired generation. Generations are scanned to see if they should be retired using a heuristic of how many inserts would need to occur since the last scan to exceed the generation size.\n\nThere is a slight (1-bit per entry) memory overhead to this approach. This does not negatively impact this cache because the trade off is worth it for intelligently deleting older entries. Only one bit is used for simplicity, as we get three represented states (deleted, old, current). Using more generations (lets say, 1 more bit) would allow for more granular freeing of only the oldest quarter and not half per scan. This has advantages, but also an additional memory cost and two generations was sufficient for this use case.\n# Simulation\n\nThese simulation results are slightly outdated, @morcos will chime in below with some updated figures. It should be better/the same as below.\n~~This can overall be seen as a 40% improvement on validation times over master on a 16 core machine simulated over a month. The simulation methodology sends relayed transactions and blocks to the node in the order they were received historically. On 4 and 1 core simulations, the improvement is not significant (but no worse). Our tests didn't really hit hard saturation on the cache, which suggests that the megabytes allocated to the cache could be reduced.~~\n# Testing\n\nThe PR includes a test suite which checks a few key properties:\n1. Check that values not inserted are never readable\n2. Check that a reasonable hit rate is achieved\n3. Check that erased elements are inserted on reasonably well rather than replacing fresh contents\n4. Test that (3) holds when erases are in parallel.\n# Future Work\n\nThere are future optimizations which may be able to bring some of the advantages seen with 16 cores to 4 and 1 cores, but this PR is focused on a minimal complexity patch with a demonstrable improvement over main as a base for future work in this direction.\n\nThere are also a few cleanup related items (such as cache initialization) which are not done in this patch to make it a minimal code change. These can be fixed in a later PR if this is accepted.\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to @morcos, @sdaftuar, and @TheBlueMatt for their assistance and review on this patch.\n",

      "body": "I just pushed up 4 commits which further improve the cuckoo cache. These commits add epochs/generations for the cache entries which improves the hit rate. Below is a brief description of the changes, for more detail, see the code & code documentation.\n\nThe first 2 commits are changes to the tests. The first commit simplifies what is checked in the existing tests (it was over specific to that Cache's design). The second adds a new test which fails under the existing code because the code does not prioritize newer entries.\n\nThe third patch adds generations to cache which work as follows: a bit vector is used to track if the element belongs to the current or prior generation. Once the number of the current generation's non-deleted elements exceeds ~45%, the generation is retired. The previously retired generation is marked deleted. Because the cache deletes lazily, these entries are still present but are more likely to be overwritten than elements in the currently retired generation. Generations are scanned to see if they should be retired using a heuristic of how many inserts would need to occur since the last scan to exceed the generation size.\n\nThe fourth commit increases the number of hashes used per element from 2 to 8. The benefit of this change is that it permits using a large generation size (e.g., 45%) compared to 2 hashes (30%). A larger generation size is the \"effective size\" of the cache, i.e., new entries stay in the current generation for longer.\n\nPerformance is markedly better, especially under attack scenarios. @morcos has run several simulations which back up this claim. \n\nThere is a slight (1-bit per entry) memory overhead to this approach. This does not negatively impact this cache because the trade off is worth it for intelligently deleting older entries. Only one bit is used for simplicity, as we get three represented states (deleted, old, current). Using more generations (lets say, 1 more bit) would allow for more granular freeing of only the oldest quarter and not half per scan. This has advantages, but also an additional memory cost and two generations was sufficient for this use case.\n\nOn a slightly separate note, another side benefit of this cache that I failed to mention when I opened the PR (before these added commits) is that inserts are guaranteed to terminate (in the sigcache currently in master, insert may run forever if GetRand is \"unlucky\").\n",

Lock contention on the sig cache is a serious bottleneck to ConnectBlock performance with 8 or more cores.  This patch appears to all but eliminate that contention and leads to a 40% improvement in ConnectBlock time for 16 cores.  It also allows for further performance improvements that would not see any benefit until this bottleneck was removed.\n\nI have also tested the hit rate performance and it is a significant improvement over the existing sigcache in the event of a spam attack, for a long running node, or in the event of a reorg.\n\nIn addition to reviewing the included tests, I've also run my own tests and done code review to be sure that there are no false positives.\n",

      "body": "@fanquake yeah it'll be tough, there's not much speed improvement from losing the erase locks until ~8 cores. What you could test is better memory efficiency by allocating smaller caches (2 4 8 16...) and comparing performance to a node running with that size and the old cache. I'd recommend running one node and peering your test nodes exclusively thought that to ensure nodes are getting the same messages for a given time. But if you're hardware limited that will be hard.\n",

We can't detect actual cache hits v.s. misses with just the `CachingTransactionSignatureChecker::VerifySignature` as it just returns a `bool`. As this would require a bit of restructuring, it's probably easiest review that as a separate PR, if needed.",

If I could come up with a test suite that exercised the logic sufficiently to make changes like this safer, then I'd happily suggest that, but it seems like a hard problem.  Still, after reviewing I'm comfortable enough with this PR to proceed without additional sigcache tests (and it's great that we have tests for the cuckoocache at least).\r\n",

          "body": "This PR adds the cuckoocache data structure to Grin. Cuckoocache has some unique advantages over a typical LRU cache. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8895 for more discussion and https://github.com/JeremyRubin/cuckoocache https://docs.rs/cuckoocache/0.1.0/cuckoocache/.\r\n\r\nThe primary benefit to Grin codebase is that Cuckoocache is threadsafe, meaning it can be read and erased from without requiring mutability. This enables multiple concurrent threads to use it for validation at once, through the RWLock::read. \r\n\r\nI've added the Cuckoocache as an independent crate, like the LRU cache is. The LRU cache has a dependency on https://github.com/contain-rs/linked-hash-map, which is in \"Maitnence mode\". It has an extensive test suite, which I ported from the implementation used in bitcoin (I authored it -- hence re-licensing under my name), and no dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nA couple points:\r\n\r\n1) in the current patch, we never call contains with discardable=true. This means entries will only be deleted via the generation maturity (which is closer to LRU behavior). When might we validate and be OK erasing the previously validated results?\r\n2) Technically, because of hashing, there is no need to have two separate caches, we could just have a single `verificationcache<SomeEnum<Type1, Type2>>` or `VerificationCache<Hash>`.\r\n3) I haven't done extensive performance testing of this versus the original code\r\n4) I didn't refactor the name from LRUCache to something like CuckooCache as it seemed easier to do it in a non functional patch later.\r\n",

      "body": "Apologies, long rambly response below:\n\nOverall, I think it's a reasonable idea to do this. Modulo is slow. It's not the bottleneck, but it's a low cost way to make this code faster.\n\nThere are a couple of weird things though. You have currently about 2 bits of bookkeeping overhead per entry (one bit for erasure, one bit for epoch). If you're restricting to a power of two size for the main cache memory, you also may as well do some of the following if the user specifies more space: more generations for finer grained generations; additional fee tracking to preferentially evict low fee items; some kind of mempool pointer/index map to evict signatures on mempool eviction. (preface: I don't like this idea, but for sake of discussion) You could also keep a large and a small cache and look up from both; letting you target size = 2^m + 2^n.\n\nAlso, power of two works reasonably well low in the series (1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128) but it seems to be kind of uncomfortably that at say a 1GB cache you have to choose between 1 and 2 GB if you want to increase a little bit. Yes, sqrt, but people have fixed memory sizes so it does kind of matter.\n\nMaybe a better inbetween would be to do as (roughly) follows (should work on GCC, clang, and msvc):\n\n```\nDEFAULT_MAX_SIGCACHE_SIZE = 32;\n#ifdef __MSC_VER\n#include <intrin.h>\n#define __builtin_popcount __popcnt\n#endif\nbool fast_mod = __builtin_popcount(size) == 1;\ncompute_hash(E e) {\n    if (fast_mod)\n        // compute hash with masks\n    else\n       // compute hash with mod\n}\n```\n\nand by default not count the bookkeeping bits in the size computation. That way if you pass in a power of two megabytes as the parameter, you get this magic boost in performance, and if you pass in a non power of two if you get what you asked for. The branch shouldn't hurt because it should be easily predicted.\n",

      "body": "Yes there is a reason.\n\nThe locks aren't actually needed at all how the cache is currently used. All that needs to happen is per thread: at the beginning of a block processing, a memory acquire; at the end of block processing a memory release. Additionally, one more lock must be acquired before block processing by the master to ensure that there are no concurrent writers (from addtomempool) and that master must not release until all slaves release as well. This is much better than the repeated acquire/release of locking/unlocking on every single signature operation.\n\nI have written a version of the code which has this semantics, but some feedback from others felt that it was fragile & prone to someone else breaking that behavior down the line (bad for maintainability). In the interest of keeping that optimization available and not introducing a maintenance hazard, I kept the locking where it was in the \"layer up\".\n",
