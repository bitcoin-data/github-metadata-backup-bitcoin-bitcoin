    "body": "The weekly meeting on [2017-12-07](http://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/bitcoin-core-dev/2017/bitcoin-core-dev.2017-12-07-19.00.log.html) discussed allowing options to bitcoin to have some sensitivity to what network is in use. @theuni suggested having sections in the config file:\r\n\r\n    <cfields> an alternative to that would be sections in a config file. and on the\r\n              cmdline they'd look like namespaces. so, [testnet] port=5. or -testnet::port=5.\r\n\r\nThis approach is (more or less) supported by `boost::program_options::detail::config_file_iterator` -- when it sees a `[testnet]` section with `port=5`, it will treat that the same as \"testnet.port=5\". So `[testnet] port=5` (or `testnet.port=5` without the section header) in bitcoin.conf and `-testnet.port=5` on the command line.\r\n\r\nThe other aspect to this question is possibly limiting some options so that there is no possibility of accidental cross-contamination across networks. For example, if you're using a particular wallet.dat on mainnet, you may not want to accidentally use the same wallet on testnet and risk reusing keys.\r\n\r\nI've set this up so that the `-addnode` and `-wallet` options are `NETWORK_ONLY`, so that if you have a bitcoin.conf:\r\n\r\n    wallet=/secret/wallet.dat\r\n    upnp=1\r\n\r\nand you run `bitcoind -testnet` or `bitcoind -regtest`, then the `wallet=` setting will be ignored, and should behave as if your bitcoin.conf had specified:\r\n\r\n    upnp=1\r\n\r\n    [main]\r\n    wallet=/secret/wallet.dat\r\n\r\nFor any `NETWORK_ONLY` options, if you're using `-testnet` or `-regtest`, you'll have to add the prefix to any command line options. This was necessary for `multiwallet.py` for instance.\r\n\r\nI've left the \"default\" options as taking precedence over network specific ones, which might be backwards. So if you have:\r\n\r\n    maxmempool=200\r\n    [regtest]\r\n    maxmempool=100\r\n\r\nyour maxmempool will still be 200 on regtest. The advantage of doing it this way is that if you have `[regtest] maxmempool=100` in bitcoin.conf, and then say `bitcoind -regtest -maxmempool=200`, the same result is probably in line with what you expect...\r\n\r\nThe other thing to note is that I'm using the chain names from `chainparamsbase.cpp` / `ChainNameFromCommandLine`, so the sections are `[main]`, `[test]` and `[regtest]`; not `[mainnet]` or `[testnet]` as might be expected.\r\n\r\nThoughts?

Then if `-regtest.maxmempool=100` is an explicit argument as well as `-maxmempool=200`, the explicit regtest one should take precedence IMO.\r\n\r\nThen following this logic, `-wallet` specified explicitly as an argument should be used on regtest and testnet as well, using `regtest.wallet` should only be necessary in the config file to save confusion",

Unless I'm missing something, I don't think #10267 provides an easy way of doing per-network config files, so wouldn't work well for that particular use case.\r\n\r\nThis patch doesn't include any tests, so is marked as WIP.

      "body": "Great. Thanks for tackling this @ajtowns. A few high-level suggestions:\r\n\r\n- I agree with @MeshCollider that the order of precedence should be Command Line > Config File network-specific > Config File default.\r\n- I think there shouldn't be network-specific command-line options (that's almost an implication of the above). I agree with MeshCollider that the user should call `bitcoind` with `-wallet`, not `-regtest.wallet` (side-note - choosing a wallet from the wrong network is perhaps less of a problem than you might assume, since `-wallet` is already kind of network-specific as it refers to the name of the wallet in the particular network directory).\r\n- as well as `NETWORK_ONLY`, perhaps we want a `DEFAULT_ONLY` for options that shouldn't be overriden in the network-specific config. Namely those options would be `-regtest` and `-testnet`. For example don't want the following pathological config file to be valid:\r\n```\r\ntestnet\r\n[testnet]\r\nregtest\r\n[regtest]\r\nnotestnet\r\nnoregtest\r\n```\r\n- taking this further, perhaps we should deprecate the use of `testnet` and `regtest` in the config file entirely, so you can only select the network by using a command-line option?\r\n- I've avoided nitting your code at this early point, but I'd point you at the developer notes here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md, specifically symbol naming.  Your new `ArgsManager` members should be prefixed `m_` for example.",

      "body": "Okay, getting that behaviour requires marginally more invasive changes, but I think it's worth it (and they're not *that* invasive). New patch series accompanying this comment which:\r\n\r\n * has arg precedence being: command-line arguments, net-specific config file options, default config file options\r\n * will only use config file options for -addnode and -wallet if you're on mainnet or put them in the right [regtest] or [testnet] section or add a `regtest.` or `testnet.` prefix\r\n * only allows -testnet and -regtest to be specified in the default section or on the command line (ie, [regtest] testnet=1 silliness is silently ignored)\r\n * for single-value options, precedence is (a) last value specified on the command line, (b) first value specified in the network section of the config file, and finally (c) first value specified in the default section of the config file. the last vs first difference between cli and conf is weird, but matches current behaviour. the code would be slightly improved by making it consistent.\r\n\r\nI think that should behave pretty much as expected -- specifying things on the command line will always take effect, having a testnet specific config and just invoking \"bitcoind -conf=testnet.conf\" should work fine, having separate configs for mainnet, regtest and testnet in a single file with different options should work too.\r\n\r\nFrom the code side of things, I've made a bunch of changes:\r\n\r\n * I've dropped mapArgs, and split mapMultiArgs into mapOverrideArgs (for cli arguments are ForceSetArg) and mapConfigArgs (for config files)\r\n * I've listed the net-specific options explicitly in util.cpp rather than having each use of the options specify that they're net-specific; seems simpler and much more robust.\r\n * I've moved ChainNameFromCommandLine from chainparamsbase into util, so it can have more precise access to how -testnet/-regtest were specified\r\n * I've dropped the filename argument from ReadConfigFile and split most of the logic into ReadConfigStream, which makes it more unit-testable\r\n\r\nI've added some unit tests, but they're a bit basic; I haven't done a functional test either. (And it's still a bit early for detailed code style nits, though I've tried to make a token effort to avoid them :) )\r\n\r\nEdit: Oh, the previous pass is commit 907dd64994e945a30833200ce1131840b06c8ab7 at https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/tree/netconf-sections-v1 on the off chance someone wants to look at it.",

      "body": "Okay, here's something for first pass reviews I think.\r\n\r\nThe first five commits do some refactoring on ChainNameFromCommandLine (moving it from chainparamsbase.cpp into util.cpp:ArgsManager) and ReadConfigFile, primarily to make it easier to add tests for both of them.\r\n\r\n    c5b5997e1 Move ChainNameFromCommandLine into ArgsManager\r\n    eedd60951 [tests] Add unit tests for ChainNameFromCommandLine\r\n    f1665f160 Separate out ReadConfigStream from ReadConfigFile\r\n    0e78382c3 [tests] Add unit tests for ReadConfigStream\r\n    d4367e1c6 [tests] Check ChainNameFromCommandLine works with config entries\r\n\r\nThe next commit switches from mapArgs and mapMultiArgs (for single and multi value options) to mapConfigArgs and mapOverrideArgs (for config file options and commandline/forceset options).\r\n\r\n    bdb0c2857 ArgsManager: keep command line and config file arguments separate\r\n\r\nThe next commit is the first one that should change behaviour, and does most of the work. Unit test, and update to functional test are in the following commits.\r\n\r\n    0e6679466 ArgManager: add support for config sections\r\n    7a51198d3 [tests] Unit tests for config file sections\r\n    359c78e2e [tests] Use regtest section in functional tests configs\r\n\r\nThe next commit changes the behaviour of the addnode, connect, port, bind, rpcport, rpcbind and wallet options: when they're specified in the config file they'll only apply to mainnet unless you use a [regtest] or [test] header (or a \"regtest.\" or \"test.\" prefix).\r\n\r\n    7be1ddd31 ArgsManager: limit some options to only apply on mainnet when in default section\r\n    c031709db [tests] Unit tests for section-specific config entries\r\n\r\nPenultimately, there's special handling for the -regtest and -testnet options, so that ChainNameFromCommandLine will ignore bogus entries like \"[regtest] testnet=1\" or \"[regtest] noregtest\" and won't return weird results if invoked after the initial call to Select(Base)Params() with a pathological config file like that. cf jnewbery's comments in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11862#issuecomment-350753811\r\n\r\n    2933f6016 ArgsManager: special handling for -regtest and -testnet\r\n    22da57f19 [tests] Unit tests for -testnet/-regtest in [test]/[regtest] sections\r\n\r\nAnd finally there's also an update for the release notes.\r\n\r\n    ee91028e7 Add config changes to release notes\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nI've called the member variables things like \"m_mapConfigArgs\" rather than fully snake-case map_config_args or similar as a compromise between the coding style and what's already in use in the class.\r\n\r\nI needed a few helper functions with access to protected ArgsManager member variables; rather than add them to util.h directly, I made a friend class for them, ArgsManagerHelper. It's not crazy pretty but it seems alright. Maybe they should go in util_helper.h or similar though?\r\n\r\nI got the locks wrong for cs_args and csPathCached initially -- was tempted to add \"AssetLockNotHeld(gArgs.cs_args)\" to GetDataDir to help avoid this, but it runs into two problems: in some threads GetDataDir() is called before any locks are acquired leaving lockstack==nullptr and causing a segfault (which can easily be avoided by just adding the assert after LOCK(csPathCached)); and cs_args is protected so it would've required another ArgsManagerHelper functions.\r\n\r\nThe datadir option is a little tricky. Currently you have three options:\r\n\r\n  - don't specify -datadir anywhere, just use the default\r\n  - specify -datadir on the command line\r\n  - specify -datadir in the config file only (the config file may be located via the default datadir)\r\n\r\nWith these patches it would be possible to have a fourth option: specify datadir in the applicable network section of the configfile, allowing a single config file to specify different datadirs for regtest and testnet. At present the code locks datadir into place before selecting the network, so that hasn't been implemented in this PR.\r\n\r\nThe fact that -addnode, -connect, etc only apply to main net is specified in util.cpp rather than in the files that care about the options. This is something that can be cleaned up in the rework of argument handling that @MeshCollider has been working on.\r\n\r\nI think the approach makes sense at this point, so reviews appreciated and nits welcome I guess!",

The only thing holding up that PR is disagreement about what to do about an obscure never-meant-to-be-supported edge case in the old option parser. Hopefully everyone's universal dislike of Boost is sufficient to achieve consensus on that issue.",

As a consequence, I've broken out the first set of refactoring/testing patches into its on PR (#12878) which includes some additional tests for the current behaviour of negated options. For this PR, the way I've handled things is to make \"-nofoo\" empty the vector of values for \"foo\", and to consider an empty vector an indication that the arg is negated. I think that ends up behaving reasonably logically, and the changes are hopefully indicated in the corresponding unit tests.\r\n\r\nEDIT: bah, github ordering is wrong, i'll fix the dates and bump the PR again. fixed and bumped.",

What we have used so far as pseudo-documentation is the config generator from @jlopp https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/\r\nHowever, it neither contains a `[general]` section like mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11862#issuecomment-381230551 and places the `testnet=1` option currently under the `[debug]` section. This doesn't work anymore and bitcoind seems to completely ignore the `testnet=1` option if it's under the `[debug]` section.\r\n\r\nWe second @NicolasDorier, 0.17 breaks [our templated approach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhiverbox/armbian-userpatches/master/overlay/opt/zhiverbox/scripts/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf.src) and [install assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhiverbox/armbian-userpatches/master/overlay/opt/zhiverbox/scripts/install/50_install-bitcoind.sh) as well, which we use on the [zHIVErbox](https://github.com/zhiverbox/armbian-userpatches/blob/master/README.md) - a low cost, TAILS-inspired security fortess. Looks like a refactoring is needed to support 0.17, which might be OK if it's backwards compatible and the config templates still work on <0.17? But if we need to maintain separate templates for different bitcoin versions it get's ugly.",

Network-only options was a good idea to prevent users from accidentally polluting their mainnet config with testnet or regtest config, but the amount of user pain inflicted by not having backwards compatibility means we should revert this change quickly.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, it didn't even occur to me that this PR would break backwards compatibility. I certainly don't think it was an intentional break.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could only enforce the 'network-only' rule if the config file contains a network section. That means that old config files would continue to be valid, but new config files with network sections would be protected from certain config errors. That can be added later (after the reversion) if people think that 'network-only' config is a feature worth having.",

The newly documented behaviors are: command line [ignored arguments](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/69d44f3cc75a68d404ca0e1ca2b4831fd2bac4bb/src/util/system.cpp#L323-L326) and [more ignored arguments](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/69d44f3cc75a68d404ca0e1ca2b4831fd2bac4bb/src/util/settings.cpp#L67-L72), and config file [reverse precedence](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/69d44f3cc75a68d404ca0e1ca2b4831fd2bac4bb/src/util/settings.cpp#L61-L65), [inconsistently applied top-level settings](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/69d44f3cc75a68d404ca0e1ca2b4831fd2bac4bb/src/util/settings.cpp#L55-L59), and [zombie values](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/69d44f3cc75a68d404ca0e1ca2b4831fd2bac4bb/src/util/settings.cpp#L101-L108).\r\n\r\nThe original motivation for this change was to make it easy to add a new persistent setting source without introducing more bugs and inconsistencies. Two commits building on top of this to add a persistent `-wallet` setting are pretty straightforward and show how the new code can be extended:\r\n\r\n* 70675c3e4975203ad6222ba2b00c83b4e4213793 from #15935 – _Add \\<datadir>/settings.json persistent settings storage_\r\n* 04c80c40df9fc6f4734ba238ea7f65607cf88089 from #15937 – _Add loadwallet and createwallet RPC load_on_startup options_",
