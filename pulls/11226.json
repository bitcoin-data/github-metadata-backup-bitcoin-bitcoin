    "body": "Add additional Clang thread safety analysis annotations as discussed with @sipa (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10866#issuecomment-316238630) and others.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to #10866 ~~which this PR is rebased upon (awaiting merge of #10866). The first three commits (8a1dc09, e022990 and cbae151) can be reviewed in #10866.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR contains three types of changes:\r\n1. Add missing locks (based on the `GUARDED_BY(...)` analysis below). Please review thoroughly.\r\n2. Add `GUARDED_BY(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n3. Add `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(...)` annotations to allow for Clang's thread safety analysis at compile-time. Does not change run-time behaviour.\r\n\r\nBackground reading: The [\"C/C++ Thread Safety Analysis\"](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/42958.pdf) paper (Hutchins, Ballman & Sutherland, 2014) paper describing Clang thread safety analysis and how it is used for the Google C++ codebase:\r\n\r\n> They essentially provide a static type system for threads, and can detect potential race conditions and deadlocks. This paper describes Clang Thread Safety Analysis, a tool which uses annotations to declare and enforce thread safety policies in C and C++ programs.\r\n> […]\r\n> It has been deployed on a large scale at Google; all C++ code at Google is now compiled with thread safety analysis enabled by default.\r\n> […]\r\n> The `GUARDED_BY` attribute declares that a thread must lock `mu` before it can read or write to `balance`, thus ensuring that the increment and decrement operations are atomic. Similarly, `REQUIRES` declares that the calling thread must lock mu before calling `withdrawImpl`. Because the caller is assumed to have locked `mu,` it is safe to modify `balance` within the body of the method.",

      "body": "@sipa @TheBlueMatt @laanwj Thanks for reviewing and thanks for the encouragement! Do you happen to know which core developers that would be appropriate reviewers for this work (on a deeper `GUARDED_BY(…)` level for each module)?\r\n\r\nThe types of errors I might need some help from reviewers to avoid:\r\n* False positives: Too restrictive lock requirements. Requiring a lock where a lock is not needed. More concretely: unnecessary `GUARDED_BY(…)` annotations. (The `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(…)` annotations follow more or less mechanically for the `GUARDED_BY(…)`.)\r\n* False negatives: Missing lock requirements. Not requiring a lock where a lock is needed. More concretely: missing `GUARDED_BY(…)` annotations.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps most importantly: help reviewing that the *added* locks in this PR looks reasonable. In constrast to the annotations they alter run-time behaviour.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of `AssertLockHeld(…)`:s that I've been unable to map to variables being guarded. I might need some help to track those down to add the corresponding `GUARDED_BY(…)`:s (and hence `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(…)`). I'm a bit hesitant to just add `EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(…)` to match the `AssertLockHeld(…)` (which would be trivial) since that methodology hides the fact that the guard required hasn't been explicitly stated using an `GUARDED_BY(…)` annotation yet.",

It may very well be the case that you'd miss a NotifyWatchonlyChanged fire if you have an AddWatchOnly and a RemoveWatchOnly call at the same time (though I don't know if there are any negative effects from doing so).\r\n* RescanFromTime indeed does not appear to require cs_wallet (obviously ScanForWalletTransactions does, but it takes it itself).

          "body": "Currently only a tiny fraction of all `LOCK(...)`:s are documented with information on why each lock is held.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of such comments it can sometimes be hard to see why a specific lock is held from merely reading the code. This risks leading to situations where redundant `LOCK(...)`:s are kept by mistake or \"just to be safe\" after refactoring, etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the situation by adding comments with information on why a specific lock is being held by adding a comment using the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLOCK(cs_lockName); // variableBeingGuardedByThisLock, FunctionRequiringHoldingThisLock(...)\r\n…\r\nvariableBeingGuardedByThisLock += 1;\r\n…\r\nFunctionRequiringHoldingThisLock(someThing);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this patch there were 9 documented and 514 undocumented `LOCK`/`LOCK2`:s –\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep -E \"[^a-zA-Z_](LOCK|LOCK2)\\(\" -- \"*.h\" \"*.cpp\" | grep -v sync.h | grep \"//\" | wc -l\r\n9\r\n$ git grep -E \"[^a-zA-Z_](LOCK|LOCK2)\\(\" -- \"*.h\" \"*.cpp\" | grep -v sync.h | grep -v \"//\" | wc -l\r\n514\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this patch there are 405 documented and 118 undocumented `LOCK`/`LOCK2`:s – \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep -E \"[^a-zA-Z_](LOCK|LOCK2)\\(\" -- \"*.h\" \"*.cpp\" | grep -v sync.h | grep \"//\" | wc -l\r\n405\r\n$ git grep -E \"[^a-zA-Z_](LOCK|LOCK2)\\(\" -- \"*.h\" \"*.cpp\" | grep -v sync.h | grep -v \"//\" | wc -l\r\n118\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that there are still some locks left that are undocumented. I need help identifying the variable that is ultimately being guarded by each of these locks (it could be that some of these locks are unnecessary - if so, let me know!).\r\n\r\nPlease help by browsing the remaining undocumented locks using ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep -3 -n -E '^[^/#]*[^A-Z_](LOCK|LOCK2)\\([^/]*$' -- \"*.cpp\" \"*.h\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n... and see if you can help bring clarity. Each undocumented guarded variable that can be identified helps a lot - just leave a comment on the missing lock/guarded variable pair you've found and I'll track down all instances of that combination and add the appropriate comments :-)\r\n\r\nThat will be of great help for this comment PR and also for the related thread-safety annotations PR that I'm working on (see #11226).",

          "body": "BanMan is not a bad Man, he's just a different class of Man. He's an ex-ConnMan Man, looking to take a different path and make a new namespace for himself.\r\n\r\nBeware BanMan's banhammer as he banishes bandits with the bandwidth to jam him. Not standing for non-canon, he’ll ban and he’ll ban. Some heroes wear capes, but BanMan? A Bandana.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDespite the diff size, this is mostly move-only. It breaks the ban/unban functions out of CConnman and into a new class because, while logically bans are tied to connections, they're really just entries in a database. Like CConnman, a global is still required due to RPC (and qt). I plan to address this along with CAddrMan, which I'll be breaking out next.\r\n\r\nThis also makes testing easier as different implementations can be dropped in.\r\n\r\nThere are a few small behavioral changes here, which are pretty insignificant:\r\n- Banning no longer implies disconnecting. If you want both, you need to call both.\r\n- For simplicity, The ban db is read in the constructor, meaning that it happens in init rather than net.\r\n- RPC returns RPC_DATABASE_ERROR if the bandb is not loaded. This should not be possible now, but the idea is for future changes to allow us to disable p2p but still interact with the ban commands.",

Sounds good?\r\n\r\nRegarding the latter, should I submit the annotation PR:s on a per-lock basis (i.e. one PR with all `cs_wallet` annotations, etc.)?",
