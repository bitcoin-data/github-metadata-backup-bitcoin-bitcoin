    "body": "#26742 significantly increased the http server shutdown speed, but also introduced a bug (#27722 - see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27722#issuecomment-1559453982 for steps to reproduce on master) that causes http server shutdown to halt in case of a remote client disconnection. This happens because `evhttp_request_set_on_complete_cb` is never called and thus the request is never removed from `g_requests`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that bug, and improves robustness of the code by encapsulating the request tracking logic. Earlier approaches (#27909, #27245, #19434) attempted to resolve this but [imo are fundamentally unsafe](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27909#discussion_r1265614783) because of differences in lifetime between an `evhttp_request` and `evhttp_connection`.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to keep track of open requests or connections, we just [need to ensure](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19420#issue-648067169) that there are no active requests on server shutdown. Because a connection can have multiple requests, and a request can be completed in various ways (the request actually being handled, or the client performing a remote disconnect), keeping a counter per connection seems like the approach with the least overhead to me.\r\n\r\nFixes #27722\r\n\r\n",

I've now actually read all the context, including why the approach from 27909 is less desirable, and agree with the approach here.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I still cannot reproduce the original issue on my system with libevent version `2.1.12-stable-8ubuntu3`. I tried with a remote `bitcoin-cli` to try and rule out some local networking-fu, but master and 25.0 still seem happy to shutdown for me no matter if there are remote-closed connections outstanding... FWIW This does mean that, without a test included, I can't actually \"test\" that this fix does something new.\r\n\r\nHowever I can confirm that the changes here _also_ work for me:\r\n\r\n```log\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:35Z [http] Received a POST request for / from 127.0.0.1:51856\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Received a POST request for / from 127.0.0.1:60486\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Interrupting HTTP server\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Unregistering HTTP handler for / (exactmatch 1)\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Unregistering HTTP handler for /wallet/ (exactmatch 0)\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Stopping HTTP server\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Waiting for HTTP worker threads to exit\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Waiting for 3 connections to stop HTTP server\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Waiting for HTTP event thread to exit\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Exited http event loop\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Stopped HTTP server\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to ACK this if the suggestion from @theStack was addressed.",

I've only tested the typical \"one request per connection\" scenario via bitcoin-cli so far.\r\n\r\nI'll work on that, don't think it can be done with bitcoin-cli. I also would like to add some unit testing on `HTTPRequestTracker`, but from earlier work I've found that mocking `evhttp_request` objects proved to be a huge pain to get the memory sanitizers to pass, so I'm not sure I'll be able to get that working for this PR either (welcoming contributions there).",

      "body": "> I don't think it is possible to do two concurrent requests in one connection (at least not in HTTP 1.x).\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 supports [HTTP pipelining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining), but libevent [doesn't seem to support that](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/issues/1336#issuecomment-1243046500). Pipelining is superseded by multiplexing in HTTP/2.0, which the libevent http server hasn't implemented (but [seems possible](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/issues/1294#issue-1291999422) to add on our side, not that I think we should at this point).\r\n\r\nSo, in practice it seems like our http server will currently never have > 1 active requests per connection, but I think we still need to keep the current accounting system (i.e. a counter per connection) because:\r\n- I find it difficult to prove that > 1 request per connection can _never_ happen\r\n- it makes the existing code robust to changes in future libevent versions that do allow e.g. pipelining or multiplexing",
