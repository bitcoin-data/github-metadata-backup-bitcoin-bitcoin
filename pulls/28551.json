    "body": "#26742 significantly increased the http server shutdown speed, but also introduced a bug (#27722 - see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27722#issuecomment-1559453982 for steps to reproduce on master) that causes http server shutdown to halt in case of a remote client disconnection. This happens because `evhttp_request_set_on_complete_cb` is never called and thus the request is never removed from `g_requests`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that bug, and improves robustness of the code by encapsulating the request tracking logic. Earlier approaches (#27909, #27245, #19434) attempted to resolve this but [imo are fundamentally unsafe](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27909#discussion_r1265614783) because of differences in lifetime between an `evhttp_request` and `evhttp_connection`.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to keep track of open requests or connections, we just [need to ensure](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19420#issue-648067169) that there are no active requests on server shutdown. Because a connection can have multiple requests, and a request can be completed in various ways (the request actually being handled, or the client performing a remote disconnect), keeping a counter per connection seems like the approach with the least overhead to me.\r\n\r\nFixes #27722\r\n\r\n",
