    "body": "#26742 significantly increased the http server shutdown speed, but also introduced a bug (#27722 - see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27722#issuecomment-1559453982 for steps to reproduce on master) that causes http server shutdown to halt in case of a remote client disconnection. This happens because `evhttp_request_set_on_complete_cb` is never called and thus the request is never removed from `g_requests`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that bug, and improves robustness of the code by encapsulating the request tracking logic. Earlier approaches (#27909, #27245, #19434) attempted to resolve this but [imo are fundamentally unsafe](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27909#discussion_r1265614783) because of differences in lifetime between an `evhttp_request` and `evhttp_connection`.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to keep track of open requests or connections, we just [need to ensure](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19420#issue-648067169) that there are no active requests on server shutdown. Because a connection can have multiple requests, and a request can be completed in various ways (the request actually being handled, or the client performing a remote disconnect), keeping a counter per connection seems like the approach with the least overhead to me.\r\n\r\nFixes #27722\r\n\r\n",

I've now actually read all the context, including why the approach from 27909 is less desirable, and agree with the approach here.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I still cannot reproduce the original issue on my system with libevent version `2.1.12-stable-8ubuntu3`. I tried with a remote `bitcoin-cli` to try and rule out some local networking-fu, but master and 25.0 still seem happy to shutdown for me no matter if there are remote-closed connections outstanding... FWIW This does mean that, without a test included, I can't actually \"test\" that this fix does something new.\r\n\r\nHowever I can confirm that the changes here _also_ work for me:\r\n\r\n```log\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:35Z [http] Received a POST request for / from 127.0.0.1:51856\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Received a POST request for / from 127.0.0.1:60486\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Interrupting HTTP server\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Unregistering HTTP handler for / (exactmatch 1)\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Unregistering HTTP handler for /wallet/ (exactmatch 0)\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Stopping HTTP server\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Waiting for HTTP worker threads to exit\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Waiting for 3 connections to stop HTTP server\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Waiting for HTTP event thread to exit\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Exited http event loop\r\n2023-10-03T09:35:38Z [http] Stopped HTTP server\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to ACK this if the suggestion from @theStack was addressed.",

In a next commit, allows us to untrack all requests associated\nwith a connection without running into lifetime issues of the\nconnection living longer than the request\n(see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27909#discussion_r1265614783)\n\n2. Improve encapsulation by making the mutex and cv internal members,\nand exposing just the WaitUntilEmpty() method that can be safely\nused.\n",

I've only tested the typical \"one request per connection\" scenario via bitcoin-cli so far.\r\n\r\nI'll work on that, don't think it can be done with bitcoin-cli. I also would like to add some unit testing on `HTTPRequestTracker`, but from earlier work I've found that mocking `evhttp_request` objects proved to be a huge pain to get the memory sanitizers to pass, so I'm not sure I'll be able to get that working for this PR either (welcoming contributions there).",
