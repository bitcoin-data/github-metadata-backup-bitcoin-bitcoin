    "body": "#### # Context (Current Flow on Master)\r\n\r\nIn the transaction creation process, in order to select which coins the new transaction will spend,\r\nwe first obtain all the available coins known by the wallet, which means walking-through the\r\nwallet txes map, gathering the ones that fulfill certain spendability requirements in a vector.\r\n\r\nThis coins vector is then provided to the Coin Selection process, which first checks if the user\r\nhas manually selected any input (which could be internal, aka known by the wallet, or external),\r\nand if it does, it fetches them by searching each of them inside the wallet and/or inside the\r\nCoin Control external tx data.\r\n\r\nThen, after finding the pre-selected-inputs and gathering them in a vector, the Coin Selection\r\nprocess walks-through the entire available coins vector once more just to erase coins that are\r\nin both vectors. So the Coin Selection process doesn’t pick them twice (duplicate inputs inside\r\nthe same transaction).\r\n\r\n#### # Process Workflow Changes\r\n\r\nNow, a new method, `FetchCoins` will be responsible for:\r\n1) Lookup the user pre-selected-inputs (which can be internal or external).\r\n2) And, fetch the available coins in the wallet (excluding the already fetched ones).\r\n\r\nWhich will occur prior to the Coin Selection process. Which allows us to never include the\r\npre-selected-inputs inside the available coins vector in the first place, as well as doing other\r\nnice improvements (written below).\r\n\r\nSo, Coin Selection can perform its main responsibility without mixing it with having to fetch\r\ninternal/external coins nor any slow and unneeded duplicate coins verification.\r\n\r\n#### # Summarizing the Improvements:\r\n\r\n1) If any pre-selected-input lookup fail, the process will return the error right away.\r\n    (before, the wallet was fetching all the wallet available coins, walking through the\r\n    entire txes map, and then failing for an invalid pre-selected-input inside SelectCoins)\r\n\r\n2) The pre-selected-inputs lookup failure causes are properly described on the return error.\r\n    (before, we were returning an \"Insufficient Funds\" error for everything, even if the failure\r\n    was due a not solvable external input)\r\n\r\n3) **Faster Coin Selection**: no longer need to \"remove the pre-set inputs from the available coins\r\n    vector so that Coin Selection doesn't pick them\" (which meant to loop-over the entire\r\n    available coins vector at Coin Selection time, erasing duplicate coins that were pre-selected).\r\n   \r\n    Now, the available coins vector, which is built after the pre-selected-inputs fetching,\r\n    doesn’t include the already selected inputs in the first place.\r\n\r\n4) **Faster transaction creation** for transactions that only use manually selected inputs.\r\n\r\n    We now will return early, as soon as we finish fetching the pre-selected-inputs and\r\n    not perform the resources expensive calculation of walking-through the entire wallet\r\n    txes map to obtain the available coins (coins that we will not use).\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nAdded a new bench (f6d0bb2) measuring the transaction creation process, for a wallet with ~250k UTXO, only using the pre-selected-inputs inside coin control. Setting `m_allow_other_inputs=false` to disallow the wallet to include coins automatically.\r\n\r\n#### Result on this PR (tip f6d0bb2d):\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|        1,048,675.00 |              953.58 |    0.3% |      0.06 | `WalletCreateTransaction`\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n#### Result on master (tip 4a4289e2):\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       96,373,458.20 |               10.38 |    0.2% |      5.30 | `WalletCreateTransaction`\r\n\r\nThe benchmark took to run in master: **96.37 milliseconds**, while in this PR: **1 millisecond**  🚀 .",

The only other improvement this provides is better error reporting, but I think it would be better to just go through SelectCoins and improve its error reporting instead of pulling things out so that errors are reported elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits, (aside from what I wrote in the PR description):\r\n\r\n#### Sources Architecture:\r\n\r\n - Do make sense for you to be fetching, and verifying, coins in a function whose main responsibility is perform the Coin Selection process?\r\n \r\n    The Coin Selection should receive coins, and certain user/wallet parameters, so it can produce all the possible solutions for a certain target amount, picking and returning the best of them.\r\n\r\n\tJust imagine how this would looks like if Coin Selection would be a separated library (which, for its increasing specialization, could easily be one in the future). You would never include the pre-selected-inputs fetching and verification process into the Coin Selection responsibilities at all because cannot/shouldn't do it there.\r\n\r\n#### Tangible Improvements:\r\n\r\n1.  As we will do the pre-selected-inputs fetching and verification prior to calling `AvailableCoins`, if there is an error when the wallet fetches any of the preset-inputs, the transaction creation process can fail right away without calling `AvailableCoins` (Function that, as we know, walks-through the entire wallet's transactions map and performs all the internal available coins checks).\r\n \r\n     This prevents us from wasting resources that we are currently wasting for, literally, no reason.\r\n\r\n\tIn master, we are first looping-through the entire wallet's map inside  `AvailableCoins`, which is a resource intensive task if you have a big wallet, just to fail right after it finishes, discarding the coins result, because one of the pre-set inputs has an error.\r\n\r\n3.  If the user disallowed the \"other inputs selection\" by setting `m_allow_other_inputs=false` (which means: “no coins from the AvailableCoins result function will be used during Coin Selection”): \r\n\r\n\tIn master: we loop-through the entire wallet's map inside `AvailableCoins` first, then we discard the computed result (because we will not use it..), then we fetch and use the pre-selected-inputs only.\r\n\tWhich is time and processing power wasted for no reason.\r\n\r\n\tIn this PR: we simply select the preset inputs, skip `AvailableCoins` if `m_allow_other_inputs=false` and provides them to `SelectCoins`.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n> but I think it would be better to just go through SelectCoins and improve its error reporting instead of pulling things out so that errors are reported elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe are currently failing inside the Coin Selection process due:\r\n* “Invalid pre-selected input”\r\n* “Not found pre-selected input”\r\n* “Not solvable pre-selected input”\r\n\r\nThese errors have nothing to do with the Coin Selection process. Why keep them there?\r\n\r\nIt's not that I located these errors on a random place. I placed them inside a \"Fetch Coins\" procedure whose main responsibility is fetch the coins that the user pre-selected and fetch the available coins in the wallet. Which seems totally reasonable for me.\r\n\r\nI mean, this errors have been obscured inside Coin Selection all this time, not being properly notified, because they should had never been placed there in the first place. It's all about a proper responsibility division to make the process clearer and cleaner so it's less error-prone (and in this case, in some occasions, actually faster and less resource consuming).",

The rationale for each modification should be clearer now.\r\n\r\nWhat did was:\r\n\r\n1) Eliminate the pre-set inputs second iteration inside `SelectCoins` by adding an `AddInputs(std::vector<COutput>&)` method to `SelectionResult` (so we don't need to iterate over the inputs just to insert them inside an ephemeral `OutputGroup` whom is simply not used --> `SelectionResult::AddInput(OutputGroup&)` takes directly the `m_outputs` internal field..).\r\n\r\n2) Remove the `FetchCoins` wrapper function and the `CoinsFund` struct:\r\n    Moved the internals to `CreateTransactionInternal`, who will first call `FetchSelectedInputs` then call `AvailableCoins`.\r\n\r\n3)  Decouple the SelectCoins into two functions:\r\n\r\n    * `AutomaticCoinSelection`:\r\nWhich is basically the previously called SelectCoins without the manually selected inputs stuff.\r\nSo, it will purely receive a set of coins and be in charge of selecting the best subset of them to\r\ncover the target amount.\r\n\r\n    * `SelectCoins`:\r\nIn charge of selecting all the user manually selected coins first (\"pre-set inputs\"), and\r\nif coin_control 'm_allow_other_inputs=true', call 'AutomaticCoinSelection' to select a\r\nset of coins such that the target - pre_set_inputs.total_amount is met. Then merge\r\nboth results.\r\n\r\n4) Have set `CoinControl::m_allow_other_inputs` default value to `true` to correct\r\na misleading behavior (convo started [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25685#discussion_r938977841)):\r\n    - As several flows in the wallet such as `sendtoaddress`, `sendmany`\r\nand even the GUI don't change the `m_allow_other_inputs` param,\r\nand the default value for it has been `false`. The process was having \r\na workaround patch to automatically fall back to select coins from the\r\nwallet if `m_allow_other_inputs=false` and no manual inputs were selected.\r\n",

Thus there is no need to remove pre-selected coins from `available_coins` anymore.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I think it would be great to add comments to the functions below to explain that these are user pre-selected coins.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/243d7bde7859777ebe9442477da1b77419bd3f32/src/wallet/coincontrol.h#L66-L74\r\nSame here \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/243d7bde7859777ebe9442477da1b77419bd3f32/src/wallet/coincontrol.h#L135\r\n\r\na53748e3323a33829134cb575830933ac1893323:\r\nI verified `FetchSelectedInputs` is only a wrapping of the pre-selected-inputs lookup from `AvailableCoins` with a better error handler.\r\n\r\ne94e9ce68dc2fdb06a2da17020e067baede72d1e:\r\nI believe this commit makes the Coin Selection flow much easier to read and also avoids iterating over the wallet's tx map, which increases performance.\r\n\r\nnits in commit description:\r\n\"we can fail right away without ~~compute~~ computing the wallet...\"\r\n\"In charge of ~~select~~ selecting all the user manually selected coins...\"\r\n\r\n3e5bfcc75db1f2abf875fbcd1ed68f8166683ea4:\r\nVerified that if there are sufficient funds with the manually selected coins, there is no need to call the automatic coin selection.\r\n\r\nI ran the benchmark both on master and this PR and got similar results as the PR description!\r\nI would agree with @josibake regarding having a benchmark for \"when a user has a few pre-selected inputs and also uses automatic coin selection\" though.",

My hunch is that that is the more representative scenario\r\n\r\nYou know @josibake, I didn't add it here mainly because this PR improves a particular scenario; when the user pre-selected inputs and disallowed the wallet automatic coin selection.\r\nThis PR doesn't improve, at least not directly, the preset inputs + automatic coin selection scenario.\r\n\r\nBut sure, will add another bench case for it :). Was planning to push it on a follow-up work to measure other changes but can sneak it here as well.\r\n\r\n> As a side note, I think it would be great to add comments to the functions below to explain that these are user pre-selected coins.\r\n\r\nAgree @aureleoules, shouldn't be called `setSelected` and have some comments there.

The reason is that `SelectResult` only has a function `AddInputs(OutputGroups)` and not an `AddInputs(set<COutputs>)` nor a merge method.\r\n\r\nSide note, based on a quick code review: the selection result built from the combination of pre-set-inputs and the wallet selected ones should be having an inaccurate waste calculation -- will do some tests in another PR --).",

So.. they are always falling back to select coins from the wallet.\r\n\r\nSo.. if I move this check below, will need to set `m_allow_other_inputs=true` in every caller that does not add any input manually (or.. change the default value to be true inside coin control).\r\n\r\nbut.. let me see if those two RPC commands are the only affected ones. Maybe it's a straightforward change.\r\nI do agree that the current master behavior of automatically falling back to select coins from the wallet even when `m_allow_other_inputs=false` is messy and not an expected behavior.",

We were having a bug/workaround to always select coins automatically from the wallet even when the user explicitly set `add_inputs=false` (which means \"don't select coins automatically\").\r\n\r\nThis is why, even when I changed the field default value inside coin control, I didn't need to change any test on that commit. They actually were all depending on the bug to work properly! (including the GUI..).\r\n\r\nCan try it by setting `add_inputs=false` in any of the fund* RPC commands without pre-setting any input. The process will automatically select coins from the wallet even when you are explicitly blocking it (the proper expected behavior is fail due \"insufficient funds\").\r\nI'm going to add test coverage for this.. so the previous bad behavior and the fix commit can be contrasted. It was a truly misleading behavior.\r\n\r\n~~Side from that:\r\nI know what you mean, if the user pre-set inputs, the previous default value was `false`. So, to not change behavior in this scenario, by default, no automatic coin selection should be performed on the RPC commands.\r\nWill add coverage for this as well.~~. --> not needed since #26053.\r\nThanks.",

Some big issues aren't problems at all in a small scale.\r\n\r\nAs time isn't constant between runs and the difference is so small with 2000 blocks, stuff like this can easily go unnoticed for a really long time. Which kinda break the purpose of having a benchmark for it.\r\n\r\nE.g. lets say that we have this benchmark in the code with the 2000 blocks param. And someone introduces a similar problematic (traverse the whole wallet map and do other stuff for no reason).\r\nWould you care about it if the benchmark returns a time diff between 60-100 ns? or would you just say \"it's ok\"?.\r\nWe could be hurting badly big wallets with our changes without noticing it at all.\r\n\r\nSaying that, will decrease the number to 10k blocks. So we get closer to each other's number. Would you be ok with it?\r\nI think that the 2k blocks number is too small to be helpful on this context.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nAs future thoughts, would be nice to be able to re-use setups in the benchmarks. So every `WalletCreateTx*` would not require to create a new chain per run.\r\nPlus, would be good to not run all the benchmarks by default in `make check`. Only people working in the specific area should run them (or even better, maybe only PRs with certain labels should run them and compare the results with master's result).",

We would be mixing responsibilities if we do that. The `SelectionResult` class is particular to the coin selection process (in the future, it might even be decoupled into a separated library) and `FetchSelectedInputs` is a wallet method that we use to obtain a set of outputs (similar to `AvailableCoins` but instead of traversing the whole wallet tx map, it fetches the specific outputs directly), which could be used in different contexts and not only inside the tx creation process (places where the `SelectionResult` class wouldn't make much sense).\r\n\r\n2. The `SelectionResult` constructor requires a target, which we don’t have up until we fetch and sum-up all the manually selected outputs. So, we would end up doing the same that we do inside `SelectCoins` but inside `FetchSelectedInputs`: (1) first fetch and store all the outputs in a vector, then at the end of the method, create a `SelectionResult` with the accurate target and return it (so there would really be no difference with the current approach unless we add another constructor and a new `AddInput` method inside `SelectionResult` that keeps track of target etc or.. pass the tx target to `FetchSelectedInputs` which I think that is ugly as the tx target has nothing to do with a fetching-only function). \r\n3. Plus, the new struct caches the total amount and contemplates the effective/raw amount distinction. Which, for example, made #26203 issue a non-issue here.\r\n.\r\n\r\nWith this I’m not saying that we should marry to this struct (we could also use `CoinsResult` instead) but I don’t think that changing it to `SelectionResult` will make the code better (at least for now). It would probably just continue entangling the coin selection code inside wallet general functions that we should be able to re-use in other processes.\r\n\r\nPlus, after the next PR in the line #25806, I think that this process will be in a much better shape to re-do this convo once more. Mainly because the coin selection process will not be so attached to the wallet internals. So, we might be able to decouple it into a different module or an external library.",
