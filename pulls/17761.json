    "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nIt is known that Bitcoin miners could be a problem in the near future (what if a miner can mine more than 50% of transactions? what about electricity waste caused by mining?...).\r\n\r\nTo avoid that, why do not remove all transaction fees and in exchange, the bitcoin sender must perform some mining every time they make a bitcoin transaction? this way, the sender will act as a miner for a few transactions of others. The system will be self-regulated: the more transactions are in the system, the more miners there will be available.\r\n\r\nNowadays, there are javascript libraries doing that for miners, so when you enter in a website you are mining for others, many times illegally because they do not warn you. Why do not include that in the core of Bitcoin? That way:\r\n\r\n- Fees would be removed and any transaction would be completely free\r\n- Electricity waste caused by mining would be dramatically reduced\r\n- The system would be self-regulated regarding to mining tasks\r\n- Senders would know they have to perform some mining\r\n- Mining tasks would be re-distributed instead of centralized as it is happening now (miners are concentrated where electricity and technology are cheaper)\r\n\r\nHope this help and thank you very much for your great effort!\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\nNote: apologize if this is not the right place to share my thoughts :)",

Coverage here is a prerequisite before deprecating the `label` response or adding multiple labels per address.\n  - `bitcoin-cli help getaddressinfo` returns a few content errors, difficult-to-read formatting, and no explanation why it returns both `label` and `labels` and how they relate, which can be confusing for application developers.\n\n  Changes by order of commits:\n  - [x] improve/fix getaddressinfo RPCHelpman layout formatting\n  - [x] improve/fix getaddressinfo RPCHelpman content\n  - [x] clarify the `label` and `labels` fields in getaddressinfo RPCHelpman\n  - [x] update getaddressinfo RPCExamples addresses to bech32\n  - [x] add getaddressinfo code docs\n  - [x] add a `listlabels` test assertion in wallet_labels.py\n  - [x] add missing getaddressinfo `labels` test coverage and improve the existing `label` tests\n\n  Here are gists of the CLI help output:\n  [`bitcoin-cli help getaddressinfo` before this PR](https://gist.github.com/jonatack/022af5221a85c069780359a22643c810)\n  [`bitcoin-cli help getaddressinfo` after this PR](https://gist.github.com/jonatack/4ee5f6abc62a3d99269570206a5f90ba)\n\n  It seems we ought to begin a deprecation process for the getaddressinfo `label` field? If yes, I have a follow-up ready. _--> EDIT: Deprecation follow-ups #17578 and #17585 now build on this PR._\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  fjahr:\n    Re-ACK 33f5fc32e5bfbe1e89c4d20ce455bcc6dc194151\n  jnewbery:\n    ACK 33f5fc32e5bfbe1e89c4d20ce455bcc6dc194151.\n\nTree-SHA512: a001aa863090ec2566a31059477945b1c303ebeb430b33472f8b150e420fa5742fc33bca9d95571746395b607f43f6078dd5b53e238ac1f3fc648b51c8f79a07\n",

Coverage here is a prerequisite before deprecating the `label` response or adding multiple labels per address.\n  - `bitcoin-cli help getaddressinfo` returns a few content errors, difficult-to-read formatting, and no explanation why it returns both `label` and `labels` and how they relate, which can be confusing for application developers.\n\n  Changes by order of commits:\n  - [x] improve/fix getaddressinfo RPCHelpman layout formatting\n  - [x] improve/fix getaddressinfo RPCHelpman content\n  - [x] clarify the `label` and `labels` fields in getaddressinfo RPCHelpman\n  - [x] update getaddressinfo RPCExamples addresses to bech32\n  - [x] add getaddressinfo code docs\n  - [x] add a `listlabels` test assertion in wallet_labels.py\n  - [x] add missing getaddressinfo `labels` test coverage and improve the existing `label` tests\n\n  Here are gists of the CLI help output:\n  [`bitcoin-cli help getaddressinfo` before this PR](https://gist.github.com/jonatack/022af5221a85c069780359a22643c810)\n  [`bitcoin-cli help getaddressinfo` after this PR](https://gist.github.com/jonatack/4ee5f6abc62a3d99269570206a5f90ba)\n\n  It seems we ought to begin a deprecation process for the getaddressinfo `label` field? If yes, I have a follow-up ready. _--> EDIT: Deprecation follow-ups #17578 and #17585 now build on this PR._\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  fjahr:\n    Re-ACK 33f5fc32e5bfbe1e89c4d20ce455bcc6dc194151\n  jnewbery:\n    ACK 33f5fc32e5bfbe1e89c4d20ce455bcc6dc194151.\n\nTree-SHA512: a001aa863090ec2566a31059477945b1c303ebeb430b33472f8b150e420fa5742fc33bca9d95571746395b607f43f6078dd5b53e238ac1f3fc648b51c8f79a07",

Or at least not one that would be triggered by running the functional tests! :)\n\n  My hope is that this addition will make it super-easy to run the functional tests under Valgrind and thus increase the probability of people making use of it :)\n\n  Hopefully `test/functional/test_runner.py --valgrind` will become a natural part of the pre-release QA process.\n\n  **Usage:**\n\n  ```\n  $ test/functional/test_runner.py --help\n  …\n    --valgrind            run nodes under the valgrind memory error detector:\n                          expect at least a ~10x slowdown, valgrind 3.14 or\n                          later required\n  ```\n\n  **Live demo:**\n\n  First, let's re-introduce a memory bug by reverting the recent P2P uninitialized read bug fix from PR #17624 (\"net: Fix an uninitialized read in ProcessMessage(…, \"tx\", …) when receiving a transaction we already have\").\n\n  ```\n  $ git diff\n  diff --git a/src/consensus/validation.h b/src/consensus/validation.h\n  index 3401eb64c..940adea33 100644\n  --- a/src/consensus/validation.h\n  +++ b/src/consensus/validation.h\n  @@ -114,7 +114,7 @@ inline ValidationState::~ValidationState() {};\n\n   class TxValidationState : public ValidationState {\n   private:\n  -    TxValidationResult m_result = TxValidationResult::TX_RESULT_UNSET;\n  +    TxValidationResult m_result;\n   public:\n       bool Invalid(TxValidationResult result,\n                    const std::string &reject_reason=\"\",\n  ```\n\n  Second, let's test as normal without Valgrind:\n\n  ```\n  $ test/functional/p2p_segwit.py -l INFO\n  2019-11-28T09:30:42.810000Z TestFramework (INFO): Initializing test directory /tmp/bitcoin_func_test__fc8q3qo\n  …\n  2019-11-28T09:31:57.187000Z TestFramework (INFO): Subtest: test_non_standard_witness_blinding (Segwit active = True)\n  …\n  2019-11-28T09:32:08.265000Z TestFramework (INFO): Tests successful\n  ```\n\n  Third, let's test with `--valgrind` and see if the test fail (as we expect) when the unitialized value is used:\n\n  ```\n  $ test/functional/p2p_segwit.py -l INFO --valgrind\n  2019-11-28T09:32:33.018000Z TestFramework (INFO): Initializing test directory /tmp/bitcoin_func_test_gtjecx2l\n  …\n  2019-11-28T09:40:36.702000Z TestFramework (INFO): Subtest: test_non_standard_witness_blinding (Segwit active = True)\n  2019-11-28T09:40:37.813000Z TestFramework (ERROR): Assertion failed\n  ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused\n  ```\n\nACKs for top commit:\n  MarcoFalke:\n    ACK 5db506ba5943868cc2c845f717508739b7f05714\n  jonatack:\n    ACK 5db506ba5943868cc2c845f717508739b7f05714\n\nTree-SHA512: 2eaecacf4da166febad88b2a8ee6d7ac2bcd38d4c1892ca39516b6343e8f8c8814edf5eaf14c90f11a069a0389d24f0713076112ac284de987e72fc5f6cc3795",

(Aaron Clauson)\n\nPull request description:\n\n  As discussed in #17594 this PR contains a GitHub Action workflow file that performs the same job as the current Appveyor CI task except for the Python functional tests. For the latter I've been unable to get them to execute successfully due to a Unicode error. I've tried on and off for a week to get it to work but with no joy.\n\n  It may be that someone more proficient in Python will recognise the error and be able to provide a pointer on how to proceed. I've tried some obvious things like changing the Windows console code page.\n\n  To run this job it should just be a matter of clicking on the GitHub `Actions` tab and enabling workflows. It's also not required that the file is on the `master` branch for the job to run. If anyone else wants to run the job they can pull this PR into their own fork and enable `Actions` (it's free).\n\nTop commit has no ACKs.\n\nTree-SHA512: 8dce7509922ece3438b15ea371ec509a08b507e981a8fb705f1cf5a2b4a147a22ded599942aa95f3bd8d5e98cfc65b50cf3df6171f02dd863659160f1d77ef76\n",

(Aaron Clauson)\n\nPull request description:\n\n  As discussed in #17594 this PR contains a GitHub Action workflow file that performs the same job as the current Appveyor CI task except for the Python functional tests. For the latter I've been unable to get them to execute successfully due to a Unicode error. I've tried on and off for a week to get it to work but with no joy.\n\n  It may be that someone more proficient in Python will recognise the error and be able to provide a pointer on how to proceed. I've tried some obvious things like changing the Windows console code page.\n\n  To run this job it should just be a matter of clicking on the GitHub `Actions` tab and enabling workflows. It's also not required that the file is on the `master` branch for the job to run. If anyone else wants to run the job they can pull this PR into their own fork and enable `Actions` (it's free).\n\nTop commit has no ACKs.\n\nTree-SHA512: 8dce7509922ece3438b15ea371ec509a08b507e981a8fb705f1cf5a2b4a147a22ded599942aa95f3bd8d5e98cfc65b50cf3df6171f02dd863659160f1d77ef76",

`ParseScript(...)`, various number parsing functions and various JSON/univalue parsing functions.\n\n  **Testing this PR**\n  As usual the best way to test proposed fuzzing harnesses is to use `test_fuzzing_harnesses.sh` (#17000) to quickly verify that the relevant code regions are triggered, that the fuzzing throughput seems reasonable, etc.\n\n  `test_fuzzing_harnesses.sh 'psbt|hd_keypath|numbers|parse_script|univalue' 10` runs all fuzzers matching the regexp and gives them ten seconds of runtime each.\n\n  ```\n  $ CC=clang CXX=clang++ ./configure --enable-fuzz

This PR adds an ignore rule for the warning (it's related to the nodiscard attribute and is not considered relevant).\n\n  An additional side effect of the msvc compiler update is the prebuilt Qt5.9.8 libraries cannot be linked due to being built with an earlier version of the compiler. To fix this a new Qt5.9.8 version has been compiled and the appveyor job updated to use them.\n\n  The GitHub Actions job needs to continue to use the original Qt5.9.8 libraries until the latest GitHub Windows image also updates to >= Visual Studio 2019 v16.4.\n\nTop commit has no ACKs.\n\nTree-SHA512: c28d64d78a968eb0bd614932b2d42d762d68853120c345970072b473e2c43fb34e99865062ae1517b10e76f269de6b8f4eed119cf05d59aa883a3553d6a76812",

RPC Whitelists help enforce application policies for services being built on top of Bitcoin Core (e.g., your Lightning Node maybe shouldn't be adding new peers).

If rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 1 and no rpcwhitelist is set, act as if all users are subject to whitelists.\n\n  Review Request\n  =====\n  In addition to normal review, would love specific review from someone working on LN (e.g., @ roasbeef) and someone working on an infrastructure team at an exchange (e.g., @ jimpo) to check that this works well with their system.\n\n  Notes\n  =====\n\n  The rpc list is spelling sensitive -- whitespace is stripped though. Spelling errors fail towards the RPC call being blocked, which is safer.\n\n  It was unclear to me if HTTPReq_JSONRPC is the best function to patch this functionality into, or if it would be better to place it in exec or somewhere else.\n\n  It was also unclear to me if it would be preferred to cache the whitelists on startup or parse them on every RPC as is done with multiUserAuthorized.
