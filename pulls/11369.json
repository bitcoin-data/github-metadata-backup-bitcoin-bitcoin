    "body": "Currently only a tiny fraction of all `LOCK(...)`:s are documented with information on why each lock is held.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of such comments it can sometimes be hard to see why a specific lock is held from merely reading the code. This risks leading to situations where redundant `LOCK(...)`:s are kept by mistake or \"just to be safe\" after refactoring, etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the situation by adding comments with information on why a specific lock is being held by adding a comment using the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLOCK(cs_lockName); // variableBeingGuardedByThisLock, FunctionRequiringHoldingThisLock(...)\r\n…\r\nvariableBeingGuardedByThisLock += 1;\r\n…\r\nFunctionRequiringHoldingThisLock(someThing);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this patch there were 9 documented and 514 undocumented `LOCK`/`LOCK2`:s –\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep -E \"[^a-zA-Z_](LOCK|LOCK2)\\(\" -- \"*.h\" \"*.cpp\" | grep -v sync.h | grep \"//\" | wc -l\r\n9\r\n$ git grep -E \"[^a-zA-Z_](LOCK|LOCK2)\\(\" -- \"*.h\" \"*.cpp\" | grep -v sync.h | grep -v \"//\" | wc -l\r\n514\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this patch there are 405 documented and 118 undocumented `LOCK`/`LOCK2`:s – \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep -E \"[^a-zA-Z_](LOCK|LOCK2)\\(\" -- \"*.h\" \"*.cpp\" | grep -v sync.h | grep \"//\" | wc -l\r\n405\r\n$ git grep -E \"[^a-zA-Z_](LOCK|LOCK2)\\(\" -- \"*.h\" \"*.cpp\" | grep -v sync.h | grep -v \"//\" | wc -l\r\n118\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that there are still some locks left that are undocumented. I need help identifying the variable that is ultimately being guarded by each of these locks (it could be that some of these locks are unnecessary - if so, let me know!).\r\n\r\nPlease help by browsing the remaining undocumented locks using ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep -3 -n -E '^[^/#]*[^A-Z_](LOCK|LOCK2)\\([^/]*$' -- \"*.cpp\" \"*.h\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n... and see if you can help bring clarity. Each undocumented guarded variable that can be identified helps a lot - just leave a comment on the missing lock/guarded variable pair you've found and I'll track down all instances of that combination and add the appropriate comments :-)\r\n\r\nThat will be of great help for this comment PR and also for the related thread-safety annotations PR that I'm working on (see #11226).",
