I mean it _seem_ like something people would want to commonly do.\r\n\r\nEasy fuzzing of networking code is unfortunately an unsolved problem generally AFAIK.\r\n\r\nThere have been many attempts to solve this by using `LD_PRELOAD` hacks as @vasild mentions. One notable example is [`preeny`'s `desock`](https://github.com/zardus/preeny). My experience is that these `LD_PRELOAD` hacks are pretty fragile and while they might be good enough for short-term one-off fuzzing jobs (think targeted vulnerability research) they are not suitable for more long-term robustness testing needs like in our case.\r\n\r\nThe best \"off the shelf\" solution to this problem I've seen is what Honggfuzz is doing with its networking mode `libhfnetdriver` (see http://blog.swiecki.net/2018/01/fuzzing-tcp-servers.html). Unfortunately that solutions is limited to Honggfuzz and it is more suited for \"macro level\" networking code fuzzing than the more \"micro level\" networking code fuzzing this PR targets.\r\n\r\nThat said: Honggfuzz NetDriver is great too have in the toolbox too: I've tried documenting how to fuzz Bitcoin Core using Honggfuzz's networking mode. See the unmerged PR #20380 (\"doc: Add instructions on how to fuzz the P2P layer using Honggfuzz NetDriver\"). Review welcome! :)\r\n\r\ntl;dr -- Mocked networking functions driven by `FuzzedDataProvider` as suggested in this PR is AFAICT the most robust and appropriate way to solve our low-level network fuzzing needs. That said it would be interesting to know if anyone has any alternative approach which is both robust and fuzzer engine agnostic: automated robustness testing of networking code is an active area of research :)\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> tl;dr -- Mocked networking functions driven by FuzzedDataProvider as suggested in this PR is AFAICT the most robust and appropriate way to solve our low-level network fuzzing needs.\r\n\r\nSure. Fair enough. It's just that I'm in principle not a fan of wrapping and abstracting basic operating system APIs such as BSD Sockets because anyone contributing to the code has to learn a special interface instead of being up to speed quickly with what they already know. It's also another moving part that could have bugs itself.\r\n\r\nThat said, it seems this is useful for other things such as I2P support so that seems enough of a motivation to do it anyway. If we do it, it would be good to do so at a global level as #20788 does.",

Maybe change this to a few 100s of ms to make a timeout more likely?",

That environment is not assumed to be set except in special circumstances such as when targeted fuzzing is performed by security researchers and others who are willing to pay the 2 ms cost in order to get full coverage including the timeout logic.\r\n\r\nMaking the sleeping required to trigger the timeout mockable is likely out of scope for this PR (but would be nice to have!), so if the opt-in-to-timeout-via-`FUZZED_SOCKET_FAKE_LATENCY` workaround is deemed too ugly I could simply drop that commit from this PR, and we'll get partial instead of full coverage :)\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and I'll adjust accordingly :)",

In other words: a single byte input chooses between the \"fail path\" and the \"success path\" via `ConsumeBool`.\r\n\r\nAfter some tinkering/measuring it seems like that effort to help the fuzzer didn't make any significant difference.\r\n\r\nNow skipping the `ConsumeBool(…) ? len : ConsumeIntegralInRange(…)` in favor of a straight `ConsumeIntegralInRange(…)` as suggested.
