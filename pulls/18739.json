(The only thing that has changed on our side is a recent switch to C++17 for the fuzzers, but I assume that is unrelated.)\r\n\r\nThe error message reported is `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput():38 Define 'int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(uint8_t * buf, size_t len)' in your code to make it work`, but [we do define `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/54f812d9d29893c690ae06b84aaeab128186aa36/src/test/fuzz/fuzz.cpp#L34-L47) (and `libFuzzer` works as expected).\r\n\r\nI assume our quick start instructions are incorrect in some way: are we missing something obvious here? :)",
