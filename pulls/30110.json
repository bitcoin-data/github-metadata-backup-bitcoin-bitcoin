    "body": "Part of #27463.\r\n\r\nThis PR does 2 things:\r\n\r\n(1) It modularizes transaction download logic into a `TxDownloadManager`. Transaction download logic refers to the process of deciding what transactions to request, download, and validate.[1] There should be no behavior changes. Using `--color_moved=dimmed_zebra -w` may help.\r\n(2) It adds unit and fuzz (:magic_wand:) testing for transaction download.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits to this interface, such as:\r\n- Unit test coverage and fuzzing for logic that currently isn't feasible to test as thoroughly (without lots of overhead) and/or currently only lightly tested through `assert_debug_log` (not good) in functional tests.\r\n- When we add more functionality (e.g. package relay messages, more robust orphan handling), the vast majority of it will be within `TxDownloadManager` instead of `PeerManager`, making it easier to review and test. See #28031 for what this looks like.\r\n- `PeerManager` will no longer know anything about / have access to `TxOrphanage`, `TxRequestTracker` or the rejection caches. Its primary interface with `TxDownloadManager` would be much simpler:\r\n    - Passing on  `ValidationInterface` callbacks\r\n    - Telling `txdownloadman` when a peer {connects, disconnects}\r\n    - Telling `txdownloadman`when a {transaction, package} is {accepted, rejected} from mempool\r\n    - Telling `txdownloadman` when invs, notfounds, and txs are received.\r\n    - Getting instructions on what to download.\r\n    - Getting instructions on what {transactions, packages, orphans} to validate.\r\n    - Get whether a peer `HaveMoreWork` for the `ProessMessages` loop\r\n- (todo) Thread-safety can be handled internally.\r\n\r\n[1]: This module is concerned with tx *download*, not upload. It excludes transaction announcements/gossip which happens after we download/accept a transaction. Txreconciliation (erlay) is excluded from this module, as it only relates to deciding which `inv`s to send or helping the other peer decide which `inv`s to send. It is independent from this logic.",

It would of course be sad if we split them out and then only the refactoring lands (which has happened before).\r\n\r\nIf people like the fuzz tests (concept acks would be nice), I'll split them off to make this PR smaller, and keep the unit tests in here. I just don't want to create 2 big PRs that nobody is interested in.",

For example, `TxDownloadOptions` could be extended to hold a lambda that returns the latest tip hash, which in production simply fetches the hash from the `ChainstateManager` (and for tests it can be mocked). This might be easier to review since it preserves the previous mechanism? Although perhaps also more difficult w.r.t to lock inversion of `cs_main` and `m_tx_download_mutex`.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be to directly pass the current block hash as a param into the relevant `TxDownloadManager` methods.",
