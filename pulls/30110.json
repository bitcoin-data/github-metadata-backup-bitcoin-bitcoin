    "body": "Part of #27463.\r\n\r\nThis PR does 2 things:\r\n\r\n(1) It modularizes transaction download logic into a `TxDownloadManager`. Transaction download logic refers to the process of deciding what transactions to request, download, and validate.[1] All of the changes here should result in no behavior change, and `--color_moved=dimmed_zebra` should help.\r\n(2) It adds unit and fuzz (:magic_wand:) testing for transaction download.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits to this interface, such as:\r\n- Unit test coverage and **F U Z Z I N G** for logic that currently isn't feasible to test as thoroughly (due to the code paths not being reachable through `PeerManager` without a ton of overhead) and/or currently only lightly tested through `assert_debug_log` ( :-1: ) in functional tests.\r\n- When we add more functionality (e.g. package relay messages, more robust orphan handling), the vast majority of it will be within `TxDownloadManager` instead of `PeerManager`, making it easier to review and test.\r\n- `PeerManager` will no longer know anything about / have access to `TxOrphanage` or rejection caches. Its primary interface with `TxDownloadManager` would be:\r\n    - Notify `txdownloadman` of tip changes (i.e. passing on some `ValidationInterface` callbacks)\r\n    - Tell `txdownloadman`when a {transaction, package} is {accepted, rejected} from mempool, and receive a few instructions\r\n    - Each time a peer {connects, disconnects}. And a sanity check function when cleaning up i.e. all disconnected\r\n    - Pass transaction `inv`s, `notfound`s, and `tx`s and receive instructions on what packages or transactions to validate\r\n    - Get the `getdata` requests to send\r\n    - Get the transactions to reconsider in `ProcessOrphanTx`\r\n    - Get whether a peer `HaveMoreWork` for the `ProessMessages` loop\r\n    - ^in the future, it would also pass package-related messages on, and we would reuse the `PackageToValidate` struct to return the things `peerman` needs for validation.\r\n- (todo) with some more interface changes, we can make this manager internally thread-safe so that `PeerManager` doesn't need to think about locking `m_tx_download_mutex`\r\n\r\n[1]: This module is concerned with tx *download*, not upload. It excludes transaction announcements/gossip which happens after we download/accept a transaction. Txreconciliation (erlay) is excluded from this module, as it only relates to deciding which `inv`s to send or helping the other peer decide which `inv`s to send. It is independent from this logic.",

For example, `TxDownloadOptions` could be extended to hold a lambda that returns the latest tip hash, which in production simply fetches the hash from the `ChainstateManager` (and for tests it can be mocked). This might be easier to review since it preserves the previous mechanism? Although perhaps also more difficult w.r.t to lock inversion of `cs_main` and `m_tx_download_mutex`.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be to directly pass the current block hash as a param into the relevant `TxDownloadManager` methods.",
