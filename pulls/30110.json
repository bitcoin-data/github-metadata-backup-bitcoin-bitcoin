    "body": "Part of #27463.\r\n\r\nThis PR does 2 things:\r\n\r\n(1) It modularizes transaction download logic into a `TxDownloadManager`. Transaction download logic refers to the process of deciding what transactions to request, download, and validate.[1] There should be no behavior changes. Using `--color_moved=dimmed_zebra -w` may help.\r\n(2) It adds unit and fuzz (:magic_wand:) testing for transaction download.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits to this interface, such as:\r\n- Unit test coverage and fuzzing for logic that currently isn't feasible to test as thoroughly (without lots of overhead) and/or currently only lightly tested through `assert_debug_log` (not good) in functional tests.\r\n- When we add more functionality (e.g. package relay messages, more robust orphan handling), the vast majority of it will be within `TxDownloadManager` instead of `PeerManager`, making it easier to review and test. See #28031 for what this looks like.\r\n- `PeerManager` will no longer know anything about / have access to `TxOrphanage`, `TxRequestTracker` or the rejection caches. Its primary interface with `TxDownloadManager` would be much simpler:\r\n    - Passing on  `ValidationInterface` callbacks\r\n    - Telling `txdownloadman` when a peer {connects, disconnects}\r\n    - Telling `txdownloadman`when a {transaction, package} is {accepted, rejected} from mempool\r\n    - Telling `txdownloadman` when invs, notfounds, and txs are received.\r\n    - Getting instructions on what to download.\r\n    - Getting instructions on what {transactions, packages, orphans} to validate.\r\n    - Get whether a peer `HaveMoreWork` for the `ProessMessages` loop\r\n- (todo) Thread-safety can be handled internally.\r\n\r\n[1]: This module is concerned with tx *download*, not upload. It excludes transaction announcements/gossip which happens after we download/accept a transaction. Txreconciliation (erlay) is excluded from this module, as it only relates to deciding which `inv`s to send or helping the other peer decide which `inv`s to send. It is independent from this logic.",

It would make the first PR less exciting to review, but perhaps easier to review?\r\n\r\nUp to you, but there is a small benefit of going with the fuzz tests first (if possible), in that they first run on master (and pass), and then on the refactor changes (and pass as well). For unit tests this can be achieved by just putting them in an early commit and then running the tests for all commits. For fuzz tests, it is a bit more difficult, because fuzz inputs need to exist. (Also, some fuzz task sanitizers are only run in external CI, because they take a long time)",

      "body": "ok I reviewed the unit and fuzz tests.\r\n\r\nFor the tx_download fuzz target there's a couple issues:\r\n\r\n1) the time could adversarially be moved forward only 1ms at a time, 100k iterations results in 100 seconds. I hacked the target to *only* allow the forced good peer to respond to the getdata. I got a case where the while loop exits when only 100 seconds have passed in simulated time. Stalling peer A refuses to send TX, then after 60 seconds, at the same time, an honest peer and stalling peer connect and offer the same INV. First INV times out, then second stalling peer gets chosen as next CANIDATE_BEST. Runs out of iterations 40 seconds later.\r\n\r\n2) More annoyingly, the case I found had instability. I *think* it's because TxRequests' `PriorityComputer` is not being set to deterministic random even when TxDownloadMan is. So sometimes the case was passing due to the ordering of the candidates based on this randomness.\r\n\r\nIn general I think this last fuzz target should try to target more on the end of \"only one good peer\", at least switch to that with a bool, since I think when allowing all peers to perhaps be somewhat good, it hides potential issues.",

For example, `TxDownloadOptions` could be extended to hold a lambda that returns the latest tip hash, which in production simply fetches the hash from the `ChainstateManager` (and for tests it can be mocked). This might be easier to review since it preserves the previous mechanism? Although perhaps also more difficult w.r.t to lock inversion of `cs_main` and `m_tx_download_mutex`.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be to directly pass the current block hash as a param into the relevant `TxDownloadManager` methods.",

But we also know from experience debugging fuzzers that sometimes the random outpoint's txid matches the hash of one of the transactions, which is annoying because it creates \"direct relationships\".\r\n\r\nIronically, since prevouts reference hashes, the easiest way to ensure transactions aren't directly related is to have them all be indirectly related.\r\n\r\nSo my quick and dirty method for creating n transactions is to generate 1 utxo and make 2*n transactions chaining off of it, then use every other tx. I don't need to know n ahead of time - I just make 2 at the bottom whenever I need one. They're guaranteed to be unique (because sha256) and to not look like they're spending each other (because sha256).",
