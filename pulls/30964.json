    "body": "One of the current RBF acceptance criteria is the prohibition of new unconfirmed inputs in the replacement transaction. That means that all replacement inputs must either be confirmed, or have unconfirmed spends that would get evicted.\r\n\r\nHowever, that limitation is trivially circumvented. If one wanted to spend an unconfirmed UTXO in the replacement transaction, all one would need to do is create a temporary, independent low-fee-rate transaction that spends that input, and then simply add that transaction to the replacement's eviction set. @glozow has documented that [here](https://gist.github.com/glozow/25d9662c52453bd08b4b4b1d3783b9ff) back in early 2022, and I imagine there's other literature out there documenting this same phenomenon.\r\n\r\nOne interesting thing to note with this approach of circumventing rule 2 is that the broadcasting of the temporary transaction and the broadcasting of the actually intended replacement transaction ought to be staggered, lest some nodes see only the final replacement transaction and reject it. I think it's fair to say that that makes the propagation somewhat nondeterministic. Given that any motivated actor can trivially craft such a dummy transaction and then simply wait 30 seconds (maybe less?) before broadcasting the replacement, removing the pretense of rule 2 would reduce network traffic for this scenario.\r\n\r\nIn light of all the work on the cluster mempool that's been ongoing recently, a question for this PR might be: \"why now?\" My answer would be that due to the easy circumvention of rule 2, and it therefore arguably not being a \"real\" rule, removing it is somewhat independent of future, even near-term, mempool policy improvements.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, the basis of this PR might be due to a glaring misunderstanding on my part of how bitcoin works, in which case feel free to close it, and my apologies for the noise.",

      "body": "You're right that rule 2 is broken.  The issue is that our replacement rules are broken in many ways, and if we simply remove rule 2, the result would also be broken.  The motivation for rule 2 was the idea that by introducing a new unconfirmed parent, the effective feerate at which the replacement transaction being validated would be mined might be much lower than the transactions it is evicting (say, if the new unconfirmed parent had a very low feerate).  So by simply removing the rule, I think we'd be exacerbating the incentive compatibility problems that exist with the current set of rules, by making it easier for a transaction with low mining score to evict transactions with high mining scores.\r\n\r\nMy view is that we should indeed scrap these broken rules, but we should do so in conjunction with fixing the fundamental issues.  The cluster mempool proposal is designed to make it so that whenever a replacement happens, the result will always be that the mempool is \"better\" (higher feerate at every size, taking CPFP-effects into account).  If there is another proposal for fixing our RBF rules in a comprehensive way so they are not so broken, then that would be great to evaluate, but I don't think it makes sense to pursue one-off changes that aren't trying to improve the underlying situation.",

      "body": "@instagibbs Sure, I'd agree with that.  \r\n\r\nAnother way to think about it: let's say we scrapped rule 2 as proposed here. The resulting set of rules would have their own logical inconsistencies, specifically rule 6:\r\n> The replacement transaction's feerate is greater than the feerates of all directly conflicting transactions.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, a large transaction that had lower feerate than one of its direct conflicts could be split into two -- a parent with super low feerate, and a child with a sufficiently larger feerate -- and then the transaction could be accepted.\r\n\r\nSo at that point, by the same logic, someone might propose that we just scrap rule 6 too.  Yet rule 6 is at the heart of what we're actually trying to accomplish, and so even if it's broken I don't think we should scrap it either, until we have a better system that we can move to.",

I think reason (2) is actually much more important and complicated. I'm not convinced that the removal would be an improvement, or that any hotfix (like the ancestor score rule added in #23121) would be much better.",

But this is a logical consequence of the overall system being incoherent.  So rather than ask the question, \"can we remove rule X because it doesn't do its job anyway\", I think we should instead ask \"what should the full set of replacement rules be\"?  (And I think the most satisfactory answer to that question at the moment is the feerate-diagram-comparison that is proposed as part of #28676.)\r\n\r\n> But one thing I'd be curious to hear some thoughts on is specifically the potential mempool bifurcation that circumventing rule 2 would create (taking into account that there obviously isn't such a thing as \"the mempool\").\r\n\r\nNot sure exactly what your question here is.  I don't think having network mempools be out of sync is a good thing, but I think of it as a second order effect compared to the replacement rules themselves being bad.\r\n\r\n",

Be it a holistic upgrade as what could be achieved in the future e.g cluster mempool or replace-by-feerate with partial overlap in the effects on guaranteeing high-fee block templates lingering in the network mempools. On that regard, see the “[On mempool policy consistency](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021116.html)” email thread from few years ago that I think is still relevant.\r\n\r\n> Not sure exactly what your question here is. I don't think having network mempools be out of sync is a good thing, but I think of it as a second order effect compared to the replacement rules themselves being bad.\r\n\r\nMore generally, I think the mere problem is transaction (or chain of transactions) acceptance, i.e “is processing this new by identifier transaction bumping the block template fees reward lingering in network mempools ?”, of which best fee replacement is only a subsidiary question, among others of the range like witness malleability (e.g `MINIMALIF`).\r\n\r\nSo yes I think too network mempools being out of syncs is not usually a good thing, though it’s a second order effect that can have its roots in other transaction acceptance checks that replacement only.",

This loophole allows fee-rates to be decreased, which would allow an infinite replacement cycle.\r\n\r\nTransactions violating this new multiple conflicts rule are very rare, less than once a day during the past few months. So I don't think banning them is a problem for Libre Relay. You might want to review my fix and consider if it's worth adding to Bitcoin Core too.",
