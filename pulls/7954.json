    "body": "addresses #7394 and some of #7902\n\nDisabling warnings can be tricky, because doing so can cause a different\ncompiler to create new warnings about unsupported disable flags. Also, some\nwarnings don't surface until they're paired with another warning (gcc). For\nexample, adding \"-Wno-foo\" won't cause any trouble, but if there's a legitimate\nwarning emitted, the \"unknown option -Wno-foo\" will show up as well.\n\nWork around this in 2 ways:\n1. When checking to see if -Wno-foo is supported, check for \"-Wfoo\" instead.\n2. Enable -Werror while checking 1.\n\nIf \"-Werror -Wfoo\" compiles, \"-Wno-foo\" is almost guaranteed to be supported.\n\n-Werror itself is also checked. If that fails to compile by itself, it likely\nmeans that the user added a flag that adds a warning. In that case, -Werror\nwon't be used while checking, and the build may be extra noisy. The user would\nneed to fix the bad input flag.\n\nAlso, silence 2 more additional warnings that can show up post-c++11.\n",

      "message": "build: quiet annoying warnings without adding new ones\n\nDisabling warnings can be tricky, because doing so can cause a different\ncompiler to create new warnings about unsupported disable flags. Also, some\nwarnings don't surface until they're paired with another warning (gcc). For\nexample, adding \"-Wno-foo\" won't cause any trouble, but if there's a legitimate\nwarning emitted, the \"unknown option -Wno-foo\" will show up as well.\n\nWork around this in 2 ways:\n\n1. When checking to see if -Wno-foo is supported, check for \"-Wfoo\" instead.\n2. Enable -Werror while checking 1.\n\nIf \"-Werror -Wfoo\" compiles, \"-Wno-foo\" is almost guaranteed to be supported.\n\n-Werror itself is also checked. If that fails to compile by itself, it likely\nmeans that the user added a flag that adds a warning. In that case, -Werror\nwon't be used while checking, and the build may be extra noisy. The user would\nneed to fix the bad input flag.\n\nAlso, silence 2 more additional warnings that can show up post-c++11.",
