However It does not appear to impact security.\r\n\r\nsrc/arith_uint256.cpp: base_uint<BITS>::bits()​: Line 177\r\n```\r\nfor (int bits = 31; bits > 0; bits--) {\r\n    if (pn[pos] & 1 << bits)\r\n    return 32 * pos + bits + 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n``pn[]`` is ``uint32_t``. ``bits`` is an integer (loop variable). ``1 << bits`` is a signed number (i.e. ``1``) shifted by 31 bits, which is undefined behaviour, because ``1 << 31`` = 2​<sup>31</sup>. ​However, a signed 32-bit number can only represent a number in the range -2<sup>31</sup>​ to 2<sup>​31</sup>​ - 1.\r\n\r\nRemediation\r\n\r\nSuggest the following code:\r\n```\r\nfor (​size_t​ bits = 31; bits > 0; bits--) {   \r\n    if (pn[pos] & ​1U​ << bits)\r\n    return 32 * pos + bits + 1;\r\n}\r\n```",
