    "body": "Currently when we load a wallet, we just iterate through all of the records in the database and add them completely statelessly. However we have some records which do rely on other records being loaded before they are. To deal with this, we use `CWalletScanState` to hold things temporarily until all of the records have been read and then we load the stateful things.\r\n\r\nHowever this can be slow, and with some future improvements, can cause some pretty drastic slowdowns to retain this pattern. So this PR changes the way we load records by choosing to load the records in a particular order. This lets us do things such as loading a descriptor record, then finding and loading that descriptor's cache and key records. In the future, this will also let us use `IsMine` when loading transactions as then `IsMine` will actually be working as we now always load keys and descriptors before transactions.\r\n\r\nIn order to get records of a specific type, this PR includes some refactors to how we do database cursors. Functionality is also added to retrieve a cursor that will give us records beginning with a specified prefix.\r\n\r\nLastly, one thing that iterating the entire database let us do was to find unknown records. However even if unknown records were found, we would not do anything with this information except output a number in a log line. With this PR, we would no longer be aware of any unknown records. This does not change functionality as we don't do anything with unknown records, and having unknown records is not an error. Now we would just not be aware that unknown records even exist.",

Solved here: https://github.com/furszy/bitcoin/commit/558fcb0c56cb0b50a8dd2c76ed216bb0ed2af58a.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The main thing would be making the \"walletdb: refactor X loading\" commits self contained and not leave behind dead code that needs to be cleaned up later. It's hard to identify what code is being replaced in current commits when not all the code being replaced is actually removed.\r\n2. I think it might be good to move first 2 commits up to \"wallet: Add GetPrefixCursor to DatabaseBatch\" (422a8436089c844934903a61fcec6b7b93995c07) to a different PR. Those commits require a different kind of review than the rest of the PR, and I suspect there are probably wallet developers who'd be perfectly comfortable reviewing the rest of the PR but less comfortable acking the lower level bdb & sqlite code there.\r\n\r\nI left a bunch of review comments, but also posted a branch https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/review.24914.9-edit with suggested changes to fix up the \"refactor X loading commits\"",

It's hard to identify what code is being replaced in current commits when not all the code being replaced is actually removed.\r\n\r\nI've implemented your suggestions and some additional dead code cleanups.\r\n\r\n>   2. I think it might be good to move first 2 commits up to \"wallet: Add GetPrefixCursor to DatabaseBatch\" ([422a843](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/422a8436089c844934903a61fcec6b7b93995c07)) to a different PR. Those commits require a different kind of review than the rest of the PR, and I suspect there are probably wallet developers who'd be perfectly comfortable reviewing the rest of the PR but less comfortable acking the lower level bdb & sqlite code there.\r\n\r\n#27790\r\n",

And I think it would be better to handle more exceptions closer to where they are thrown rather than at the end in a final `catch(...)`. It seems like the PR takes a few steps backwards in these respects. But not in a major way, and not in any way that can't be improved later.\r\n\r\nI'll keep reviewing but for now just left some feedback below on LoadLegacyWalletRecords",

But will wait to see if @achow101 wants to respond to newest comments.\r\n\r\nI like Marco's error handling suggestions since they simplify code and just print all the errors. If it turns out there are this cases where this repeats too many errors, it seems like it would be easy to add a bit of code to LoadRecords that just compares new error messages to previous and adds `[Repeated ## times]` to the log.\r\n\r\nIt would also be great to to look at coverage link https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24914#issuecomment-1609403231 and list places where we should try to add missing test coverage.",

The string errors there are duplicated from the internal walletdb errors. We can just bubble up the error instead of swallowing it.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the unit tests, we usually call `CWallet::LoadWallet` instead of `CWallet::Create`, thus why some of those paths are untested (like the `UNKNOWN_DESCRIPTOR` one, which is tested [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7ee41217b3b3fe4d8b7eb4fd1d4577b9b33d466d/src/wallet/test/walletload_tests.cpp#L50)).\r\n\r\nThat being said, totally agree on adding much more coverage to the area.",

For example if you are looking for keys with prefix `X'FFFF'`, the right condition to check for is simply `key >= X'FFFF'`. It is not `key >= X'FFFF' AND key < X'01FFFF'`.\r\n\r\nYou could fix this by replacing this line with `end_range.clear()`. Then in the `end_range.empty()` case below, prepare the SQL statement `WHERE key >= {begin_range}` instead of `WHERE key >= {begin_range} AND key < {end_range}`.\r\n\r\nThis would fix the prefix scan for prefixes that consist of `0xff` bytes. It would also fix the prefix scan for empty prefixes (by returning all rows), so you could drop the `if (prefix.empty()) return nullptr;` error above too.\r\n\r\nRelated to this, I previously implemented an sqlite prefix scan more simply using the sqlite `instr` function in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7a05b1dee2fa68b32bfb19e273fb55a5b3836a3e#diff-d43e46c8f7010dde905ec31057a1c5c2674df9be11683f98a21546377f2cd706 from #18608. But probably the approach in this PR is more efficient, unless the sql interpreter is doing some fancy rewriting.\r\n",

If the keys are longer than the prefix how would they fit in `datKey` now?\r\n\r\nProbably I am missing something if the code works, but I would expect it look more like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nif (!m_first && !m_key_prefix.empty()) {\r\n    SafeDbt prefix{m_key_prefix.data(), m_key_prefix.size()};\r\n    m_cursor->get(prefix, value, DB_SET_RANGE);\r\n}\r\nret = m_cursor->get(datKey, datValue, first ? DB_CURRENT : DB_NEXT);\r\nm_first = false;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case I'm not missing something and there is a problem with this code, there was a [`BerkeleyBatch::ErasePrefix`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7a05b1dee2fa68b32bfb19e273fb55a5b3836a3e#diff-b06753f6e4621f5bcd6cd27fed4137e70a262596b08f7f3a1416ea21977c53d4) function in #18608 that did something very similar and could be an example.",

Right now, some flows return due corruption right after finish reading all the records of one type, while others continue for a bit longer.\r\n\r\nI'm just not so convinced that worth to log all corrupted records. I don't see much of a benefit for the user, might worth for debugging but in that case, might be better to have an RPC command or an external tool that scans the .dat file and dumps overall info about the wallet (including the corrupted info etc).\r\n\r\nBut no problem, all good if it's to preserve the current behavior.

BDB will malloc a new pointer whether or not you not pass DB_DBT_MALLOC. But you pass it, you are responsible for freeing the pointer, and if you don't pass it, BDB will manage the memory as part of the cursor object so you don't have to free it yourself. If you don't want BDB to malloc memory to return the key, you can pass it a different DB_DBT_USERMEM flag instead.\r\n\r\nThis does raises the question of whether it is ok to call memory_cleanse on memory that is owned by the cursor and should probably be read-only. But maybe it doesn't need to be read-only, or doesn't need to be read-only as long as you are done with the key and about to advance the cursor.",

This would make the database code less fragile and basically catch same programming errors at a higher level in the wallet.",

It looks like this will cause `ReadKeyValue` to not break out of the while-loop and instead continue?\r\n\r\nIIUC, it is ok to catch this exception here because the same exception was also caught previously at the bottom of the ReadKeyValue function here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7be10adff36c0dc49ae56ac571bb033cba7a565b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L781\r\n\r\nand in both cases the exception handler just cause the ReadKeyValue function to just return false. There should be no case when an exception reading one key would cause ReadKeyValue function to throw and break out of the while loop in WalletBatch::LoadWallet. The [`catch (...)`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7be10adff36c0dc49ae56ac571bb033cba7a565b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L920) line around the while loop can catch exceptions, but not ones from `ReadKeyValue`",

I didn't realize that when I was reviewing.\r\n\r\nI think it actually would be preferable to just keep old behavior if that's easily possible, so it doesn't prevent loading wallets which previously just triggered warnings. But I can also see the case for being more strict. I mainly think if behavior is going to change, intent should clearly be documented in the code, and commit message should mention the change. Current commit eddfbcab498a8af200e006aef23fa43ad7c712cb \"walletdb: refactor address book loading\" description makes it seem like there is no change",

Looking at it more closely, I think that actually there's a lot of things that we would have said are non-critical errors but really should be critical, such as corrupted watchonly scripts and keys. These are things that would most definitely result in incorrect balances, but I think we would have allowed loading the wallet anyways. I think the wallet corruption error is a good enough message that people will open issues if they run into it, but I don't think we'll really see any of those since I think several of these should be causing actual other problems.",

IIUC the wallet will fail to load anyway, so might as well return early at the earliest convenience? I am not really a fan of how some types of corruption are ignored/caught and the code continues and others lead to an early abort.\r\n\r\nWild guess: What about throwing instead of using the CORRUPT return code?",

But it would also make this a lot simpler to just abort on the first error.\r\n\r\nThis is still giving NEED_REWRITE error higher priority over other errors besides CORRUPT. And it is adding an early return in the middle of a 211 line function that mostly accumulates errors instead of returning early. If this error needs to be handled differently than other errors and can't be merged with std::max, I think there should a comment calling out the special case and early return. Otherwise better to make this more consistent and write this this as:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp\r\n@@ -865,9 +865,9 @@ static DBErrors LoadLegacyWalletRecords(CWallet* pwallet, DatabaseBatch& batch,\r\n     result = std::max(result, script_res.m_result);\r\n \r\n     // Check whether rewrite is needed\r\n-    if (ckey_res.m_records > 0 && result != DBErrors::CORRUPT) {\r\n+    if (ckey_res.m_records > 0) {\r\n         // Rewrite encrypted wallets of versions 0.4.0 and 0.5.0rc:\r\n-        if (last_client == 40000 || last_client == 50000) return DBErrors::NEED_REWRITE;\r\n+        if (last_client == 40000 || last_client == 50000) result = std::max(result, DBErrors::NEED_REWRITE);\r\n     }\r\n \r\n     // Load keymeta\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Is this for future wallet functionality that builds on descriptors, or is this referring to something in current code?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEDIT: There's a review comment explaining this https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24914#issuecomment-1602997031 that says this is done so a [`LoadActiveSPKMs`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f0720511b0ed814d4568c32066eff1cdc9aef68b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L1162-L1163) call that is added in a later commit doesn't throw.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I'd think it'd be helpful to replace \"Later loading that may reference the unknown descriptor\" with \"ACTIVEINTERNALSPK or ACTIVEEXTERNALSPK records that may reference the unknown descriptor\"",

      "body": "In commit \"walletdb: Refactor hd chain loading to its own function\" (ad779e9ece9829677c1735d8865f14b23459da80)\r\n\r\nThere are two changes in behavior here. One is that if the `CHDChain` value can't be deserialized, the error is now ignored instead of reported. The other change is that the code is now doing an exact match for the DBKeys::HDCHAIN key rather than a prefix match. Arguably the second change is good and unlikely to cause problems. But it's good to be aware in this case, and any in other case that switches from `ReadKeyValue` to `batch.Read` that `batch.Read` is going to match a subset of keys. I've been reviewing this PR for a pretty long time and just realized this now.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking it would be better to avoid changing behavior here and make the code in this function more consistent with:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp\r\nindex dad5c3b531ef..f9c43c04ef31 100644\r\n--- a/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp\r\n@@ -826,10 +826,11 @@ static DBErrors LoadLegacyWalletRecords(CWallet* pwallet, DatabaseBatch& batch,\r\n     }\r\n \r\n     // Load HD Chain\r\n-    CHDChain chain;\r\n-    if (batch.Read(DBKeys::HDCHAIN, chain)) {\r\n-        pwallet->GetOrCreateLegacyScriptPubKeyMan()->LoadHDChain(chain);\r\n-    }\r\n+    LoadResult hd_chain_res = LoadRecords(pwallet, batch, DBKeys::HDCHAIN,\r\n+        [] (CWallet* pwallet, DataStream& key, CDataStream& value, std::string& err) {\r\n+        return LoadHDChain(pwallet, value, err) ?

Or maybe better if it just went away, and wallet code could call `batch.ReadKey` to access values directly.",
