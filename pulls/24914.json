    "body": "Currently when we load a wallet, we just iterate through all of the records in the database and add them completely statelessly. However we have some records which do rely on other records being loaded before they are. To deal with this, we use `CWalletScanState` to hold things temporarily until all of the records have been read and then we load the stateful things.\r\n\r\nHowever this can be slow, and with some future improvements, can cause some pretty drastic slowdowns to retain this pattern. So this PR changes the way we load records by choosing to load the records in a particular order. This lets us do things such as loading a descriptor record, then finding and loading that descriptor's cache and key records. In the future, this will also let us use `IsMine` when loading transactions as then `IsMine` will actually be working as we now always load keys and descriptors before transactions.\r\n\r\nIn order to get records of a specific type, this PR includes some refactors to how we do database cursors. Functionality is also added to retrieve a cursor that will give us records beginning with a specified prefix.\r\n\r\nLastly, one thing that iterating the entire database let us do was to find unknown records. However even if unknown records were found, we would not do anything with this information except output a number in a log line. With this PR, we would no longer be aware of any unknown records. This does not change functionality as we don't do anything with unknown records, and having unknown records is not an error. Now we would just not be aware that unknown records even exist.",

          "title": "wallet, spkm: Move key management from DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to wallet level KeyManager",
          "body": "This PR changes DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan to no longer handle relevant keys directly. Instead all keys for all DescriptorSPKMs will be handled by a new `KeyManager` class which exists within `CWallet` (a reference to it is passed to each DescriptorSPKM). This allows us to have a concept of a wallet HD key for descriptor wallets. This makes it easier to add new single key descriptors that use the same HD master key as the rest of the autogenerated descriptors (e.g. for taproot). Multisigs will also be easier as an xpub belonging to the wallet can be exported without needing to do weird things like descriptor introspection and guessing about which descriptor's key to use.\r\n\r\n`KeyManager` is a class which handles all of the keys for DescriptorSPKMs. It contains the maps that hold the keys, deals with writing those keys to disk, and handles their encryption. Encryption keys are still managed by `CWallet` but provided to `KeyManager` through the `WalletStorage` interface. Signing is still done through `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::SignTransaction` however this will fetch the keys from `KeyManager` rather than storing keys in the DescriptorSPKM to be used.\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards compatible. Although `KeyManager` writes and uses keys in new `keyman_key` and `keyman_ckey` records, it will still write keys for each descriptor in `walletdescriptorkey` and `walletdescriptorckey` records. This allows a descriptor wallet created using this change to be opened by 22.0 and 0.21. Additionally, wallets created with older software will automatically be upgraded to using the `KeyManager` at first loading. This is done in the background and does not require any user interaction (i.e. no passphrase required).",

It takes a BIP32 path as argument and returns the xpub, along with the master key fingerprint.\r\n\r\nTo test this PR:\r\n\r\n* create a regular descriptor wallet\r\n* call `getxpub m/86h/0h/0h`\r\n* call `listdescriptors`, compare the xpub in the `tr()` descriptor with the previous step\r\n\r\n## Bigger picture\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for using Bitcoin Core as one signer in a multisig setup. It simplifies the proposed flow in #22067.\r\n\r\nThe eventual flow would be:\r\n1. Create a blank wallet with a seed (either with no descriptors, or where its single key descriptors are not `active`, so they don't get used when calling `getnewaddress`). \r\n2. Call `getxpub m/87h/0h/0h` (as suggested in [BIP 87](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0087.mediawiki))\r\n3. (Manually, with Specter or with a simple Python utility - TBD): craft a multisig descriptor containing this xpub\r\n4. Call `importdescriptors` which will allow the import if its own fingerprint is recognized (and after checking the xpub)\r\n5. The usual flow with `getnewaddress`, `send` and `walletprocesspsbt` (and their GUI equivalents)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes step (2) possible.\r\n\r\nStep (1) would require a followup, because blank wallets currently can't have a seed. Step 4 would also require a followup,  so that `importdescriptors` treats an `xpub` as if it was an `xpriv`, after checking that it can derive the xpub from the seed (that matches the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nOn the GUI side a wizard could perform the above steps and guide the user, where they either:\r\n* export their own xpub and then import a descriptor from somewhere else (performing some sanity checks); or\r\n* import xpub(s) from other wallets, compose a multisig and get the descriptors for export; or\r\n* get xpub(s) from connected hardware devices and configure a multisig (with or without a key on their machine)",

Please describe.**\r\nAs we all know the more TXes in a Bitcoin wallet the slower and slower it runs.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI had an idea (would be default off of course) where you could set like walletprune=X to whatever number you want and any spent entries in the wallet would be deleted after getting that many confirms. In theory this should greatly speed up wallet activity. This would be completely separate from blockchain pruning which could be on or off.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe main alternative here is rolling your own wallet system or using a service like BitGo for anything more than small projects.\r\n",

Dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of the process.\r\n\r\nThen, for BDB, fixed places where we are flushing to db directly on individual writes. e.g we do it in the in the chain sync/scan process, when an output that belongs to the wallet is found if the address is not inside the address book. \r\n\r\nPlus, in several places across the wallet flows, we create new `WalletBatch` objects. Which, internally, mean: Increasing the db references number, try to open the db and, for SQLite, setup and bind the statements.\r\nThis PR avoids all this overhead by sharing the same db handler instance through each entire workflow.",

Solved here: https://github.com/furszy/bitcoin/commit/558fcb0c56cb0b50a8dd2c76ed216bb0ed2af58a.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please review https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26836 first.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nWe are currently using the address book for different purposes and features in the wallet such us:\r\n\r\n1) Store and retrieve own receive addresses with a label.\r\n2) Store and retrieve external addresses with a label.\r\n3) Store and retrieve payment requests.\r\n4) Mark addresses/destinations as 'used' if they appear on the blockchain (part of the “avoid re-use” feature).\r\n5) Know whether an output is a change or not based on the encoded script.\r\n\r\nSome of these points aren’t well known by many because this code has been spread and obfuscated across the wallet’s sources. (and created in a Frankenstein style).\r\n\r\n#### PR Goals\r\n\r\nEncapsulate the address book functionalities into its own `AddressBookManager` class, so we are able to distinguish properly the address book responsibilities and capabilities.\r\n\r\nBe able to decouple the address book dependency on the wallet’s main mutex (up to a certain point, because we are still using the same db connection).\r\n\r\nClean up the wallet sources further.\r\n\r\nBe able to unit/fuzz test the address book manager implementation isolated from the wallet flows.\r\n\r\nAnd create a new class that can be easily upgraded/replaced, and even different implementations can be used in parallel in different local wallets, by just providing a different manager instance to the wallet in the constructor.\r\n\r\n#### Next steps\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, will be working on improve the ‘change output’ flow which, at least for now, is strictly connected to this process (goal will be to remove the strict dependency).\r\n\r\n#### Pending work (still under WIP, almost there)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Add manager class description.\r\n* [ ] Clean CAddressBookData.\r\n* [ ] Cover the class with unit tests.\r\n* [ ] Double-check commits order.\r\n* [ ] Add addrbook purposes enum.\r\n* [ ] Make cs_addrbook RecursiveMutex a Mutex?\r\n",

          "body": "Add `util::Result` support for returning more error information and make use of it in [LoadChainstate method](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665/commits/584e3fa4ea8ca15b3a8b46e023f218c5e0ed73b0) as an initial application. Followup PR [#25722](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25722) uses it more broadly to return errors and warnings from wallet loading functions as well.\r\n\r\nThis change adds two major features to the result class:\r\n\r\n- For better error handling, adds the ability to return a value on failure, not just a value on success. This is a key missing feature that makes the result class not useful for functions like `LoadChainstate()` which produce different errors that need to be handled differently [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Ability to return error values was actually present in the original implementation of [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218), but unfortunately removed in later iterations.\r\n\r\n- For better error reporting, adds the ability to return warning messages and multiple errors, not just a single error string. This provides a way for functions to report errors and warnings in a standard way, and simplifies interfaces:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -virtual std::unique_ptr<Wallet> loadWallet(const std::string& name, bilingual_str& error, std::vector<bilingual_str>& warnings) = 0;\r\n    +virtual util::Result<std::unique_ptr<Wallet>> loadWallet(const std::string& name) = 0;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options, DatabaseStatus& status, bilingual_str& error);\r\n    +util::Result<std::unique_ptr<WalletDatabase>, DatabaseError> MakeDatabase(const fs::path& path, const DatabaseOptions& options);\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThis change also makes some more minor improvements:\r\n\r\n- Smaller type size. `util::Result<int>` is 16 bytes, and `util::Result<void>` is 8 bytes. Previously both were 72 bytes.\r\n\r\n- Broader type compatibility. Supports noncopyable and nonmovable success and error types.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives & design notes\r\n\r\nThe main goal for the `util::Result` class is to provide a standard way for functions to report error and warnings strings. The interface tries to make it easy to provide detailed error feedback to end users, without cluttering code or making it harder to return other result information. There have been multiple iterations of the design using different internal representations and providing different capabilities:\r\n\r\n|   | Representation (approximate)                   | Notes |\r\n|---|------------------------------------------------|-------|\r\n| _(1)_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Original #25218 implementation in da98fd2efc1a6b9c6e876cf3e227a8c2e9a10827. Good capabilities, but larger type size. Supports error standardized error reporting and customized error handling with failure values. |\r\n| _(2)_ | `variant<T,bilingual_str>`                | Final #25218 implementation in 7a45c33d1f8a758850cf8e7bd6ad508939ba5c0d. No support for returning failure values so not useful in many cases.\r\n| _(3)_ | `variant<monostate,T,F>`                 | Pending #25601 implementation that allows choosing whether to use standardized error reporting or return custom failure values, but doesn't support having both at the same time, like approaches _(1)_, _(4)_, _(5)_, _(6)_ do. |\r\n | _(4)_ | `tuple<variant<T,F>,bilingual_str>`      | Original #25608 implementation in c29d3008de9314dd463ed08e8bff39fe55324498. Basically the same as _(1)_ except it uses separate success and failure types instead of the same type. Using separate success and failure types makes the result class a little less flexible but can help avoid some ambiguity and inconsistent result states. |\r\n| _(5)_ | `tuple<T,optional<bilingual_str>>`        | Final #25608 implementation in dd91f294206ac87b213d23bb76656a0a5f0f4781. Essentially the same as original implementation _(1)_ except has some usability improvements. |\r\n| _(6)_ | `tuple<T,unique_ptr<tuple<F,bilingual_str>>` | Pending #25665 implementation (this PR). Supports returning failure values, uses separate success and failure types to avoid ambiguity, uses `unique_ptr` to reduce result type size, and avoids heap allocation in the happy path. |\r\n\r\n### Prior discussions & history\r\n\r\n- _furszy_ introduced a `BResult` class providing a standard error reporting mechanism in [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218). It was renamed to `util::Result` in [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) but kept the same representation and capabilities.\r\n\r\n- _MarcoFalke_ suggested using `BResult` for the `LoadChainstate` function in [#25308 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25308#issuecomment-1181674645). Inability to use `BResult` there due to lack of support for failure values led to initial work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _w0xlt_ wrote a `StructuredResult` class in [#25308](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25601) adding the ability to return failure values but sacrificing standard error reporting, which led to more work on [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).\r\n\r\n- _martinus_ suggested a space optimization in [#25608 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608#discussion_r921049409) that also made it easier to support distinct failure & success types, leading to [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) as a replacement for [#25608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25608).",

The signature is produced by the private key, and signs the encrypted private key data. It is a schnorr signature. The signature is verified when the encrypted key record is loaded, and if it fails to verify then the loading fails with a wallet corrupted error.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of doing this is to mitigate a common scam where users are given/sold a wallet file that contains \"encrypted\" private keys that correspond to several high valued UTXOs. However the \"encrypted\" keys are not actually encrypted, they are just garbage data. The signature allows the wallet to ensure that the private keys for the stated pubkeys was known at the time of encryption, so it should help mitigate this scam by making it harder for scammers to make high value UTXOs appear to be IsMine.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a downgrade attack where the scammer can continue to do this with a wallet that does not have signatures over the encrypted keys. To mitigate this, the user will get a warning when they open a wallet that has encrypted keys without signatures. When the wallet is next unlocked, the signatures will be generated and written to the wallet file.",

However, once the wallet is unloaded using `unloadwallet` or through program termination, and subsequently loaded again, `loadwallet` updates the `minversion` in the wallet.dat file to `FEATURE_LATEST`, currently 169900.\r\n\r\nThe current logging format prints the very old wallet version during `createwallet`, and then the actual version in calls to `loadwallet`. This has confused at least one person ([reference](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410650.0) - I was the one who asked there if there were plans to change that behavior, and was subsequently redirected here by achow), so it will be very helpful to users to explicitly specify in the logs what the walletdb is doing.",

          "title": "wallet: rpc to add automatically generated descriptors",
          "body": "It is useful to have a RPC that can create and add the automatically generated descriptors (that are normally made during creation) to a wallet. This is especially useful when a new default descriptor has been implemented as it allows wallets created before that time to quickly and easily add that type of descriptor.\r\n\r\nIn particular, descriptor wallets created before Taproot was implemented can use the new `createwalletdescriptor` RPC in order to get a Taproot descriptor.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to keep the newly generated descriptor in line with the existing descriptors, this PR uses #26728 as it exposes a \"wallet extended key\" for us (in addition to upgrading wallets implemented prior to have a wallet xpub). The newly generated descriptors will use the \"wallet extended key\" stored in `CWallet` that PR adds.\r\n\r\n`createwalletdescriptor` is generic and so it can also be used with the other address types. Of course, it given the same wallet extended key, address type, and internal-ness, it will create the same descriptor. So some refactoring has been done in order to detect that the same descriptor is about to be created, and to avoid overwriting any existing descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use `createwalletdescriptor` with the other address types, we need a way to change the wallet extended key, and so `sethdseed` has been updated and enabled for descriptor wallets. As with legacy wallets, when called without parameters, it will generate a new random master key for the wallet. It can also take a xprv and set that as the master key. It still takes a BIP 32 seed as WIF or as hex as we do for legacy wallets. The seed will be transformed into and stored as a BIP 32 extended key. The latter is to give us greater compatibility with other wallets which often produce non-WIF HD seeds.",

Verifying and testing the current behavior before introducing the new features.\r\n\r\nThe following cases are covered:\r\n\r\n1) Two p2wpkh spending transactions with the same hash are received:\r\nThe first one with segwit data stripped, and the second one with segwit data.\r\n   \r\n   Result ->  the wallet will update the stored tx, saving the witness data.\r\n\r\n2) Two p2wsh multisig spending txes with the same hash but a different witness are received:\r\nThe first is added to the wallet via the mempool acceptance flow.\r\nwhile the second one, is added to the wallet via the block connection flow.\r\n\r\n   Result -> the wallet will NOT update the stored transaction. The first received transaction\r\nwill take precedence over any following-up transaction. Detached to the fact that the\r\noriginal transaction didn't get into a block and the second one did.\r\n\r\nExtra Note:\r\nDid it on an unit test merely because wanted to review other parts of the sources while was doing it. Could migrate it into a functional test if reviewers wants it as well.",

          "title": "[Draft / POC] Silent Payments",
          "body": "This PR proposes an early version of [Silent Payment](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/c43b79517e7cb701ebf77eec6dbb46b8) (author:@RubenSomsen).\r\nIn this scheme, the recipient generates a public address, but the sender tweaks the address and the recipient detects the payment by verifying all transactions on the blockchain. An example use case would be private donations.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is not a final version, but to start the discussion and get benchmarks based on a real implementation.\r\n\r\nThis version is built on top of [#994](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/994) (bitcoin-core/secp256k1) for x-only ECDH support and #23480 (bitcoin/bitcoin) for `rawtr()`. Each new silent transaction detected is stored in wallet as a `rawtr()` descriptor. \r\n\r\nIn this implementation, the sender can tweak the recipient address by passing the `silent_payment` option to send RPC. The transaction output will be different from the address entered.\r\n\r\nFor example `./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named send outputs=\"[{\\\"bcrt1pwlh5xuyrpgfunwyww8cfu78yfs2yqyevl7yturavahh5kgxwdd2q5hzgfu\\\": 1.1}]\" fee_rate=1 options=\"{ \\\"silent_payment\\\": true}\"`.\r\n\r\nwill generate `vout` with completely unrelated outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"vout\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 1.10000000,\r\n      \"n\": 0,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(65b19890c5ca40edb816d26f5f48cd9f3ed51121613b1c2405adc1a6dbbc824a)#8myx9tcu\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pvkce3yx9efqwmwqk6fh47jxdnuld2yfpvya3cfq94hq6dkausf9qrfjkgz\",\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": 2.02499835,\r\n      \"n\": 1,\r\n      \"scriptPubKey\": {\r\n        \"desc\": \"rawtr(c45cb3d500bbf8f0c8841e8e011b008781d826c16ee348edb822c0f97419bc4d)#26hcce63\",\r\n        \"address\": \"bcrt1pc3wt84gqh0u0pjyyr68qzxcqs7qasfkpdm353mdcytq0jaqeh3xsuvlykg\",\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny wallet, as long as it has access to private keys, can send silent payments. Thus, this excludes watch-only wallets or wallets with external signers .\r\n\r\nBut the recipient's wallet needs a new flag called `SILENT_PAYMENT`. This flag allows an additional scan that verifies that the wallet keys match the silent payment scheme. When it detects a silent payment that belongs to the wallet, it is stored in a `rawtr()` descriptor.\r\n\r\n`./src/bitcoin-cli -regtest -named createwallet wallet_name=\"recipient\" silent_payment=true`\r\n\r\nTherefore, scanning each address for each transaction is potentially prohibitive overhead, so the node can be initialized with `keypool=1` or a descriptor with range [0,1] can be imported into a blank wallet. Until there is more benchmark data, it is the safest option. The proposal recommends one static address.\r\n\r\nI've been running some silent payments on signet using wallets with default keypool and default range, I haven't noticed any relevant performance drops on the signet node.\r\nApparently this implementation is working as expected but I can't guarantee that the scheme is implemented correctly or safely, so I'm opening this PR for reviews, modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nThere is a new functional test (`test/functional/wallet_silentpayment.py`) that can help to better understand the implementation.",

          "body": "Builds on top of #25907 and one commit from #22341.\r\n\r\nFirst this PR introduces a descriptor wallet RPC `addhdseed`. Similar to its legacy wallet counterpart `sethdseed` it either generates a fresh random seed, for use on a blank wallet, or the user can provide a WIF. Unlike `sethdseed` this RPC call does not add keys / fill the keypool.\r\n\r\nThis allows a user to create a blank wallet (`createwallet`), provide it with a seed (`addhdseed`) and then craft custom descriptors. (An alternative approach would to add a `nodescriptors` argument to `createwallet`, but this RPC seems useful anyway)\r\n\r\nAn example use case of this is setting up a multisig between Core and a hardware wallet. After adding the seed to an otherwise empty wallet, the user would call `getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`. They would then combine this `xpub` and origin info with the one from their hardware wallet (e.g. using `hwi --fingerprint .... getxpub m/87'/0'/0'`  and craft a descriptor like `wsh(sorted_multi(2, [...../87'/0'/0']our_xpub, [..../87'/0'/0']their_xpub))`, and import that. The resulting wallet will be able to sign its part of the transaction.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this PR enables to ability descriptors, such as in the multisig example above, in such a way that any `fingerprint` + `xpub` that is covered by our hd seed(s) can be signed for.",

          "title": "wallet: fix crash on loading descriptor wallet containing legacy key type entries",
          "body": "Loading a descriptor wallet currently leads to a segfault if a legacy key type entry is present that can be deserialized successfully and needs SPKman-interaction. To reproduce with a \"cscript\" entry (see second commit for details):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli createwallet crashme\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli unloadwallet crashme\r\n$ sqlite3 ~/.bitcoin/wallets/crashme/wallet.dat\r\nSQLite version 3.38.2 2022-03-26 13:51:10\r\nEnter \".help\" for usage hints.\r\nsqlite> INSERT INTO main VALUES(x'07637363726970740000000000000000000000000000000000000000', x'00');\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli loadwallet crashme\r\n\r\n--- bitcoind output: ---\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z Using SQLite Version 3.38.2\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z Using wallet /home/honey/.bitcoin/wallets/crashme\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z init message: Loading wallet…\r\n2022-11-06T13:51:01Z [crashme] Wallet file version = 10500, last client version = 249900\r\n\r\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBackground: In the wallet key-value-loading routine, most legacy type entries require a `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` instance after successful deserialization. On a descriptor wallet, creating that (via method `GetOrCreateLegacyScriptPubKeyMan`) fails and then leads to a null-pointer dereference crash. E.g. for CSCRIPT: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/50422b770a40f5fa964201d1e99fd6b5dc1653ca/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L589-L594\r\n\r\n\r\n~~This PR fixes this by simply ignoring legacy entries if the wallet flags indicate that we have a descriptor wallet. The second commits adds a regression test to the descriptor wallet's functional test (fortunately Python includes sqlite3 support in the standard library).~~\r\n\r\n~~Probably it would be even better to throw a warning to the user if unexpected legacy entries are found in descriptor wallets, but I think as a first mitigation everything is obvisouly better than crashing. As far as I'm aware, descriptor wallets created/migrated by Bitcoin Core should never end up in a state containing legacy type entries though.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by throwing an error if legacy entries are found in descriptor wallets on loading.",

          "body": "Currently migrating to descriptor wallets requires having BDB available. In order to remove BDB from the project, we need to be able to do these migrations without BDB. This PR adds `BerkeleyRODatabase` which is an independent implementation of a BDB file parser. It can be used to read uncorrupted BDB files and extract all of their records. This is used for both the wallettool's `dump` command, and `migratewallet`.\r\n\r\nBased on #26606 ",

Because this should\r\nbe affecting other places as well.. (ideally, read-only operations\r\nshouldn't lock the db)\r\n\r\nExtra Info:\r\nHave renamed the long and ugly `wallet_load_verif_crypted_key_checksum`\r\ntest name to `wallet_load_ckey`.",

This makes it easier to create and destroy cursors as well as having cursors that have slightly different behaviors.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since reading data from a cursor is a tri-state, this PR changes the return value of the `Next` function (formerly `ReadAtCursor`) to return an Enum rather than the current system of 2 booleans. This greatly simplifies and unifies the code that deals with cursors as now there is no confusion as to what the function returns when there are no records left to be read.\r\n\r\nExtracted from #24914",

          "title": "Introduce `MockableDatabase` for wallet unit tests",
          "body": "For the wallet's unit tests, we currently use either `DummyDatabase` or memory-only versions of either BDB or SQLite. The tests that use `DummyDatabase` just need a `WalletDatabase` so that the `CWallet` can be constructed, while the tests using the memory-only databases just need a backing data store. There is also a `FailDatabase` that is similar to `DummyDatabase` except it fails be default or can have a configured return value. Having all of these different database types can make it difficult to write tests, particularly tests that work when either BDB or SQLite is disabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies all of these different unit test database classes into a single `MockableDatabase`. Like `DummyDatabase`, most functions do nothing and just return true. Like `FailDatabase`, the return value of some functions can be configured on the fly to test various failure cases. Like the memory-only databases, records can actually be written to the `MockableDatabase` and be retrieved later, but all of this is still held in memory. Using `MockableDatabase` completely removes the need for having BDB or SQLite backed wallets in the unit tests for the tests that are not actually testing specific database behaviors.\r\n\r\nBecause `MockableDatabase`s can be created by each unit test, we can also control what records are stored in the database. Records can be added and removed externally from the typical database modification functions. This will give us greater ability to test failure conditions, particularly those involving corrupted records.\r\n\r\nPossible alternative to #26644",

And cleans up the, now unneeded, wallet `ArgsManager` ref member.\r\n\r\nExtra note:\r\nIn the process of removing the args ref member, discovered and fixed files that were invalidly depending on the wallet header including `util/system.h`.",

          "body": "This is cleanup that doesn't change external behavior. Benefits of the cleanup are:\r\n\r\n- Removes awkward `StringMap` intermediate representation for wallet address metadata.\r\n- Simplifies `CWallet`, deals with used address and received request serialization in `walletdb.cpp` instead of higher level wallet code\r\n- Adds test coverage and documentation\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change externally observable behavior. Internally, the only change in behavior is that `EraseDestData` deletes rows directly from the database because they are no longer stored in memory. This is more direct and efficient because it uses a single lookup and scan instead of multiple lookups.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this cleanup is making changes like #18550, #18192, #13756 easier to reason about and less likely to result in unintended behavior and bugs\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rebased copy of #18608. For some reason that PR is locked and couldn't be reopened or commented on.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an alternative to #27215 with differences described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27215#pullrequestreview-1329028143\r\n",

          "body": "This pull request is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24303 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/18 and more specifically its \"Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel\". This commit was originally authored by empact and is taken from its parent PR #25152.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nThere is an ongoing effort to decouple the `ArgsManager` used for command line parsing user-provided arguments from the libbitcoinkernel library (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25527, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25862, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26177, and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27125). The `ArgsManager` is defined in `system.h`. A similar pull request extracting functionality from `system.h` has been merged in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27238.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\nNext to providing better code organization, this PR removes some reliance of the tree of libbitcoinkernel header includes on `system.h` (and thus the `ArgsManager` definition) by moving filesystem related functions out of the `system.*` files. \r\n\r\nThere is already a pair of `fs.h` / `fs.cpp` in the top-level `src/` directory. They were not combined with the files introduced here, to keep the patch cleaner and more importantly because they are often included without the utility functions. The new files are therefore named `fs_helpers` and the existing `fs` files are moved into the util directory.\r\n\r\nFurther commits splitting more functionality out of `system.h` are still in #25152 and will be submitted in separate PRs once this PR has been processed.",

          "title": "wallet: Keep track of the wallet's own transaction outputs in memory",
          "body": "Currently, the wallet is not actually aware about its own transaction outputs. Instead, it will iterate all of the transactions stored in `mapWallet`, and then all of the outputs of those transactions, in order to figure out what belongs to it for the purposes of coin selection and balance calculation. For balance calculation, there is caching that results in it only iterating all of the transactions, but not all of the outputs. However when the cache is dirty, everything is iterated. This is especially problematic for wallets that have a lot of transactions, or transactions that have a lot of unrelated outputs (as may occur with coinjoins or batched payments).\r\n\r\nThis PR helps to resolve this issue by making the wallet track all of the outputs that belong to it in a new member `m_txos`. Note that this includes outputs that may have already been spent. Both balance calculation (`GetBalance`) and coin selection (`AvailableCoins`) are updated to iterate `m_txos`. This is generally faster since it ignores all of the unrelated outputs, and it is not slower as in the worst case of wallets containing only single output transactions, it's exactly the same number of outputs iterated.\r\n\r\n`m_txos` is memory only, and it is populated during wallet loading. When each transaction is loaded, all of its outputs are checked to see if it is `IsMine`, and if so, an entry added to `m_txos`. When new transactions are received, the same procedure is done.\r\n\r\nSince imports can change the `IsMine` status of a transaction (although they can only be \"promoted\" from watchonly to spendable), all of the import RPCs will be a bit slower as they re-iterate all transactions and all outputs to update `m_txos`.\r\n\r\nEach output in `m_txos` is stored in a new `WalletTXO` class. This class contains references to the parent `CWalletTx` and the `CTxOut` itself. It also caches the `IsMine` value of the txout. This should be safe as `IsMine` should not change unless there are imports. This allows us to have additional performance improvements in places that use these `WalletTXO`s as they can use the cached `IsMine` rather than repeatedly calling `IsMine` which can be expensive.\r\n\r\nThe existing `WalletBalance` benchmark demonstrates the performance improvement that this PR makes. The existing `WalletAvailableCoins` benchmark doesn't as all of the outputs used in that benchmark belong to the test wallet. I've updated that benchmark to have a bunch of unrelated outputs in each transaction so that the difference is demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a larger project to have the wallet actually track and store a set of its UTXOs.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #24914 as it requires loading the txs last in order for `m_txos` to be built correctly.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks:\r\n\r\nMaster:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       92,245,141.50 |               10.84 |    0.1% |  988,823,975.00 |  66,803,340.50 |    0.0% |      2.04 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            5,709.90 |          175,134.50 |    0.5% |       80,968.24 |      25,539.15 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|          139,396.17 |            7,173.80 |    0.6% |    1,383,390.50 |     430,276.86 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            5,055.80 |          197,792.47 |    0.3% |       80,968.10 |      25,539.02 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|                9.79 |      102,152,396.19 |    0.1% |          161.00 |          37.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,552,736.00 |              644.02 |    1.5% |   20,316,315.80 |     618,545.80 |    0.6% |      0.08 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|      114,114,732.00 |                8.76 |    0.5% |1,291,047,717.60 | 320,244,602.00 |    0.0% |      6.30 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      359,315,754.00 |                2.78 |    0.1% |4,339,447,818.00 | 136,619,757.00 |    0.7% |      1.80 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|       98,230,601.00 |               10.18 |    0.1% |  537,688,964.00 |  97,332,266.00 |    0.3% |      0.49 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n\r\nPR:\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |          ins/op |         bra/op |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       75,319,868.50 |               13.28 |    0.2% |  863,758,229.00 |  30,892,593.00 |    0.2% |      1.66 | `WalletAvailableCoins`\r\n|            2,367.62 |          422,364.95 |    1.0% |       35,785.05 |       9,893.01 |    0.2% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceClean`\r\n|            2,685.58 |          372,359.55 |    0.2% |       36,501.05 |      10,027.01 |    0.1% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceDirty`\r\n|            3,462.24 |          288,830.68 |    2.7% |       35,785.06 |       9,893.01 |    0.3% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceMine`\r\n|               11.65 |       85,838,176.97 |    0.1% |          180.00 |          42.00 |    0.0% |      0.01 | `WalletBalanceWatch`\r\n|        1,563,092.60 |              639.76 |    1.5% |   20,426,154.40 |     649,953.80 |    0.6% |      0.09 | `WalletCreateTxUseOnlyPresetInputs`\r\n|       58,367,804.40 |               17.13 |    0.9% |  587,164,005.00 | 107,905,843.80 |    0.1% |      3.21 | `WalletCreateTxUsePresetInputsAndCoinSelection`\r\n|      365,302,636.00 |                2.74 |    0.2% |4,349,345,147.00 | 138,730,668.00 |    0.8% |      1.83 | `WalletLoadingDescriptors`\r\n|      124,995,585.00 |                8.00 |    1.2% |  801,998,316.00 | 103,210,721.00 |    0.3% |      0.63 | `WalletLoadingLegacy`\r\n",

The main thing would be making the \"walletdb: refactor X loading\" commits self contained and not leave behind dead code that needs to be cleaned up later. It's hard to identify what code is being replaced in current commits when not all the code being replaced is actually removed.\r\n2. I think it might be good to move first 2 commits up to \"wallet: Add GetPrefixCursor to DatabaseBatch\" (422a8436089c844934903a61fcec6b7b93995c07) to a different PR. Those commits require a different kind of review than the rest of the PR, and I suspect there are probably wallet developers who'd be perfectly comfortable reviewing the rest of the PR but less comfortable acking the lower level bdb & sqlite code there.\r\n\r\nI left a bunch of review comments, but also posted a branch https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/review.24914.9-edit with suggested changes to fix up the \"refactor X loading commits\"",

It's hard to identify what code is being replaced in current commits when not all the code being replaced is actually removed.\r\n\r\nI've implemented your suggestions and some additional dead code cleanups.\r\n\r\n>   2. I think it might be good to move first 2 commits up to \"wallet: Add GetPrefixCursor to DatabaseBatch\" ([422a843](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/422a8436089c844934903a61fcec6b7b93995c07)) to a different PR. Those commits require a different kind of review than the rest of the PR, and I suspect there are probably wallet developers who'd be perfectly comfortable reviewing the rest of the PR but less comfortable acking the lower level bdb & sqlite code there.\r\n\r\n#27790\r\n",

This TXO set is iterated for balance checking and coin selection preparation, which can still be slow for wallets that have had a lot of activity. This PR aims to improve the performance of such wallets by moving UTXOs that are definitely no longer spendable to a different map in the wallet so that far fewer TXOs need to be iterated for the aforementioned functions.\r\n\r\nUnspendable TXOs (not to be confused with Unspent TXOs) are those which have a spending transaction that has been confirmed, or are no longer valid due to reorgs. TXOs that are spent in unconfirmed transactions remain in the primary TXO set, and are filtered out of balance and coin selection as before.\r\n\r\nDepends on #27286",

And I think it would be better to handle more exceptions closer to where they are thrown rather than at the end in a final `catch(...)`. It seems like the PR takes a few steps backwards in these respects. But not in a major way, and not in any way that can't be improved later.\r\n\r\nI'll keep reviewing but for now just left some feedback below on LoadLegacyWalletRecords",

If it turns out there are this cases where this repeats too many errors, it seems like it would be easy to add a bit of code to LoadRecords that just compares new error messages to previous and adds `[Repeated ## times]` to the log.\r\n\r\nIt would also be great to to look at coverage link https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24914#issuecomment-1609403231 and list places where we should try to add missing test coverage.",

The string errors there are duplicated from the internal walletdb errors. We can just bubble up the error instead of swallowing it.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the unit tests, we usually call `CWallet::LoadWallet` instead of `CWallet::Create`, thus why some of those paths are untested (like the `UNKNOWN_DESCRIPTOR` one, which is tested [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7ee41217b3b3fe4d8b7eb4fd1d4577b9b33d466d/src/wallet/test/walletload_tests.cpp#L50)).\r\n\r\nThat being said, totally agree on adding much more coverage to the area.",

For example if you are looking for keys with prefix `X'FFFF'`, the right condition to check for is simply `key >= X'FFFF'`. It is not `key >= X'FFFF' AND key < X'01FFFF'`.\r\n\r\nYou could fix this by replacing this line with `end_range.clear()`. Then in the `end_range.empty()` case below, prepare the SQL statement `WHERE key >= {begin_range}` instead of `WHERE key >= {begin_range} AND key < {end_range}`.\r\n\r\nThis would fix the prefix scan for prefixes that consist of `0xff` bytes. It would also fix the prefix scan for empty prefixes (by returning all rows), so you could drop the `if (prefix.empty()) return nullptr;` error above too.\r\n\r\nRelated to this, I previously implemented an sqlite prefix scan more simply using the sqlite `instr` function in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7a05b1dee2fa68b32bfb19e273fb55a5b3836a3e#diff-d43e46c8f7010dde905ec31057a1c5c2674df9be11683f98a21546377f2cd706 from #18608. But probably the approach in this PR is more efficient, unless the sql interpreter is doing some fancy rewriting.\r\n",

If the keys are longer than the prefix how would they fit in `datKey` now?\r\n\r\nProbably I am missing something if the code works, but I would expect it look more like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nif (!m_first && !m_key_prefix.empty()) {\r\n    SafeDbt prefix{m_key_prefix.data(), m_key_prefix.size()};\r\n    m_cursor->get(prefix, value, DB_SET_RANGE);\r\n}\r\nret = m_cursor->get(datKey, datValue, first ? DB_CURRENT : DB_NEXT);\r\nm_first = false;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case I'm not missing something and there is a problem with this code, there was a [`BerkeleyBatch::ErasePrefix`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7a05b1dee2fa68b32bfb19e273fb55a5b3836a3e#diff-b06753f6e4621f5bcd6cd27fed4137e70a262596b08f7f3a1416ea21977c53d4) function in #18608 that did something very similar and could be an example.",

Right now, some flows return due corruption right after finish reading all the records of one type, while others continue for a bit longer.\r\n\r\nI'm just not so convinced that worth to log all corrupted records. I don't see much of a benefit for the user, might worth for debugging but in that case, might be better to have an RPC command or an external tool that scans the .dat file and dumps overall info about the wallet (including the corrupted info etc).\r\n\r\nBut no problem, all good if it's to preserve the current behavior. This PR is already doing a lot. Let's keep moving forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSide not, I just had a dejavú. Most likely, we had this convo earlier in the PR and I forgot it..

BDB will malloc a new pointer whether or not you not pass DB_DBT_MALLOC. But you pass it, you are responsible for freeing the pointer, and if you don't pass it, BDB will manage the memory as part of the cursor object so you don't have to free it yourself. If you don't want BDB to malloc memory to return the key, you can pass it a different DB_DBT_USERMEM flag instead.\r\n\r\nThis does raises the question of whether it is ok to call memory_cleanse on memory that is owned by the cursor and should probably be read-only. But maybe it doesn't need to be read-only, or doesn't need to be read-only as long as you are done with the key and about to advance the cursor.",

This would make the database code less fragile and basically catch same programming errors at a higher level in the wallet.",

It looks like this will cause `ReadKeyValue` to not break out of the while-loop and instead continue?\r\n\r\nIIUC, it is ok to catch this exception here because the same exception was also caught previously at the bottom of the ReadKeyValue function here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7be10adff36c0dc49ae56ac571bb033cba7a565b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L781\r\n\r\nand in both cases the exception handler just cause the ReadKeyValue function to just return false. There should be no case when an exception reading one key would cause ReadKeyValue function to throw and break out of the while loop in WalletBatch::LoadWallet. The [`catch (...)`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7be10adff36c0dc49ae56ac571bb033cba7a565b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L920) line around the while loop can catch exceptions, but not ones from `ReadKeyValue`",

I didn't realize that when I was reviewing.\r\n\r\nI think it actually would be preferable to just keep old behavior if that's easily possible, so it doesn't prevent loading wallets which previously just triggered warnings. But I can also see the case for being more strict. I mainly think if behavior is going to change, intent should clearly be documented in the code, and commit message should mention the change. Current commit eddfbcab498a8af200e006aef23fa43ad7c712cb \"walletdb: refactor address book loading\" description makes it seem like there is no change",

Looking at it more closely, I think that actually there's a lot of things that we would have said are non-critical errors but really should be critical, such as corrupted watchonly scripts and keys. These are things that would most definitely result in incorrect balances, but I think we would have allowed loading the wallet anyways. I think the wallet corruption error is a good enough message that people will open issues if they run into it, but I don't think we'll really see any of those since I think several of these should be causing actual other problems.",

IIUC the wallet will fail to load anyway, so might as well return early at the earliest convenience? I am not really a fan of how some types of corruption are ignored/caught and the code continues and others lead to an early abort.\r\n\r\nWild guess: What about throwing instead of using the CORRUPT return code?",

But it would also make this a lot simpler to just abort on the first error.\r\n\r\nThis is still giving NEED_REWRITE error higher priority over other errors besides CORRUPT. And it is adding an early return in the middle of a 211 line function that mostly accumulates errors instead of returning early. If this error needs to be handled differently than other errors and can't be merged with std::max, I think there should a comment calling out the special case and early return. Otherwise better to make this more consistent and write this this as:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp\r\n@@ -865,9 +865,9 @@ static DBErrors LoadLegacyWalletRecords(CWallet* pwallet, DatabaseBatch& batch,\r\n     result = std::max(result, script_res.m_result);\r\n \r\n     // Check whether rewrite is needed\r\n-    if (ckey_res.m_records > 0 && result != DBErrors::CORRUPT) {\r\n+    if (ckey_res.m_records > 0) {\r\n         // Rewrite encrypted wallets of versions 0.4.0 and 0.5.0rc:\r\n-        if (last_client == 40000 || last_client == 50000) return DBErrors::NEED_REWRITE;\r\n+        if (last_client == 40000 || last_client == 50000) result = std::max(result, DBErrors::NEED_REWRITE);\r\n     }\r\n \r\n     // Load keymeta\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Is this for future wallet functionality that builds on descriptors, or is this referring to something in current code?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEDIT: There's a review comment explaining this https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24914#issuecomment-1602997031 that says this is done so a [`LoadActiveSPKMs`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f0720511b0ed814d4568c32066eff1cdc9aef68b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L1162-L1163) call that is added in a later commit doesn't throw.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I'd think it'd be helpful to replace \"Later loading that may reference the unknown descriptor\" with \"ACTIVEINTERNALSPK or ACTIVEEXTERNALSPK records that may reference the unknown descriptor\"",

      "body": "In commit \"walletdb: Refactor hd chain loading to its own function\" (ad779e9ece9829677c1735d8865f14b23459da80)\r\n\r\nThere are two changes in behavior here. One is that if the `CHDChain` value can't be deserialized, the error is now ignored instead of reported. The other change is that the code is now doing an exact match for the DBKeys::HDCHAIN key rather than a prefix match. Arguably the second change is good and unlikely to cause problems. But it's good to be aware in this case, and any in other case that switches from `ReadKeyValue` to `batch.Read` that `batch.Read` is going to match a subset of keys. I've been reviewing this PR for a pretty long time and just realized this now.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking it would be better to avoid changing behavior here and make the code in this function more consistent with:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp\r\nindex dad5c3b531ef..f9c43c04ef31 100644\r\n--- a/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp\r\n@@ -826,10 +826,11 @@ static DBErrors LoadLegacyWalletRecords(CWallet* pwallet, DatabaseBatch& batch,\r\n     }\r\n \r\n     // Load HD Chain\r\n-    CHDChain chain;\r\n-    if (batch.Read(DBKeys::HDCHAIN, chain)) {\r\n-        pwallet->GetOrCreateLegacyScriptPubKeyMan()->LoadHDChain(chain);\r\n-    }\r\n+    LoadResult hd_chain_res = LoadRecords(pwallet, batch, DBKeys::HDCHAIN,\r\n+        [] (CWallet* pwallet, DataStream& key, CDataStream& value, std::string& err) {\r\n+        return LoadHDChain(pwallet, value, err) ?

Or maybe better if it just went away, and wallet code could call `batch.ReadKey` to access values directly.",
